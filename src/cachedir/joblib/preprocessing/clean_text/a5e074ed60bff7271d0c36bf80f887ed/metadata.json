Trump\u2019s \u201cpeople power,\u201d a largely spontaneous uprising of the \u201csilent majority,\u201d against Hillary Clinton\u2019s scientific manipulation of the electorate, using personal data to identify and provoke people to go to the polls. In this effort, Mrs. Clinton has the support of the giant company Google and the president of its parent company, Eric Schmidt. Experts say the effort resembles how the Communist Chinese dictatorship monitors people and modifies their behavior through media manipulation and censorship of the Web. \\nAs Trump suggests, the election process seems \u201crigged,\u201d and the evidence has come in the form of another John Podesta email. \\nOne of the internal Clinton campaign emails disclosed by WikiLeaks shows that Schmidt, chairman of the Google parent company, offered a detailed campaign plan for the Clinton campaign. The April 15, 2014, message, addressed to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, said, \u201cI have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better.\u201d The details included \u201cSize, Structure and Timing\u201d and a campaign budget of $1.5 billion, with more than \u201c5000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers.\u201d The Schmidt email was sent along to several key Clinton people, including campaign chairman John Podesta. \\nThe plan examines how information is received and reviewed by voters, and what provokes them. Indeed, in a section titled \u201cThe Voter,\u201d Schmidt says, \u201cKey is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter.\u201d Schmidt goes on to say, \u201cFor each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote. Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters.\u201d \\nPatrick Wood, editor of Technocracy News, comments that Schmidt\u2019s scoring idea \u201cis just like China\u2019s social scoring of citizens to see who is for them and who is against them.\u201d \\nOn one level, this means that search engine results are manipulated. In his evaluation of the Schmidt email, Michael Cantrell comments , \u201cFor some time now, people have wondered if Google, the world\u2019s largest search engine, might be a tad bit slanted when it comes to politics, favoring left-wing candidates over conservatives in how search results are displayed. Well, it seems those suspicions may not be so far-fetched after all.\u201d \\nEarlier this year, in a column carried by Accuracy in Media, Seton Motley documented how Google was designing its search engine to maneuver people away from the issue of Hillary Clinton\u2019s health problems. \\nIt\u2019s a fact of life that in this era of access to many different sources of information, some people go to the Google search engine and rely on the first item that pops up. That\u2019s how I got banned (temporarily) from the campus of the State University of New York at New Paltz. A feminist professor used Google to search my name and passed around derogatory information from the first source on the search engine page\u2014the Southern Poverty Law Center. She then passed around the information, creating a stink that caused the campus administration to cancel the debate I was scheduled to participate in. \\nA new book, Islamic Jihad, Cultural Marxism and the Transformation of the West , examines the role of Google as a new media \u201cgatekeeper\u201d that determines how people see the reality of the world. The author, William Mayer of PipeLineNews.org , examines how Google produces search engine results on the subject of Islamic terrorism that play down criminal activities of leading Jihadists. Mayer says the results can be confusing unless the search terms are assembled with scrupulous precision, \u201ca difficult task when one isn\u2019t exactly sure in advance the extent of the associations being pursued.\u201d \\nIn his excellent book, Mayer documents in detail the \u201cleftist/Obama/Media merger\u201d that played a significant role in Obama\u2019s 2012 victory and figures prominently in Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan for victory on Tuesday. \\nMayer comments, \u201c\u2026if we think of the Internet as the largest depository of information ever to be created, it assumes in many sense the role of the book of common wisdom. When the universal storehouse of information obfuscates and hides knowledge it becomes censorious, preventing or at least stifling access to non-ideologically approved ideas and information.\u201d \\nWhen Barack Obama campaigns against Trump by citing the KKK, you can rest assured this has been determined by analysts in the Hillary campaign to be at least somewhat effective in scaring blacks. Getting blacks to vote against Trump is a part of what they hope will be their winning strategy. Similarly, when Hillary Clinton campaigns with a profane rapper named Jay Z, the calculation has been made by some brain in the campaign structure that using such a spectacle will inspire other blacks to turn out for the former secretary of state on Election Day. Hillary hopes that the rapper\u2019s popularity will somehow rub off on her. \\nThese two campaign events are more evidence of how truly \u201cscientific\u201d the progressive movement has become. People are perceived by the Clinton campaign as subjects to be manipulated. \\nEven with the use of these scientific techniques, victory is not assured for the \u201cprogressive\u201d forces. That is why reports of vote fraud are mounting as Obama sounds the alarm about the KKK. For Trump to win, the \u201csilent majority\u201d will have to be a real majority with millions of votes to spare, surpassing the artificially created \u201cprogressive\u201d bloc bolstered by fraudulent votes and created by an emerging technocratic dictatorship of access to information. \\nThe \u201cmedia monopoly\u201d that the left used to rail against is now controlled by them.
