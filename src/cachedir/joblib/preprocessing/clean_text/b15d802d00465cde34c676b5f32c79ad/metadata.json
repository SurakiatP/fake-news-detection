[In its stead, the new White House published an explanation of what the Trump team is calling the \u201cAmerica First Energy Plan. \u201d  At press time, the link to the White House page publicizing a plan to combat climate change leads to a blank page. RIP @WhiteHouse climate webpage. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Amy Harder (@AmyAHarder) January 20, 2017,  A cached version of the page shows that President Obama\u2019s administration had used it to advertise a plan to reduce America\u2019s carbon footprint and have America participate in \u201cglobal effort to combat climate change. \u201d \u201cFor the sake of our children and future generations, we must act now,\u201d the page read, \u201cAnd we are. \u201d The Trump administration has instead published a page that lays out its energy plan. \u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil,\u201d the page reads. The page addresses finding economically viable energy solutions that are mindful of the environment: [O]ur need for energy must go    with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water.'"}, "time": 1742561717.561198}
