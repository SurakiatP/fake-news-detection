As democracy flourished, so did their careers. One of them, Paulo Ziulkoski, became the leader of an association of Brazilian cities. The other, Dilma Rousseff, rose even higher, becoming the president of Latin America\u2019s largest country. But their friendship soon fell apart. During a contentious meeting with the nation\u2019s mayors in 2012, Ms. Rousseff rejected pleas for a share of Brazil\u2019s soaring oil revenues. After the room erupted in jeers, Mr. Ziulkoski said, she stormed up to him, poked a finger in his face and humiliated him with a string of expletives. \u201cI never imagined a president could utter such words,\u201d Mr. Ziulkoski said, noting that dozens of mayors have abandoned Ms. Rousseff and her party. To Mr. Ziulkoski, the public dressing down was the kind of rupture that symbolized \u201cthe beginning of the end for her administration. \u201d As Ms. Rousseff wages a   battle to stave off impeachment and save her presidency, she has accused her rivals in Congress of creating  turmoil, saying they are orchestrating a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat to oust her. More than   of Brazil\u2019s lower house voted last month to approve an impeachment measure on charges that she illegally borrowed from state banks to plug budget holes. (She is not accused of stealing for personal enrichment.) Many experts say the next step, a trial in the Senate that could begin in the coming weeks, will probably end in her removal. \u201cI will struggle with all my might until the   are defeated,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said in an interview. But many political analysts say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s   downfall can also be tied to an autocratic persona and a    work style that has driven away scores of political allies, former staff members and cabinet ministers, many of whom have endured searing episodes of public humiliation. \u201cShe\u2019s alienated so many politicians and squandered the good will of so many people, in part because of her terrible political skills but also because of her arrogance,\u201d said Edson Sardinha, the editor of Congresso em Foco, a magazine that focuses on government corruption. \u201cIn her hour of need, very few people are willing to run to her defense. \u201d The upheaval goes far beyond Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leadership style. Brazil is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades, with millions of people falling out of the middle class into poverty. Inflaming their rage, political elites of every stripe have engorged themselves in a   graft scheme involving the national oil company. Ms. Rousseff, who has been politically battered by the scandal, said she was the victim of a naked power grab and sexist assumptions of how a woman should lead. She also said she was a convenient scapegoat for something she cannot control: the global plunge in commodity prices that has sent the economy into a tailspin. But her vow to bring millions of Brazilians into the streets in her defense has produced little popular support. Siding with her opponents are scores of onetime allies, including five former ministers in her administration, the nation\u2019s vice president, and six justices on the Supreme Court who were appointed by Ms. Rousseff or her most powerful defender, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. In more than five years in office, Ms. Rousseff has largely refused to meet with members of Congress, both opponents and allies, eroding the majority support she once enjoyed in the lower house. The aggrieved include Eduardo Suplicy, a former senator and beloved figure in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, who said she had turned down multiple requests for a meeting. \u201cIn politics, either you talk or you die,\u201d said Alfredo Nascimento, a former transportation minister. In April, he voted for her impeachment. \u201cI can\u2019t support a president who is incapable of governing,\u201d he said. In Bras\u00edlia, the capital, most everyone can recount stories about Ms. Rousseff\u2019s intolerance for dissent and her short fuse. The anecdotes include the time she smashed an office computer in anger, her refusal to meet with indigenous leaders or gay rights activists and the castigation of aides for the smallest of infractions. She is also finding little sympathy from the Brazilian news media, which has long viewed her as cold and condescending  \u2014   a marked contrast to the charismatic, backslapping approach of Mr. da Silva. Some agree that Ms. Rousseff is being judged by a double standard that has unfairly tarnished powerful women around the world. Would she be considered so obstinate and uncooperative if she were a man? Or would she simply be called a strong, decisive leader? \u201cThe president is enduring all the stereotypes and prejudices of Brazil\u2019s highly patriarchal and oligarchic society,\u201d said Rosana Schwartz, a historian and sociologist at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI\u2019ve even heard people say, \u2018We will never again vote for a woman.\u2019 \u201d But Antonia Melo, a former Workers\u2019 Party member, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s gruff manner had alienated many of the party faithful. Ms. Melo described a meeting, when Ms. Rousseff was minister of energy, during which activists hoped to make their case against a contentious dam project in the Amazon. Ms. Melo said she had barely finished her first sentence when Ms. Rousseff cut her off, pounded on the table and vowed to press forward with the dam\u2019s construction. Then she turned around and left the room. \u201cWe stood there looking at each other in silence, perplexed,\u201d Ms. Melo said. \u201cWe felt so disrespected and discarded. \u201d The episode was stinging given the origin of the Workers\u2019 Party and Ms. Rousseff\u2019s pedigree as a champion of the disenfranchised. The party\u2019s founders were Marxist guerrillas who rose to power through a coalition of trade unionists, landless farmers, indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals who helped pave the way for the   of democracy in 1985. But that coalition is in tatters. Ms. Rousseff is battling accusations that she hid the depths of Brazil\u2019s economic troubles to enhance her   prospects. Many bedrock supporters are disillusioned by widespread corruption in the national oil company, Petrobras, and by what many describe as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s   after her   in 2014, on several campaign promises to preserve generous government spending. In recent weeks, at least 135 mayors aligned with the Workers\u2019 Party have changed their party affiliations  \u2014   about a fifth of the nation\u2019s mayors who had been elected on the party\u2019s ticket. Among them are Jo\u00e3o Paulo Ribeiro, 31, the mayor of a small city, who said he had grown weary of the attacks by residents and even friends who questioned his association with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party. \u201cI have to listen to the people,\u201d said Mr. Ribeiro, who changed parties last month, hoping to improve his chances for   in October. It is not as if the political figures lining up to oust Ms. Rousseff are viewed as saviors. Many of them are battling serious accusations of corruption, and they were in positions of great power as the country\u2019s   economy ran aground. Rising unemployment and the broad unrest over Brazil\u2019s economy only added to the strains between Ms. Rousseff and Congress. Had the economy been ascendant  \u2014   as it was in 2005 when her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, became embroiled in a   scandal  \u2014   she might have emerged unscathed. The end of Brazil\u2019s bonanza complicated the patronage used to navigate the fractious legislature, in which more than two dozen parties fight for government funding. \u201cWe have a political system based on extracting money from the economy and transferring it to political parties to finance elections,\u201d said Rubens Ric\u00fapero, who served as minister of finance in the  . Many Brazilian economists and policy makers contend that the economic crisis was largely a product of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s own making. She increased the government\u2019s footprint in the economy, spending large amounts on favored industries and corporations to build up national champions. That not only produced an array of big, unfinished projects and bad debt, which now hobbles the   banks, but also opened the door to   corruption. \u201cBrazil insisted in carrying out an industrial policy devoid of logic,\u201d said Arminio Fraga, a former governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. \u201cWhen the government offers companies all sorts of advantages, through protection, subsidies and contracts, it creates enormous space for this sort of thing. \u201d Friends and associates say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s worldview and personality were partly shaped by the three years she was imprisoned by the military, a trauma that included torture like beatings and shocks with an electric baton. As president, Ms. Rousseff has refused to seek vengeance against her torturers, and she was widely praised for backing a National Truth Commission that exposed the abuses of the era but did not mete out punishments to the accused. In 2014, she wept on television after receiving the commission\u2019s final report. An economist and career bureaucrat, Ms. Rousseff, 68, had not held elected office until Mr. da Silva, who was barred under the Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term, picked her to run for president on the Workers\u2019 Party ticket. Mr. da Silva has said he was impressed by her grasp of complex data and her   managerial style. Idelber Avelar, an early member of the Workers\u2019 Party, said Mr. da Silva also viewed Ms. Rousseff as a compliant soldier who would continue his policies and keep the economy humming until he could run again. \u201cClearly, he thought Dilma was somebody he could easily control, a technocrat who would run the machine, which is pretty ironic given that she\u2019s proven to be a disastrous administrator,\u201d said Mr. Avelar, who now teaches at Tulane University in New Orleans. \u201cThe root of all her problems is a profound aversion to politics. \u201d At least 86 cabinet ministers have come and gone since she took office, and only three remain from her first term. Many were forced to resign after being accused of corruption. Nearly   of the 594 members in Congress face serious charges like bribery, electoral fraud, kidnapping and homicide, among them Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the lower house leading the impeachment effort. He has been accused of stashing $40 million in bribes. Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of graft, though many people question her innocence, given her role as chairwoman of the national oil company at a time when the epic kickback scheme was being hatched. In an interview, Ms. Rousseff brushed off suggestions that her disdain for retail politics and the horse trading required to pass legislation had contributed to her woes. She defended her decision to ignore members of Congress. \u201cThere were certain types of blackmail negotiations I would not engage in,\u201d she said. For a time, the Brazilian public viewed her steely resolve positively. During her first year in office, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity stood at 77 percent, among the highest percentages in recent history. These days, that figure is in the single digits. Many Brazilians still admire Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ethics. But after two years of economic turmoil, her televised speeches prompt a cacophony on the streets, as thousands bang on pots and pans to drown out her voice. Few give Ms. Rousseff credit for big achievements, including a landmark freedom of information law and measures that gave federal police and prosecutors new tools to tackle corruption. In some ways, analysts said, Ms. Rousseff has become a victim of those laws, which paved the way for the investigations that have claimed scores of the political and business elite, exposing the depths of Brazil\u2019s political rot. \u201cThis is one of the greatest paradoxes of her fall, because she put in place the machinery that ensnared the politicians who mattered the most,\u201d said Gregory Michener, a professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cDilma did a lot for good government, and I think she ultimately wanted good government, but in the end she wasn\u2019t a good politician because in Brazil\u2019s   party system, she was unwilling to give her allies their fill. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563185.3313818}
