Justin Brown, posted the news on Twitter on Thursday afternoon and confirmed by phone that the motion for a new trial had been granted by Judge Martin P. Welch of the Baltimore City Circuit Court. The decision to grant Mr. Syed, 35, a retrial was a major victory for an inmate who has long maintained his innocence and has exhausted all other avenues of appeal. He was convicted in 2000 in the murder of his former girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, and had served 16 years of a life sentence. \u201cSerial\u201d turned speculation about Mr. Syed\u2019s guilt and whether he had received a fair trial into something of a national pastime in 2014. The show was downloaded more than 100 million times and won a Peabody Award for its role in illuminating flaws in the criminal justice system. At a news conference in Baltimore, Mr. Brown was asked if he thought there was any chance that the retrial could have come about without \u201cSerial. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. On the possibility that Mr. Syed may eventually go free, Mr. Brown said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty confident right now. This was the biggest hurdle. It\u2019s really hard to get a new trial. \u201d On Thursday, Mr. Brown said that he had not been able to reach Mr. Syed to tell him the news, but by Friday, he said in a post on Twitter that his client had been \u201cinformed of the decision. \u201d The family of Ms. Lee has expressed pain and outrage at the attention surrounding Mr. Syed\u2019s bid for a new trial. In a statement released through the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office on Friday, the family said: \u201cWe continue to grieve. We continue to believe justice was done when Mr. Syed was convicted of killing Hae. \u201d For its part, the Attorney General\u2019s Office said Thursday night that it had a responsibility to keep pursuing justice and \u201cto defend what it believes is a valid conviction. \u201d Mr. Syed\u2019s brother, Yusuf, 26, said in an interview on Thursday that the family had high hopes for a favorable decision, based on the strength of the legal arguments and the outpouring of support. \u201cWe really felt 100 percent that the judge would rule in our favor,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting 20 years for this. \u201d Rabia Chaudry, a family friend of Mr. Syed\u2019s who introduced Sarah Koenig, the host of \u201cSerial,\u201d to the case, celebrated the decision online, thanking the judge and witnesses, among others. A production manager for \u201cSerial,\u201d Emily Condon, declined to comment on Thursday. The judge\u2019s decision came after three days of postconviction hearings in February. Mr. Syed and his legal team had presented new evidence, including the testimony of a new alibi witness, and argued that his original defense counsel had been grossly negligent. The   proceedings were held before Judge Welch, a retired judge, who had granted Mr. Syed\u2019s request for a hearing in November. Mr. Syed first filed a request for a postconviction hearing in 2010, but was denied. Mr. Syed\u2019s defense had argued in February that the decision by Mr. Syed\u2019s lawyer in the original trial, Maria Cristina Gutierrez, not to question a state\u2019s expert, Abraham Waranowitz, about the reliability of evidence relating to cellphone towers constituted ineffective assistance. The judge\u2019s decision to grant Mr. Syed a new trial turned on that issue. In a memo, Judge Welch wrote that Ms. Gutierrez\u2019s failure to question Mr. Waranowitz \u201ccreated a substantial possibility that the result of the trial was fundamentally unreliable. \u201d Judge Welch also said in the memo that the substantial public interest in the case did not affect his decision. \u201cRegardless of the public interest surrounding this case, the court used its best efforts to address the merits of petitioner\u2019s petition for postconviction relief like it would in any other case that comes before the court unfettered by sympathy, prejudice, or public opinion,\u201d he wrote. Ms. Gutierrez was a prominent Baltimore defense lawyer in the 1990s whose career crumbled in 2001 when she was disbarred by consent after a state commission uncovered financial improprieties involving her clients. She told The Baltimore Sun at the time that her legal practice suffered in part because of her severe medical problems related to multiple sclerosis. She died of a heart attack in 2004. On Thursday, hundreds of fans of \u201cSerial\u201d took to social media, some of them to celebrate and others to emphasize that they still believed Mr. Syed was guilty. The podcast recently ended its second season, which told the story of Bowe Bergdahl, an American soldier in Afghanistan who was captured by the Taliban in 2009 and released as part of a prisoner swap in 2014.'"}, "time": 1742561712.1965814}
