Bernie Sanders laid out the ways he would leverage his popularity that emerged from the Democratic primary to continue to push Hillary Clinton to the left if she wins the presidency next month. \\nIn an interview published Monday with The Washington Post, Sanders argued that the Democratic Party is \u201cmore progressive\u201d than its presidential nominee. \\nHe emphasized that he saw it as his role to \u201cdemand that the Democratic Party implement\u201d the party platform his allies helped shape, and would be \u201cvigorously in opposition\u201d if Clinton attempted to abandon the platform\u2019s progressive elements. \\n\u201cThe leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people,\u201d Sanders said. He then referenced the number of states he won during the primary, 22. \\n\u201cThat gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use,\u201d he added. \\nThe Vermont senator also emphasized that he would not be cowed by the knowledge that his proposals would not be well received by a likely Republican-controlled House of Representatives.'"}, "time": 1742563146.948121}
