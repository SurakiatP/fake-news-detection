The Left-Green Party also won 10 seats Saturday. \\nThe left-leaning parties \u2014 the Left-Greens, the Pirates and two allies \u2014 won a total of 27 seats, just short of the 32 required to command a majority in Iceland\u2019s Parliament, the world\u2019s oldest. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nThe governing center-right Progressive party lost more than half of its seats in the election which was triggered by Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson \u2018s resignation in April in the wake of the leaked Panama Papers which revealed the offshore assets of high-profile figures. \\nCurrent Prime Minister Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson said he would resign on Sunday. \\nThe anti-establishment Pirate Party, which was founded in 2012, had said it could be looking to form a coalition with three left-wing and centrist parties. \\nThe Pirates\u2019 core issues are: direct democracy, freedom of expression, civil rights, net neutrality, and transparency, all set out in a popular, crowdsourced draft of a new national Constitution that the current government has failed to act on. They also seek to re-nationalize the country\u2019s natural resource industries, create new rules for civic governance, and issue a passport to Edward Snowden.

We knew that we would never get 30%,\u201d Ms Jonsdottir told Reuters. \u201cWe want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics,\u201d Ms. Jonsdottir, 49, who is also a former WikiLeaks activist, said \\n\u201cWe are a platform for young people, for progressive people who shape and reshape our society,\u201d Ms. Jonsdottir told Agence France-Presse. \u201cLike Robin Hood, because Robin Hood was a pirate, we want to take the power from the powerful to give it to the people.\u201d Turnout in Iceland was 79.2%!
