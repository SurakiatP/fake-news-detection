( Here\u2019s the ad itself .) \\nWhen we showed Facebook\u2019s racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer John Relman , he gasped and said, \u201cThis is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find.\u201d \\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 makes it illegal \u201cto make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.\u201d Violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines . \\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits the \u201cprinting or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference, limitation, specification or discrimination\u201d in employment recruitment. \\nFacebook\u2019s business model is based on allowing advertisers to target specific groups \u2014 or, apparently to exclude specific groups \u2014 using huge reams of personal data the company has collected about its users. Facebook\u2019s microtargeting is particularly helpful for advertisers looking to reach niche audiences, such as swing-state voters concerned about climate change. ProPublica recently offered a tool allowing users to see how Facebook is categorizing them . We found nearly 50,000 unique categories in which Facebook places its users. \\nFacebook says its policies prohibit advertisers from using the targeting options for discrimination, harassment, disparagement or predatory advertising practices. \\n\u201cWe take a strong stand against advertisers misusing our platform: Our policies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate, and they require compliance with the law,\u201d said Steve Satterfield, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook. \u201cWe take prompt enforcement action when we determine that ads violate our policies.\u201d \\nSatterfield said it\u2019s important for advertisers to have the ability to both include and exclude groups as they test how their marketing performs. For instance, he said, an advertiser \u201cmight run one campaign in English that excludes the Hispanic affinity group to see how well the campaign performs against running that ad campaign in Spanish. This is a common practice in the industry.\u201d \\nHe said Facebook began offering the \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d categories within the past two years as part of a \u201cmulticultural advertising\u201d effort. \\nSatterfield added that the \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d is not the same as race \u2014 which Facebook does not ask its members about. Facebook assigns members an \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on Facebook. \\nWhen we asked why \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d was included in the \u201cDemographics\u201d category of its ad-targeting tool if it\u2019s not a representation of demographics, Facebook responded that it plans to move \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d to another section. \\nFacebook declined to answer questions about why our housing-categories ad excluding minority groups was approved 15 minutes after we placed the order. \\nBy comparison, consider the advertising controls that the New York Times has put in place to prevent discriminatory housing ads. After the newspaper was successfully sued under the Fair Housing Act in 1989, it agreed to review ads for potentially discriminatory content before accepting them for publication. \\nSteph Jespersen, the Times\u2019 director of advertising acceptability, said that the company\u2019s staff runs automated programs to make sure that ads that contain discriminatory phrases such as \u201cwhites only\u201d and \u201cno kids\u201d are rejected. \\nThe Times\u2019 automated program also highlights ads that contain potentially discriminatory code words such as \u201cnear churches\u201d or \u201cclose to a country club.\u201d Humans then review those ads before they can be approved. \\nJespersen said the Times also rejects housing ads that contain photographs of too many white people. The people in the ads must represent the diversity of the population of New York, and if they don\u2019t, he says he will call up the advertiser and ask them to submit an ad with a more diverse lineup of models. \\nBut, Jespersen said, these days most advertisers know not to submit discriminatory ads: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen an ad with \u2018whites only\u2019 for a long time.\u201d \\nClarification, Oct. 28, 2016: We\u2019ve updated the story to explain more clearly that the ad we bought was not for housing itself \u2014 it was placed in Facebook\u2019s housing categories. \\nJulia Angwin is a senior reporter at ProPublica.
