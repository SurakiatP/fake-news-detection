Certainly not for a yacht cruise in the Costa Esmeralda. This is all about, once again, the Chinese-driven New Silk Roads. \\nHuawei is building its largest European HQ in Sardinia. The Chinese want to buy the port of Cagliari. And fabulous pecorino sardo \u2013 serious contender for best sheep cheese on the planet \u2013 in powdered form, is already feeding millions of Chinese babies. \\nAs a casual extra bonus \u201cMarco Polo\u201d Xi, on Chinese national TV, exhorted his compatriots to invest in a massive tourist invasion of Sardinia. Now this is what a stimulus package in Europe is all about. \\nMeanwhile, lame duck President Obama, also on his way to APEC, is in Germany passing the caretaker \u201cleader of the free world\u201d baton to a dear-caught-in-the-headlights Angela Merkel. The headlights go by the name Donald Trump. \\nTPP six feet under \\nThe sight of an ebullient Xi side by side with a dejected Obama against the background of South America\u2019s Pacific coast will be priceless. Those were the days, in the go-go 1990s, when Bill Clinton ruled APEC, imprinting the American agenda. Now Asia-Pacific has to come to grips not only with protectionist Trumponomics, but also the fact that Obama\u2019s cherished TPP \u2013 the mercantile arm of the \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d \u2013 is, for all practical purposes, dead. \\nTrump\u2019s transition team, led by Mike Pence, has advised him to bury TPP (grouping the US plus 11 Pacific Rim nations) for good within his first 100 days in office. And the road map goes still further, advising him to drop out of NAFTA as well if a long list of \u201cconcessions\u201d is not met. \\nDejected US allies \u2013 mostly Japan, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 who had all been counting on the ascension of Hillary and the enthronization of TPP, are bound to conduct \u201csecret\u201d meetings in Peru aiming at a revised deal. That would have to assume that Republicans in Capitol Hill might agree with Trump having a go at some sort of renegotiation. \\nThen there\u2019s the \u2013 far-flung \u2013 possibility of a cut rate TPP excluding the US. The US and Japan account for roughly 60% of the combined TPP group\u2019s GDP. A TPP without the US is another beast entirely. \\nAnd that leads us to Beijing\u2019s subtle counter-offensive; promoting the anti-TPP along the lines of the still-under-discussion Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which groups East Asia. Japan and Malaysia, as well as non-Asian Australia \u2013 three key players \u2013 all support RCEP. \\nAs much as the Trump-China relationship may eventually land on the proverbial stormy seas, Beijing can now be confident that the China-excluding trade arm of the pivot to Asia is history. \\nHere\u2019s the official spin, via Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Li Baodong; \u201cChina believes we should set a new and very practical working plan, to positively respond to the expectations of industry and sustain momentum and establish a free-trade area in Asia-Pacific at an early date.\u201d No TPP; more like RCEP. \\nAll those resets \\nA new Asia-Pacific trade deal will definitely represent a reset in US-China relations. \\nThen there\u2019s that other crucial reset; with Russia. \\nLame duck Pentagon head Ashton \u201cEmpire of Whining\u201d Carter \u201cadvised\u201d Trump and his team not to cooperate with Russia over Syria. \\nHe was solemnly ignored. \\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Moscow does want cooperation. But he also said Moscow does not intend to \u201cpersuade the Pentagon leadership to change something in this regard.\u201d \\nDiplomatic translation: You \u2013 the Obama administration \u2013 as far as we\u2019re concerned, are dead. \\nSo there will be a reset. It will be extremely complicated, and on a Trumpian deal-to-deal basis: NATO expansion to Russia\u2019s borders; Crimea; US missile defense; color revolution attempts. It will concern all of Eurasia. And it will start with cooperation in Syria. \\nBeijing and Moscow have concluded that Trump is not an ideologue (in the neocon mould); he\u2019s a pragmatist. Resets are inevitable. Even surprises. \\nTrump may be inclined for the US to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), heavily demonized by the moribund Obama administration. His $1 trillion infrastructure plan is something that China has already pulled off \u2013 starting already in the late 1990s. Ellen Brown has a top suggestion; print money, and build all the infrastructure you need. \\nAn eventual US-Russia deal in Syria would ultimately benefit \u2013 who else \u2013 China. Mirroring the original Silk Road, China sees Syria as a crucial node of the New Silk Roads, currently cut off. Picture the day in a not too distant future when Xi will be stopping in Damascus to do trade deals. And to call for a stimulus package of Chinese tourists to visit a restored Palmyra.
