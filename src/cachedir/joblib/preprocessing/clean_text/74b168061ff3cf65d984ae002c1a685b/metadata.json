Mountain \\nElections come and go but when \u201cThe Don,\u201d Barack Obama, meets with his inner circle of Capos every Tuesday morning its breakfast with drones as in the Murder Incorporated assassination program. \\nThink about it, every Tuesday morning in the White House this breakfast club decides who they are going to blow to smithereens that week, with fresh fruit and cappuccinos all around. \\nDoes Obama lie in bed on Monday nights deciding who to have assasinated the next day? You think I am joking? I went to the same school as Barack Obama, I know it torments the brother to blow away all those women and children at those village weddings but someone has to protect Pax Americana . . . right? \\nHear it straight from the mouth of Barack in 2012. \u201cTurns out I\u2019m really good at killing people. Didn\u2019t know that was a strong suit of mine.\u201d . \\nThe criminal absurdity of the right to kill at will without consequence when you head the most powerful military on the planet as the commander in chief seems to be completely lost on the American sheeple. \\nAs a star basketball player in high school Barry O\u2019Bomber, as he was known, left a life of being the only black kid in an elite school of 3,000 to being amongst black Americans for the first time in his life when he left Hawaii for college on \u201cthe continent,\u201d as it is known in the islands. \\nObama spent most of his childhood completely isolated from blacks, had reached early adulthood before having any black friends and then made his career out of being black. Could this explain his sociopathic behavior? \\nI suspect \u201cBarry,\u201d as his white grandmother renamed him, must know about Murder Inc., the national crime syndicate headed by Lucky Luciano in the 1930s who met regularly to decide whom to kill. \\nMr. Luciano ended up serving life in a federal prison only to be released to set up the Italian Mafia nationally after WW2 as a part of the CIA\u2019s forerunners plan for murder and mayhem against the Italian Communist Party to prevent them from winning the postwar Italian elections. \\nImpunity to kill, it runs in American history and Barack Obama finds himself surprisingly good at it. Breakfast with drones, approving the hit list alongside expressos and bagels, Tuesday morning is still Murder Inc. in the Obama White House. \\nThomas C.
