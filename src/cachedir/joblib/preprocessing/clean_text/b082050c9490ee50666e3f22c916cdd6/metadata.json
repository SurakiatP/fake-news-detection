Ms. Massman\u2019s mother, whose politics tilt further to the right, calls it something else: a government school. \u201cMy mother, who is a Tea Party person, started saying \u2018government schools\u2019 all the time,\u201d said Ms. Massman, recalling when she first heard the phrase around 2010. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Wow. \u2019\u201d Kansas has for years been the stage for a messy school funding fight that has shaken the Legislature and reached the State Supreme Court. Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, and his political allies threatened to defy the court on education spending and slashed income taxes in their effort to make the state a model of conservatism. Somewhere along the way, the term \u201cgovernment schools\u201d entered the lexicon in place of references to the public school system. \u201cOur local grade school is now the government school,\u201d State Senator Forrest Knox wrote in an   article last year, echoing conservative concerns that the government had inserted itself unnecessarily into education. The intent was obvious to her, Ms. Massman said. \u201cThey are trying to rebrand public education,\u201d she said. The use of the term has set off alarms even among some Republicans, who fear that it signals still less support, financially and otherwise, for the public schools in a state that had long felt pride over the quality of its education system. The recent adoption of a school finance plan that was acceptable to Mr. Brownback, the Legislature and the Kansas Supreme Court has not entirely assuaged those concerns. Davis Merritt, a columnist for The Wichita Eagle, said in a column in May that state legislators\u2019 \u201cdeaf and blind\u201d ideology was threatening public schools. \u201cSome have begun to call public schools \u2018government schools,\u2019 a calculated pejorative scorning both education and anything related to government,\u201d he wrote. That elicited a response from Bob Weeks, the host of \u201cWichitaLiberty. TV,\u201d a show about Kansas politics and public affairs. \u201cIt is surprising to me that liberals and progressives object to the term \u2018government schools,\u2019\u201d he said on the show. \u201cThey like government, don\u2019t they? These people want more taxation and government spending, don\u2019t they? Well, when we think about our public schools, we find they have all the characteristics of government programs. \u201d Dave Trabert, the president of the Kansas Policy Institute, which advocates limited government, said in an interview: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something that some people use to kind of separate between what\u2019s government and what\u2019s not. Technically, it\u2019s accurate. \u201d It would not be the first time that conservatives have used semantics to sway public opinion, experts said. George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has been tracking the trend for decades. He pointed out that the right has been more successful than the left at framing issues related to abortion, health care, labor unions and the concept of government itself, among other issues, with carefully contrived catchphrases: \u201cTax relief. \u201d \u201c . \u201d \u201cThe Democrat Party. \u201d \u201cDeath panels. \u201d (\u201cObamacare\u201d was originally an attempt by the right to saddle President Obama with the repercussions of the Affordable Care Act, until he embraced the term himself.) Besides coining phrases, Dr. Lakoff said, the right has   certain words  \u2014   a practice that was demonstrated, he said, in President George W. Bush\u2019s second inaugural address, which used \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cliberty\u201d 49 times in 20 minutes. \u201cThe right has taken over the words \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018liberty,\u2019\u201d Dr. Lakoff said. Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, recalled the 1986 speech in which President Ronald Reagan framed perceptions of \u201cgovernment,\u201d to great effect. \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are, \u2018I\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cPeople tend to trace the demonization of government to Reagan,\u201d Dr. Tannen said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of iconic, how he was using it. He set the government up as the enemy. \u201d Conservatives in Kansas have extended the semantical positioning of \u201cgovernment\u201d to education, conveying the message that public schools are a form of government imposition, Dr. Lakoff said. The phrase \u201cgovernment schools,\u201d a common reference overseas to national school systems, has been around for decades as a way to differentiate them from privately financed schools. It has also been a label for schools on Native American reservations, and long used to influence debate. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York used the phrase in 1978 to make the case for federal aid to private schools. \u201cWe have succeeded in providing equality only to those who enroll in government schools,\u201d he said in a speech in New York. \u201cWe have failed the parents who prefer to send their children to the schools that are descended from the older, private school systems. \u201d The Libertarian Party borrowed that for its party platform in 1980. \u201cGovernment schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals,\u201d the platform said. But only recently  \u2014   and mostly in reliably conservative Kansas  \u2014   has the term been used regularly and clearly as a political wedge. Education advocates in Kansas said they had heard it in conversations with state legislators (though few use it in public statements) in discussions about public schools on Facebook and on some conservative news sites. The use of the term \u201cgovernment schools\u201d is part of a broad education agenda that includes restraining costs. The   and libertarian wings of the Republican Party are pushing the state to loosen its laws to allow more charter schools. They oppose programs that offer free or   breakfasts and lunches, believing that schools have become part of the \u201cnanny state\u201d  \u2014   another politically charged term  \u2014   and are usurping the role of parents. Last year, Mr. Knox lamented in his   article, published in a southern Kansas newspaper, that the government had become too intrusive in education. \u201cOur children have become government children,\u201d he wrote. John Locke, a professor of linguistics at the City University of New York, said that in some contexts the use of the word government had a positive connotation: government bonds and   programs, for example. \u201cBut among those archconservatives who, by nature or disposition, want less government, it can have a negative effect,\u201d he said. He suggested, somewhat tongue in cheek, that swapping \u201cgovernment\u201d for \u201cpublic\u201d could become a trend, with references to \u201cgovernment libraries,\u201d \u201cgovernment parks\u201d  \u2014   even \u201cgovernment universities. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s austere,\u201d Dr. Locke said. \u201cIt has an oppressive ring to it. It sounds rigid, the opposite of open or friendly or charming or congenial. The people who use that term are hoping those words will come to mind. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562215.8182724}
