Sarsour was invited by Ayman   the dean of CUNY\u2019s Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. CUNY is standing by its decision to honor the Muslim activist. Such sanction is so malignant and so evil, it cannot be ignored. There is a responsibility for the time we are living in. [We had to reschedule the protest from June 1 (the day of Sarsour\u2019s keynote speech at CUNY) because it is the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, and so many proud Jews wanted to attend. It was wrong for CUNY to schedule the commencement ceremonies on Shavuot  \u2014   the day that the Torah was given by G\u2011d to the Jewish people. Over 25% of the student body is Jewish. The fact that the commencement address is on Shavuot is another reason CUNY should cancel Sarsour and   the commencement. What are Jewish students supposed to do? They either violate their holiday or miss their graduation.  JUST ANNOUNCED: MILO WILL BE SPEAKING. Speakers at our event include: Universities have disinvited Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Nonie Darwish, Ann Coulter, Milo, and legions of conservative thinkers and voices in defense of freedom, but a   and   activist they will defend to the death. We will be there. We will protest  \u2014   this will not stand. Be there  \u2014  MAY 25TH, CUNY Center, 217 E 42nd St, New York, NY   United States, from 12 \u2014   2:00pm. RSVP on Facebook.  An outspoken critic of Israel, Sarsour avidly supports the Boycott, Divestment  Sanctions (BDS) movement, a   initiative that uses various forms of public protest, economic pressure, and lawsuits to advance the Hamas agenda of permanently destroying Israel as a Jewish  .    the ongoing   conflict, Sarsour favors a   solution where an Arab majority and a Jewish minority would live together within the borders of a single country. In October 2012 she tweeted  that \u201cnothing is creepier than Zionism. \u201d In 2004, Sarsour acknowledged that a friend of hers, as well as a cousin, were both serving long sentences in Israeli jails because of their efforts to recruit jihadists to murder Jews. Moreover, she revealed that her    was serving a   prison term because of his affiliation with Hamas. In October 2011, Linda Sarsour, who holds   economics in low regard, expressed, on behalf of \u201cMuslim New Yorkers,\u201d \u201csolidarity and support\u201d for the   Occupy Wall Street movement. In 2011 as well, the Obama Administration honored Sarsour as a \u201cchampion of change. \u201d Not surprisingly, Sarsour visited the White House on at least seven different occasions during Obama\u2019s tenure. In May 2012 Sarsour tweeted that the   \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d an   operative who in 2009 had tried to blow up a   passenger jet in   was actually a CIA agent participating in America\u2019s \u201cwar on Islam. \u201d In November 2012 in Baltimore, Sarsour \u2014  ever eager to peddle her woeful tale of Islamic victimhood \u2014  spoke at a Muslim Public Affairs Council conference titled \u201cFacing Race: Xenophobic Hate Crimes. \u201d This is the same Council that views the murderous   of Hezbollah as members of \u201ca liberation movement\u201d that is \u201cfighting for freedom. \u201d Sarsour was outraged when a police officer and an FBI agent shot and killed a young black Muslim named Usaama Rahim in Boston on June 2, 2015, when Rahim lunged at them with a   knife as they attempted to question him about suspected   activities. Naturally, Sarsour\u2019s assessment of the incident confidently traced everything back to race: \u201cAt the end of the day, a Black man was shot on a bus stop on his way to work and we should treat this like any other case of police violence. \u201d In August 2015 Sarsour spoke out in support of the incarcerated Palestinian Islamic Jihad member Muhammad Allan, a known recruiter of suicide bombers. According to CounterJihad. com, Sarsour has attended and spoken at numerous rallies sponsored by   a group that views Israel as a terrorist, genocidal state whose very creation was a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for Arab peoples. Sarsour has also solicited donations for the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund, which had worked with the   Holy Land Foundation. There\u2019s more. She also initially portrayed the killing of Shaima Alawadi by her husband as a     killing instead. The left\u2019s chokehold on the nation\u2019s most powerful institutions continues, despite a Trump presidency and a Republican Congress, but this is a step too far. Sarsour being given the honor of commencement speaker is so malignant and so evil, it cannot be ignored. There is a responsibility for the time we are living in.
