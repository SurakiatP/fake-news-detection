When it was over on Sunday night, the Pittsburgh Penguins had their second title in eight years and their fourth in franchise history, defeating the San Jose Sharks,  . What turned out to be the winning goal typified the   skill on display throughout the series. The Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby fed defenseman Kris Letang for a   low in the right   circle that found its way into the San Jose net at 7 minutes 46 seconds of the second period. And despite encouragement from the spirited crowd inside SAP Center for the Sharks\u2019 first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals in their   history, San Jose could not find the equalizer before Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist scored an insurance goal into an empty net with 1:02 left in the third period. The game ended when Crosby cleared the puck the length of the ice with San Jose on a power play, and then the celebration began. \u201cMan, I\u2019m going to remember this day for the rest of my entire life,\u201d said the rookie Penguins goaltender Matthew Murray, who faced only 19 shots in the clinching game. Murray, who is 22, added: \u201cI probably won\u2019t believe this until next year, to be honest. It\u2019s so surreal. \u201d Crosby, who had 19 postseason points, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is given to the most valuable player of the playoffs. During his postgame media conference, he drew comparisons with the first cup he won in 2009, his fourth of 11 seasons in the league. \u201cI have a greater appreciation this time around,\u201d the    Crosby said, noting that after    appearances in the finals in 2008 and 2009, \u201cyou just think it\u2019s going to be an annual thing. \u201d \u201cWith the core we have,\u201d he added, \u201cyou think everyone\u2019s going to stay together, the team\u2019s not going to change. But it does. \u201d None of Pittsburgh\u2019s four Stanley Cup wins have come on home ice. Although the Stanley Cup presentation was made inside SAP Center by N. H. L. Commissioner Gary Bettman, thousands of Penguins supporters were able to celebrate at a watch party inside Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh. Center Evgeni Malkin said the championship felt as good as the 2009 title, and he was not surprised that it took so long to win it again. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to win in this league. They have 30 good teams,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cWe played against a tough San Jose team, and they not win in 25 years. It\u2019s not easy. San Jose a great team, great coaches. But it\u2019s tough to win. I\u2019m glad finally we win. \u201d Malkin added: \u201cWe did a great job. Actually, tonight we worked so hard, we deserved to win. \u201d For the fifth time in the six games, the Penguins opened the scoring. With Sharks forward Dainius Zubrus in the penalty box for tripping, Brian Dumoulin\u2019s shot from the left point eluded San Jose goaltender Martin Jones at 8:16 of the first period. Jones, who made 24 saves, was more formidable later in the period, however, making two quick saves on Crosby in a   span after a Sharks giveaway. The Sharks tied the game,   at 6:27 of the second period when center Logan Couture used Penguins defenseman Justin Schultz as a screen and beat Murray with a   wrist shot. The goal was Couture\u2019s 30th point of the playoffs, the best in the league. But Letang answered 79 seconds later, and San Jose could not draw even again. The Sharks, who finished third in the Pacific Division, fell short of their goal, but they went a long way toward erasing their reputation as playoff underachievers with wins over the Los Angeles Kings, the Nashville Predators and the St. Louis Blues. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of our group,\u201d Sharks Coach Peter DeBoer said. \u201cI thought our guys emptied the tank, gave us everything they possibly could. We weren\u2019t as good as them during this   period. \u201d The challenge Pittsburgh presented went beyond their   team speed, he added. \u201cThey have good sticks, too. They force you into quicker decisions. They really challenge your execution. We hadn\u2019t seen pressure and sticks like that through the first three rounds. \u201d Pittsburgh had entered the playoffs as the No. 2 seed in the Metropolitan Division, defeating the Rangers, the Washington Capitals and the Tampa Bay Lightning en route to the finals. The Penguins righted their season after Mike Sullivan replaced Mike Johnston on Dec. 12 as coach when the team was near . 500. \u201cWe changed style,\u201d Malkin said of the coaching change. \u201cBefore, we played more   now we played in offensive zone. We use our legs. We skate with puck, we skate without puck. Always skating. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562769.8794465}
