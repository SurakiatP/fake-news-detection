Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,\u201d Trump said. \\nThe Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. \\n\u201cAssad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,\u201d Trump said. \\nRussia might down US planes \\nMeanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton\u2019s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. \\nSpeaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton\u2019s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. \\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they \u2014 if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cI take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they \u2014 why they did that,\u201d Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. \u201cThe system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It\u2019s very capable. And I don\u2019t think they\u2019d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.\u201d \\nDuring the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. \\nA foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups \u2014 each supported by one foreign country or another \u2014 fighting the Assad government. \\nSince 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. \\nInstead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists, the air raids have killed many civilians, and caused extensive damage to the country\u2019s infrastructure.'"}, "time": 1742562843.9207506}
