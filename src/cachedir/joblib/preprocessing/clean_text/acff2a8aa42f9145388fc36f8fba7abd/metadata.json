Dangerous to what? To their nest of corruption of course. Sure he is dangerous to that, they will go to jail most likely. Evan McMullin who looks like an E.T. with that ugly bold head of his used a different wording though, which is basically the same. He said he doesn\u2019t want a \u201ctrue authoritarian to take power in the US\u201d. Umm sure he doesn\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t like the authority, the rule of law. Nope, he likes the rule of jungle where everybody can be corrupt in peace and be left alone.\\nAccording to his Wikipedia page, he is a former CIA operative who also worked at Goldman Sachs.\\nThose Democrats are so despicable. Its as if the USA fell in the hands of the organized Mafia.\\nIts obvious now this douchebag is a Hillary plant. Perhaps Republicans should have done something similar in California. Have some paid SJW agent trying to steal California away from the Democrats.\\nMcMullin Admits Preventing Trump From Winning is Goal pic.twitter.com/Batqj3iZTv \\n\u2014 MicroSpookyLeaks\u00e2\u201e\u02d8 (@WDFx2EU7) October 23, 2016 \\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742561884.639884}
