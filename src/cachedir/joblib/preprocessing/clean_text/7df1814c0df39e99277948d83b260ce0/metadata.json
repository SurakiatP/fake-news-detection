[Shenkman has waged a campaign against dozens of cities in Southern California for the past several years, using a law called the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) to challenge   election systems as racist. Most cities have capitulated in recent years.  The CVRA allows plaintiffs to \u201cprove\u201d that white voters vote as a racial bloc to exclude minority candidates simply by claiming that a minority candidate might have won but for the fact of being outvoted by the racial majority. The burden of proof is very low. In addition, the law allows successful plaintiffs to recover costs from the cities they sue, if they win  \u2014   but cities are not allowed to recover their own legal costs from plaintiffs if they prevail in court. In 2012, the City of Palmdale, in Los Angeles County, fought Shenkman in court, and ultimately was forced to pay $4. 5 million in a settlement. That experience has been enough to scare many other municipalities away from a fight. But Huntington Beach, located in Orange County, has become the second city in recent months to fight Shankman. The other is liberal Santa Monica, which Shankman alleges has a voting system that discriminates against Latinos, even though the current mayor is Hispanic. The Orange County Register reports: \u201cWe are prepared to vigorously defend any lawsuit,\u201d City Attorney Michael Gates wrote in a May 18 response to the letter\u2019s claim the city\u2019s elections were \u201cracially polarizing, resulting in minority vote dilution. \u201d   \u2026     Gates refuted the notion that the city\u2019s elections create a \u201cracially polarized\u201d process. Gates noted Thursday he had received unanimous backing from the mayor and City Council in closed session and was prepared to defend the city on an array of fronts, ranging from the city\u2019s demographic diversity to the constitutionality of the voting act as applied to Huntington Beach.   \u2026     Beyond factual disagreements, Gates said \u201cthere are also legal arguments where we believe the (voting rights act) has vulnerabilities, and past cases have even discussed that. \u201d The CVRA was once declared unconstitutional by a state court, but that decision was overturned on appeal. Since then, the Supreme Court has invalidated part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on the grounds that evidence of racial discrimination must be shown in order to justify federal \u201cpreclearance\u201d of voting changes in certain states.
