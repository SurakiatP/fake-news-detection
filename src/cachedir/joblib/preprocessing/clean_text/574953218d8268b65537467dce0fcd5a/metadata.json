Limbaugh accused former President Barack Obama of putting it in place before leaving office and said that it is currently being executed. He pointed to the   controversy of Attorney General Jeff Sessions associations with the Russian government and U. S. Senate Democrats   Trump\u2019s cabinet appointees. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anything away from what I said yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m adding to it. We\u2019re watching a silent coup that was put in place by Obama and the Democrats during the transition and before and after the election. \u201d \u201cI think what is happening here is a   effort here to deny Trump the actual control of governing and the government by leaving so many Obama career people appointed, by going so slowly on confirming Trump\u2019s cabinet appointees and other lesser bureaucratic position that remain open and haven\u2019t been filled,\u201d Limbaugh said later in the segment. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it appears the Democrats are still running the show. \u201d Limbaugh went to add if you wanted to know the real saboteurs are, then look for a link between Obama and the Russian government. \u201cI\u2019m telling you  \u2014   if you want to find out who is really working together to sabotage the United States, you find the link between Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian government. That\u2019s the story. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628549.2481375}
