The protection of young women isn\u2019t high on the list of priorities when you work for the Democratic nominee. \\nRedStateWatcher reported that the email detailed lurid claims of private messages to an underage girl being investigated by police \u2013 and was met with the response \u2018oof\u2019 by Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. \\n\u201cPolice on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,\u201d the email read. \\n\u201cTwo officers from the New Castle County Police Department arrived at the girl\u2019s home around 4:30 p.m. and asked to speak with the girl\u2019s mother about the daughter\u2019s contact with Weiner. Another officer appeared at the home a short time later.\u201d \\nWeiner is married to Huma Abedin, Hillary\u2019s top aide. \\nIn June of 2011, an investigation was launched into his online contact with a 17-year-old Delaware high school student. Since then, the disgraced former Congressman hasn\u2019t been able to kick the habit. (Most recently, he was caught sending suggestive photos of himself to a mistress. His son was asleep in the background of one infamous shot.) \\nAbedin herself is now at the center of a fresh FBI investigation into the handling of classified material while Clinton was in office.'"}, "time": 1742628448.9894764}
