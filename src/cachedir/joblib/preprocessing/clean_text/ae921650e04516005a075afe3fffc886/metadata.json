Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication. Words about the dishonest media, the end of Obamacare, the construction of that border wall with Mexico  \u2014   this is an abbreviated list, and he hasn\u2019t even completed his first week in office. Amid the verbal deluge, President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy. Not to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president\u2019s assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally. But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it. This will be a recurring challenge, given President Trump\u2019s habit of speaking in   hyperbole and his tendency to deride any    report as \u201cfake news. \u201d The words needed to be exactly right. \u201cAnd the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth,\u201d said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. \u201cThey\u2019re \u2018baseless,\u2019 they\u2019re \u2018bogus,\u2019 they\u2019re \u2018lies,\u2019 they\u2019re \u2018untruths. \u2019\u201d Rarely are these words, each with its own nuance, applied directly to something said by a president, though others have also dissembled (like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern). \u201cThis is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country,\u201d said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. \u201cWe have an administration that seems to be asserting a right to its own facts and doesn\u2019t seem to be able to produce evidence to back those claims. \u201d Still, carefully chosen words can capture that. \u201cA whole vocabulary has come bubbling up that would not have been used five years ago,\u201d Mr. Nunberg said in an interview. \u201cPeople are going to have to sit down and decide: Are we going to want to go over the moral consequences of telling an untruth? The mere fact of it being untrue? Or the fact that it\u2019s bogus, baseless or groundless?\u201d Some news organizations used words like \u201cfalsely\u201d or \u201cwrongly\u201d  \u2014   adverbs that tend to weaken the impact  \u2014   in framing what the president said. Some used \u201cwith no evidence,\u201d or \u201cwon\u2019t provide any proof,\u201d or \u201cunverified claims,\u201d or \u201crepeats debunked claim. \u201d The New York Times, though, ultimately chose more muscular terminology, opting to use the word \u201clie\u201d in the headline. After initially using the word \u201cfalsely,\u201d it switched to \u201clie\u201d online and then settled on \u201cMeeting With Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie\u201d for Tuesday\u2019s print edition. People noticed, and debated its use. That is because, from the childhood schoolyard to the grave, this is a word neither used nor taken lightly. It stands apart from most other terms in the linguistic ballpark of untruths, including \u201cfalsehood,\u201d which Chuck Todd, the host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d recently used to counter the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s Orwellian phrase, \u201calternative facts. \u201d To say that someone has \u201clied,\u201d an active verb, or has told a \u201clie,\u201d a more passive, distancing noun, is to say that the person intended to deceive. In addition, Mr. Nunberg said, \u201ca certain moral opprobrium attaches to it, a reprehensibility of motive. \u201d The question of intent has informed National Public Radio\u2019s approach to covering Mr. Trump\u2019s many disputable claims: that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, for example, or that the news media had made up a feud between him and the country\u2019s intelligence agencies, despite his own tweets likening those agencies to Nazi Germany. On NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d on Wednesday, Mary Louise Kelly explained that she had looked up the definition of \u201clie\u201d in the Oxford English Dictionary. \u201cA false statement made with intent to deceive,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cIntent being the key word there. Without the ability to peer into Donald Trump\u2019s head, I can\u2019t tell you what his intent was. I can tell you what he said and how that squares, or doesn\u2019t, with facts. \u201d Michael Oreskes, NPR\u2019s senior president for news, supported the decision. In an article on the NPR website, Mr. Oreskes said that \u201cthe minute you start branding things with a word like \u2018lie,\u2019 you push people away from you. \u201d The inherent risk, he suggested, was that news organizations would be seen as taking sides. Editors at The Times also consulted dictionaries. And they had some prior experience with the matter, having approved the use of the L word once before in reference to Mr. Trump. In September, when he grandly announced the findings of a yearslong   investigation into what nearly everyone else never doubted  \u2014   \u201cPresident Obama was born in the United States, period\u201d  \u2014   The Times published a Page 1 article with the headline \u201cTrump Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent. \u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said that he learned of Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments in a text message from an editor on Monday night. After consulting with other top editors, he decided that the use of \u201clie\u201d was warranted. For Mr. Baquet, the question of intent was resolved, given that Mr. Trump had made the same assertion two months earlier through his preferred mode of communication, the tweet: \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. \u201d (Nota bene: The tweet actually contains what might be considered two untruths  \u2014   or falsehoods, or erroneous assertions, or bogus claims  \u2014   since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was no landslide, but among the closer elections in American history.) Mr. Baquet said he fully understood the gravity of using the word \u201clie,\u201d whether in reference to an average citizen or to the president of the United States. He emphasized that it should be used sparingly, partly because the term carries such negative connotations, and partly so that it does not lose potency. \u201cOn the other hand, we should be letting people know in no uncertain terms that it\u2019s untrue,\u201d Mr. Baquet said, referring to the president\u2019s assertion of a   epidemic. \u201cHe repeated it without a single grain of evidence, and it\u2019s a very powerful statement about the electoral system. \u201d Mr. Baquet said that emails from readers seemed split on the appropriateness of the word\u2019s use. Meanwhile, Mr. Benton, of the Nieman Journalism Lab, applauded its use as a noun in the Times headline (\u201cTrump Repeats an Election Lie\u201d) in this construction, he said, \u201cthe lie can exist as a reality distinct from the speaker\u2019s intention. \u201d Over all, the tension between the Trump administration and much of the mainstream media is  \u2014   what\u2019s the word? Troubling, according to Sara Brady, a   specialist based in Florida. She says that a complete breakdown of the already fractious relationship affects everyone. \u201cThe media run the risk of being disrespectful to the president of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the problem is: If he doesn\u2019t get called out in some way, we as Americans are never going to know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. \u201d In other words: Words matter.'"}, "time": 1742561738.2619092}
