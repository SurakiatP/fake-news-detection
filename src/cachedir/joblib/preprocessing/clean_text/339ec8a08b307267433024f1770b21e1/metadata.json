Army Ranger and Benghazi survivor Kris \u201cTanto\u201d Paronto told Breitbart News that he believes former President Barack Obama National Security adviser Susan Rice \u201cneeds to be in jail\u201d for her decision to willfully unmask the identities of United States citizens connected to President Donald Trump\u2019s transition team. [Paronto added, \u201cThe Trump administration has been given the perfect opportunity to set an example, or make an example, out of the type of politician that she is and show these other politicians that they are no longer untouchable. \u201d  \u201cI thought Hillary Clinton was bad,\u201d Paronto said. \u201cThis woman [Susan Rice] surpasses her as far as her evilness and willingness to subvert America with this administration and to continually lie. \u201d He added, \u201cThis woman broke the law. She put lives in danger. She put officers in danger. She put American citizens in danger by doing that. She has no value for human life unless it benefits her politics or benefits her friendship with the crooked administration that was in power for the previous eight years. That woman, at the very least, needs to be in jail. She has no value of human life. \u201d Instead, Paronto suggested Rice lied to protect Obama and questioned her allegiance to the United States. \u201cThere is no gray area she lied. And she\u2019s still protecting her mentor, Obama, from that administration. Her allegiance lies, for some reason misguidedly with them, not with the United States of America. \u201d Paronto also criticized Rice for saying that Bowe Bergdahl served with honor and distinction. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a traitor could serve with honorable distinction and then get six of his fellow soldiers killed trying to find him. The woman has no integrity. She should have no credibility. And honestly, in my opinion, she should be in prison for unmasking and putting American citizens in danger. \u201d While Trump critics and former officials on Obama\u2019s National Security Council did not dispute the report, they argued that Rice did nothing \u201cillegal\u201d in unmasking the identities of those Americans. Conversely, Trump administration officials have not stated that the unmasking was \u201cillegal\u201d but that leaking the identities of the individuals unmasked was. He said he hopes President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions will go after Rice but said, \u201cI don\u2019t think justice will take place because I haven\u2019t seen it yet. \u201cJustice could have taken place with Hillary Clinton because she did violate national security she did lie. Justice could have taken place\u201d when it was discovered that interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile gave Clinton\u2019s camp questions before a town hall debate while she was a contributor to CNN. He added, \u201cJustice could happen with Susan Rice and her lying on national TV continually about a video causing Benghazi when it didn\u2019t. \u201d Rice said it was a YouTube video, not   Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy, that prompted the Benghazi attack that left Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others dead. It was not. Paronto was among four surviving warriors who defended more than 30 American personnel in two American facilities in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The attacks were carried out by the Islamic militant group Ansar  . In addition to Ambassador Stevens, former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty and State Department IT specialist Sean Smith were also killed. \u201cThe Trump administration has been given the perfect opportunity to set an example, or make an example, out of the type of politician that she [Susan Rice] is and show these other politicians that they are no longer untouchable. \u201d He said Rice\u2019s decision to unlawfully unmask the identities of American citizens for \u201cpolitical gain\u201d was a \u201cgift\u201d to President Trump \u201cto set an example. This will influence future politicians from not telling the truth. \u201d Paronto said that when news first broke of the unmasking, he thought, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be hailed a hero by CNN, by MSNBC, by the Washington Post because of what she did. \u201d He added, \u201cBut what she did is not heroic: it\u2019s criminal and unpatriotic. It completely lacks any integrity. \u201d Paronto said, \u201cI guarantee you, in the next week as things start to fall on Susan Rice, they\u2019re going to come to her rescue and label her a hero because they have such a   bias that they cannot see the truth, even if it smacks them across the face. \u201d Asked where he was on the Sunday that Rice suggested it was the YouTube video \u201cInnocence of Muslims\u201d that prompted the deadly Benghazi attack, Paronto said he was in Germany. \u201cI had just woken up and I turned the TV on. I was tired. When I saw the news, I just kind of went, \u2018What the hell?\u2019 I called Jack Silva and I said, \u2018Hey, turn the TV on. Did you guys talk to anybody? Has anybody said anything to anybody? \u2019\u201d Paronto said the next thought he had was of how corrupt the Obama administration was and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s par for the course. And then I went back to bed. They could have thought of a better excuse than that. They could have thought of a better lie. \u201d He said while he was angry, he did not dwell on it because he was \u201cexpecting it\u201d from the Obama administration. \u201cThey don\u2019t want people to know the truth. They just want to continue to lie to maintain power. Something needs to happen, publicly, to an elected official. Leading a public official out in handcuffs would shake things up. \u201d Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) had also suggested there were inconsistencies in what Paronto said regarding a \u201cstand down\u201d order from a CIA officer. Schiff suggested Paronto was dishonest. Asked to react, Paronto said, \u201cHe says he didn\u2019t call me a liar. We talked, and he said we were just getting conflicting information. \u201d Paronto then noted, \u201cSusan Rice was telling  . Well,   to me are lies. And Rep. Adam Schiff from Washington went on Hannity to debate us. \u201d Schiff was was invited but he did not come on to the show. However, Paronto said his issue with Schiff, whose father was also a veteran, is something else. \u201cI have problems with Adam Schiff because when I look in his eyes, I really think he is a good man. But politics has corrupted him so much that I don\u2019t think he knows the truth anymore. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s letting politics dictate his ideology, and he\u2019s wrong,\u201d Paronto said. \u201cHe can\u2019t challenge his paradigm. He can\u2019t challenge that his Democratic beliefs are so wrong. He just can\u2019t accept it. \u201d Kris Paronto currently serves as the Chairman of Leading from the Front, which is part of a   organization, the American Legacy Center.
