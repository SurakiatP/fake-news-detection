After all, Howe was 42 years old. He couldn\u2019t play forever, could he? Picken lived in Hamilton, between Toronto and Buffalo, the new city in the National Hockey League in  . Tickets were easier to score in Buffalo, so Picken, then 20, crossed the border and saw a goal he can still recreate. Howe performed in what now seems like a prehistoric age  \u2014   there were six teams in the N. H. L. for much of his career and interest in hockey was mostly confined to Canada and a few states near the 49th parallel north. Fans of a certain age sometimes talk about Howe the way others do about sporting deities they were lucky enough to see back in the day  \u2014   Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova in a Grand Slam final, Sandy Koufax or Roberto Clemente going around the league one last time, Dr. J defying gravity above the rim, Jim Brown trudging back to the huddle. If you\u2019re smart, you take a mental image, the way Picken did. Luminaries like Howe do not come around every day. Part of Howe\u2019s legend is his No. 9. One Ontario kid would never wear it as a professional, choosing instead No. 99 in homage to his boyhood hero. The photo of the powerful Howe poking the blade of his stick into the mop of hair and prominent ears of a young Wayne Gretzky is one of the great relics of their sport, of any sport. Howe is often considered to be the greatest No. 9 in any North American sport (Ted Williams is second in my rankings). Picken has been a steady email correspondent for a decade or so, enriching me about his loves: hockey, Canada, Japan, birds and waterfalls. He is a friend I have never met. With the awe for hockey that Canadians possess as a birthright, Picken recalled spotting Howe in public once, in Hamilton in 1965, while a bystander to an argument over whose greatness was greater: Howe or Maurice Richard. \u201cHe was a passenger in a convertible going to Dundas for some banquet,\u201d Picken said. \u201cAmazing, because I was 15 and in the back seat of the car with my father driving with a friend of his. They were, literally, arguing over who was better. He continued: \u201cI looked over and saw Howe. I said, \u2018God, there\u2019s Howe in the car next to us.\u2019 They thought I was kidding. \u201d People talked about Gordie Howe with reverence, long before he died this week at age 88. Sightings of legendary figures either confirm our image of them  \u2014   or destroy it. The celebrity as primo jerk we all have our stories. \u201cI knew a guy from The Toronto Star who picked him up at Pearson airport in Toronto about 25 years ago for some function,\u201d Picken recalled. \u201cHe said Howe was incredible. Humble, appreciative and modest. \u201d That is the highest praise a Canadian can lavish on a great athlete from the True North Strong and Free. Humble, appreciative and modest  \u2014   even if he played across the border in Detroit. The mighty right wing was one of the fastest skaters in the league. And he was a good guy. It\u2019s the legend of Gordie Howe. \u201cI bought the ticket well in advance,\u201d Picken continued in his email, \u201cbut was having a fit because he\u2019d been hurt  \u2014   wrist or rib cartilage  \u2014   and had missed a bunch of games. \u201d The Red Wings were playing at Buffalo on Dec. 27 and Howe was back, on a line with Alex Delvecchio and Frank Mahovlich. \u201cI saw him do two things I\u2019ve never seen before or since,\u201d Picken said. \u201cHe was at the right side of the net on a power play and started to shoot the puck,\u201d Picken recalled. \u201cJoe Daley was in net for the Sabres. Howe saw he couldn\u2019t score because of the angle, so he switched from his   shot to his left hand and fired the puck into the far side of the net  \u2014    . \u201d Hockey sticks are slightly curved, to enable the player to better control the puck. By suddenly switching grips, from left hand on top to right hand on top, Howe had given up some power and control, but he furnished surprise, as well as   coordination and power, backed up by an ability to either skate over a defender or flit around him. Mickey Mantle could bunt. Michael Jordan could flick a   pass. Like that. \u201cThere was stunned silence, and suddenly the entire crowd went, \u2018Oohhhhhh\u2019 at the same time,\u201d Picken recalled of the fans from Buffalo and Ontario. The other play Picken remembered was a penalty kill: \u201cHe had the puck and was standing at the blue line. Two Sabres came rushing at him, and he never moved his feet. However, he moved his stick a certain way, and both skated past him. I have no idea what he did. \u201d Grace and power and will. At 42. The Red Wings lost that game, and a week later were beaten by the Maple Leafs,   and eventually finished last in the East Division. Howe played 63 games, had 23 goals and 29 assists, and retired at the end of the season  \u2014   that is, his first retirement. He rested for two seasons, joined the World Hockey Association for six seasons and then roared back into the N. H. L. for a final season, this time with the Hartford Whalers in   and scored 15 goals as he aged from 51 to 52. After that, he was a living icon of his sport, popping up at hockey events  \u2014   a throwback, an ambassador, carrying the aura of one of the greatest stars, but true to the code of modesty. I recall being at one Stanley Cup finals  \u2014   Montreal? New Jersey? Philadelphia?  \u2014   and spotting Howe in a coffee shop, and asking him a few questions while he waited for a spot at the counter. He was a gentleman, although not to the opponents he popped. Some fans like Bruce Picken talk with reverence about Gordie Howe as the greatest hockey player ever. Let\u2019s put it this way: They are entitled.'"}, "time": 1742563604.0468485}
