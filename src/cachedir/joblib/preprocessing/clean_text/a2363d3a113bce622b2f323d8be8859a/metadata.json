Andania, plain and sturdy, pulled into New York Harbor on April 11, 1923, after a slow journey from Liverpool, England. In a   cabin was a   Irishman named Richard Michael Cawley, fleeing poverty and war. The son of a tailor from a rural village, Mr. Cawley, then 20, had come of age during a guerrilla conflict. Now, with Irish fighting Irish, he had made his way to America to join his older brother and uncle. He would settle in Chicago, a city bursting with Irish Roman Catholic life marry a teacher find work as a streetcar driver and sing ballads by the piano on Saturday nights. He would become an American citizen, march in St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades and visit Ireland, looking, one cousin marveled, like \u201ca real Yank. \u201d It is a familiar American tale, except for this: Mr. Cawley\u2019s grandson and namesake, Michael Richard Pence, is the vice president of the United States, which is in the thick of a roiling immigration debate. On Thursday, Mr. Pence, wearing a spray of shamrocks in his lapel, welcomed Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, for breakfast at the vice president\u2019s residence as part of the White House\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day festivities. For Mr. Pence  \u2014   who calls his grandfather \u201cthe proudest man I ever knew, and the best man I ever knew\u201d  \u2014   and his family, it is a deeply personal celebration. \u201cHe\u2019d be busting his buttons, that\u2019s what he\u2019d say,\u201d Mr. Pence\u2019s mother, Nancy Pence Fritsch, 84, said of her father, who died in 1980. The story of Mr. Cawley  \u2014   pieced together from interviews with historians and relatives in the United States and Ireland, as well as archival documents  \u2014   is one of family ties and a man whose experience had an impact on Mr. Pence. Some facts have been lost to time memories do not align perfectly with the written record. When Mr. Pence was a toddler, overshadowed by talkative older brothers, his grandfather taught him to recite \u201cHumpty Dumpty\u201d in Gaelic. As a boy, he shared the older man\u2019s admiration for Presidents John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt, though both eventually left the Democratic Party. He inherited Mr. Cawley\u2019s sense of humor and easy manner, Mr. Pence\u2019s oldest brother, Gregory Pence, said  \u2014   qualities that helped him thrive in politics. Mr. Pence declined to be interviewed a spokesman, Marc Lotter, when asked about Mr. Cawley\u2019s immigration status, said he \u201centered this country through Ellis Island. \u201d Barry Moreno, the librarian and historian at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, reviewed the ship\u2019s manifest and other records and said Mr. Cawley\u2019s paperwork  \u2014   including a 1936 document stating that he had been \u201clawfully admitted\u201d  \u2014   appeared to be in order. Mr. Cawley\u2019s journey does not offer a precise parallel to those of today\u2019s refugees escaping   nations like Syria. Mr. Lotter said President Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict immigrant travel would not have applied to Mr. Cawley because \u201cIreland is not compromised by terrorism. \u201d But with Mr. Pence defending the president, and the Irish  divided over Mr. Trump, it is difficult not to view Mr. Cawley\u2019s experience through the prism of current events. In a recent speech to Latino   leaders, Mr. Pence pledged that he and Mr. Trump would \u201cshow great heart every step of the way\u201d regarding immigration, before recounting his  \u2019s farewell to her son. \u201cShe told him she was going to get him a   ticket to America,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cbecause, she said, \u2018There\u2019s a future there for you. \u2019\u201d Born on Feb. 7, 1903, Mr. Cawley was the third of six children, Irish census records show. The family lived in Doocastle, County Mayo, in a small cottage on a hill outside a village called Tubbercurry, in County Sligo. Older villagers still remember his father as \u201cDick the Tailor. \u201d The Sinn Fein nationalist party declared Ireland\u2019s independence from Britain in 1919, setting off a guerrilla war between Irish and crown forces. That included the notorious British \u201cBlack and Tans\u201d paramilitary group, which waged a night of terror in Tubbercurry in October 1920, burning buildings, including church parish halls, according to Michael Farry, an Irish historian who has documented the war in Sligo. In December 1921, Britain and Ireland signed a peace treaty, only to have civil war break out six months later among the Irish. Then, according to a handwritten ledger from Irish military archives, Mr. Cawley enlisted in the Irish Free State\u2019s army. He felt \u201cpushed into\u201d serving, Mrs. Pence Fritsch said, and was reluctant to fight his countrymen. With little prospect of work, he fled to England, she said, to earn his way to America. The ship\u2019s manifest lists him as a coal miner, with an address near Manchester, and says his brother paid for his passage. In the United States,   and   sentiment was flaring. A   Congress had passed the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, a restrictive immigration law strongly opposed by many   Democratic politicians. Monthly quotas allowed more British immigrants than Irish, who were welcomed as English speakers but faced some suspicion of being radicals. (On the day Mr. Cawley\u2019s ship arrived, The New York Times carried news of Irish rebels.) Many Irish immigrated through Canada. And it might have been easier to gain entry to the United States with a British address, said Richard White, a Stanford historian who has chronicled his own grandfather\u2019s illegal immigration from Ireland to Chicago in 1924. Passing through Ellis Island, Mr. Cawley would have answered an immigration officer\u2019s routine questions, noted on the ship manifest. He was neither sick nor an anarchist, the manifest said. He had the equivalent of $23. And though records show he did not become a citizen until 1941, a decade after he married, historians say that was typical many Irish came to America not quite sure they would stay. While his brother James made his life in New York, Mr. Cawley settled in Chicago. It was a \u201cfully developed Catholic world\u201d of churches, schools and a heavily Irish Democratic political machine, the historian Ellen Skerrett said. In 1927, he was hired as a motorman for the Chicago Surface Lines, a streetcar service later absorbed by the Chicago Transit Authority, which still has Mr. Cawley\u2019s insurance card on file. He held that job, eventually driving a bus, for more than 40 years. By 1931, records show, he had married Mary Elizabeth Maloney, a teacher and   American whose family hailed from Doonbeg, County Clare. (In 2014, Mr. Trump bought a golf course there.) With Mrs. Cawley\u2019s widowed mother, they moved into a tidy brick \u201c \u201d  \u2014   tenants, often relatives, rented the second floor  \u2014   on the South Side. When Mrs. Pence Fritsch, born in 1932, was a baby, her father went home to see his dying mother. \u201cHe was gone so long,\u201d she said, \u201cmy mother worried he wouldn\u2019t come back. \u201d There was not much Irish life in Columbus, Ind. where Mr. Pence grew up as one of six children. (His father died in 1988, and his mother remarried.) Mr. Cawley was 56 when Mr. Pence was born. \u201cI think he was partial to Michael,\u201d Mrs. Pence Fritsch said of her father, \u201cbecause he was named after him. \u201d Holidays meant trips to Chicago. In high school in the 1970s, Mr. Pence would regale friends with an imitation of his grandfather\u2019s soft brogue. By this time, his grandparents were retired and traveled frequently to Ireland. In 1981, not long after his grandfather died, Mr. Pence made his own pilgrimage. The trip was deeply emotional, said Trish Tamler, a cousin of Mr. Pence\u2019s who accompanied him to Tubbercurry. \u201cIt was just something that we all treasured,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were just all so fascinated with the history. \u201d By this time, Mr. Pence had left his Catholic faith to embrace evangelical Christianity, a decision that would redefine him as one of the nation\u2019s most religious and culturally conservative legislators. Grappling with immigration policy, he often invoked his grandfather  \u2014   including in 2006, when he tried unsuccessfully to unite Republicans around a compromise that conservatives attacked as amnesty. \u201cHe got off that boat an Irish lad, he died an American, and I am an American because of him,\u201d Mr. Pence said then. He also warned conservatives to demonstrate \u201cthat we believe in the ideas enshrined on the Statue of Liberty. \u201d Yet he also took tough stances, pleasing the right. A decade before Mr. Trump proposed a border wall with Mexico, Mr. Pence backed a bill that led to the construction of about 700 miles of fencing. As governor, he barred Syrian refugees from Indiana, citing fear of terrorism. In 2013, Mr. Pence took his wife, Karen, and their three children on vacation to Ireland, stopping in Doonbeg, where Hugh McNally, a distant cousin, runs a bar. \u201cThey want to hold on to an identity,\u201d Mr. McNally said. Now, amid the tensions over Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies, Mr. Pence says his grandfather taught him a powerful lesson: \u201cIf you work hard, play by the rules,\u201d he told the Latino leaders, \u201canybody can be anybody in America. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563562.909192}
