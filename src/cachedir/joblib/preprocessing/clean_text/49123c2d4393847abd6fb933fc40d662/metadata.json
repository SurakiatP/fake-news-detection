[National   leader and Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser responded to the announcement of Yoest\u2019s appointment with the following statement:  Charmaine Yoest is one of the   movement\u2019s most articulate and powerful communicators. As the former president and CEO of Americans United for Life, she led groundbreaking efforts to advance     legislation at the state level. She is perfectly suited to take on this role at HHS and it is no surprise to see President Trump once again appoint a strong,   woman to his team. The fact that Yoest will be replacing Kevin Griffis, who now works for Planned Parenthood, is another indication of the dramatic change we\u2019ve seen in Washington since the election of President Trump. This is a new era for the   movement and our fight to protect unborn children and their mothers from the horror of abortion. Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest provider of abortions, reacted to Yoest\u2019s appointment with a tweet expressing its disapproval: Someone with history of promoting #AlternativeFacts shouldn\u2019t be in an @HHSGov position that informs the public. https:  .   \u2014   Planned Parenthood (@PPact) April 28, 2017,  As president of AUL, Yoest worked to emphasize the negative consequences of abortion for both women and their unborn babies and to require young girls to obtain the consent of their parents prior to obtaining abortions. Yoest has been a senior fellow at American Values in Washington, DC.  She served in the White House under President Ronald Reagan in the Office of Presidential Personnel. Additionally, she served as a Trump for President surrogate and a senior adviser to the 2008 Huckabee for President campaign.'"}, "time": 1742561954.2713094}
