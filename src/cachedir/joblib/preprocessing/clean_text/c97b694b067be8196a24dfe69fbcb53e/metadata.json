Trends Russian anti-terror op in Syria , Syria unrest \\nTargeting Russia was \u201ca gross misstep on the part of the human rights defenders,\u201d Konstantin Dolgov said. \\n\u201cIf they call themselves [human rights defenders] they have to be objective. Al least, they have to try to be impartial. How can they assess the human rights situation in Syria in this one-sided manner?
