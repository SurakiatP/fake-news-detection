[\u201cThe bill, which was passed on a   vote, is aimed at boosting   business participation in the state\u2019s developing industry after a disparity study,\u201d the Associated Press reported. \u201cThe vote sends the measure to the Senate, which is considering a separate bill. \u201d  Del. Cheryl Glenn, a Democrat, chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and sponsor of the House bill, was critical of a state commission\u2019s picking finalists for 30 licenses  \u2014   15 for growing and 15 for processing  \u2014   last year that \u201clack minority ownership. \u201d \u201cPassing this bill will show the country that this is not an issue that we\u2019re going lock African Americans and other minorities from participating in this business venture,\u201d Glenn said on the House floor before the vote. \u201cLess than one percent of the licenses held in the entire country are held by African Americans and other minorities. \u201d AP noted that no final decisions have been made on any licenses and that the state commission also has named finalists for 102 marijuana dispensaries. Maryland lawmakers passed legislation to allow medical marijuana production in 2013, but limited it to academic medical centers and none came forward, according to AP. Earlier this year the cannabis industry research and lobbying group, Washington   New Frontier Data, used data from the Barack Obama Labor Department to claim legal medicinal and recreational pot would create 300, 000 jobs over the next three years. The NFD report said the industry\u2019s biggest growth would come from legalized adult recreational marijuana use in states like New York, Illinois, and Maryland.'"}, "time": 1742628493.7939425}
