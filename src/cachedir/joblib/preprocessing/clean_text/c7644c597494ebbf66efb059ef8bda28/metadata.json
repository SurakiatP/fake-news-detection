I said it to the kids, I said look; they\u2019re fuckin\u2019 all out today. Turns out it wasn\u2019t just Waterford, it was countrywide. God help us all\u201d. \\nNo explanation is currently available as to why they\u2019re all out today, but theories range from the changing of the seasons to a comet passing closer to Earth than expected, with others suggesting that the phenomenon is a sign that God is angry with humanity. \\nRegardless, it is important to remain calm, and hope that they won\u2019t be all out tomorrow.'"}, "time": 1742628403.5459754}
