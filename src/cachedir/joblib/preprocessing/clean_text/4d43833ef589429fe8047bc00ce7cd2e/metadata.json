On multiple fronts, like computer hacking and maritime security, ties between China and the United States have frayed during the seven and a half years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. The friction has worsened since the ascension of Mr. Xi as a powerful nationalist leader in 2013. Yet the fact that he and Mr. Obama could set aside those tensions to work together yet again on a joint plan to reduce greenhouse gases attests to the pragmatic personal rapport they have built, as well as to the complexity of the broader United   relationship, a tangle of competing and congruent interests. At a ceremony in this picturesque lakefront city, the two leaders hailed the adoption of the Paris agreement as critical to bringing it into force worldwide. Though widely expected as the next step in the legal process, the move could provide a boost to those who want to build momentum for further climate talks by bringing the December accord into effect as soon as possible. Countries accounting for 55 percent of the world\u2019s emissions must present formal ratification documents for that to happen, and together, China and the United States generate nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s emissions. \u201cDespite our differences on other issues, we hope our willingness to work together on this issue will inspire further ambition and further action around the world,\u201d Mr. Obama declared. Mr. Xi praised the Paris agreement as a milestone, adding, \u201cIt was under Chinese leadership that much of this progress was made. \u201d From the moment he stepped off Air Force One on his final visit to Asia as president, Mr. Obama confronted a resurgent China, undaunted by his efforts to restore America\u2019s presence in the region and poised to capitalize on his troubles in winning congressional passage of his ambitious regional trade agreement, the   Partnership. Mr. Obama\u2019s chaotic welcome on the tarmac captured the mood on the eve of the G20 summit. There were arguments at the airport between White House aides and Chinese security officials who tried to keep back reporters. Shouting matches also broke out between Mr. Obama\u2019s staff and guards over how many people were allowed into the state guesthouse where he and Mr. Xi later met. In recent years, the Obama administration has sought to highlight cooperation on climate change, but China\u2019s commitments, first made in 2014, have been less a concession to American pressure than a restatement of its own goals. They include a promise for China\u2019s carbon emissions to reach a plateau or decline \u201caround 2030,\u201d but without any specific target for reductions like those Mr. Obama pledged for the United States (between 26 and 28 percent of 2005 levels by 2025). That means China has plenty of room to continue burning fossil fuels to power its economy. \u201cThe story of the past eight years is not mainly the pivot or the rebalance it is the very substantial increases in Chinese capacities since 2008,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, who helped formulate Mr. Obama\u2019s Asia strategy as his chief China adviser in the first term. \u201cHow has the U. S. dealt with that?\u201d he added. \u201cHow has the U. S. confronted that?\u201d The Obama administration has experimented with a variety of approaches: pledging to respect China\u2019s \u201ccore interests\u201d in 2009 shifting in 2011 to a more assertive stance  \u2014   verging on containment  \u2014   as Mr. Obama articulated his pivot to Asia then resisting China\u2019s proposal in 2012 to embark on a new model of   relations. To some critics, that was an inconsistent strategy  \u2014   one that alternately cheered or sowed anxiety among American allies, and likewise alienated or emboldened China. Under Mr. Xi\u2019s leadership, China has made aggressive claims to shoals and reefs in the South China Sea, picking fights with neighbors like the Philippines and Vietnam. \u201cThis back and forth has, I think, exacerbated what was already a growing problem with a China that was already more assertive in the context of the financial crisis,\u201d said Michael J. Green, who was the chief Asia adviser on the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration and is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But the administration\u2019s defenders, like Mr. Bader, argue that Mr. Obama was merely following in the tradition of presidents, Democrat and Republican alike, dating back to Richard M. Nixon. They have tried to manage China\u2019s rise by drawing it into the international system and prodding it to accept rules of the road in trade, navigation and other areas. However, China has dismissed a recent ruling by an international tribunal in The Hague that rebuked its aggressive reclamation of land on disputed shoals in the South China Sea and invalidated its historical claims to a large swath of those waters. Mr. Obama was expected to press Mr. Xi to abide by the ruling in a meeting after the climate ceremony, less because he expected the Chinese leader to reverse himself than because the ruling is a vital predicate for undermining the legitimacy of China\u2019s imperial claims. Still, even after Mr. Obama deployed Navy ships to the Pacific, sent Marines to Australia and paid for greater access to the military bases of an old ally, the Philippines, China now has greater control of the South China Sea than it enjoyed at the start of his presidency. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama\u2019s struggle to pass the   Partnership has stoked doubts about America\u2019s economic staying power. The   pact, which excludes China, has become the centerpiece of the pivot to Asia. But it has fallen victim to   politics at home and now seems unlikely to pass, even in a   Congress. Some of the nations that signed on, particularly Japan  \u2014   America\u2019s most important Asian ally and a nervous neighbor of China  \u2014   have made political sacrifices by opening markets in order to meet the standards demanded by the United States. Failure to pass the trade pact, Asian diplomats and analysts said, would leave them feeling burned. \u201cThe Japanese, living in an uncertain world, depending on an American nuclear umbrella, will have to say on trade: \u2018The Americans could not follow through,\u2019\u201d Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore said during a recent visit to Washington, standing next to Mr. Obama. \u201cIf it\u2019s a matter of life and death, whom do I have to depend on?\u201d Mr. Obama and his chief trade negotiator, Michael B. Froman, understand the stakes. They plan a   press to sell the pact on this presidential trip  \u2014   characterizing its passage as a litmus test of American leadership  \u2014   in hopes that the message will echo back home. \u201cWe are one vote away from cementing our leadership in Asia or ceding it to China,\u201d Mr. Froman said in an interview in Beijing. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Congress wants to hand the keys to the castle to China. \u201d The   Partnership is viewed in Asia as the handiwork of Mr. Obama in particular, especially since the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who repeatedly backed it when she was Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, has renounced her support. If Congress fails to pass it, Asian diplomats said, China will emerge as a victor. \u201cIt will be a political disaster and play into the Chinese narrative that China is a geopolitical fact, whereas the U. S. presence is the consequence of a geopolitical calculation which could change and thus is not reliable,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, the ambassador at large for Singapore. In practical terms, the United States would lose the chance to shape the economic future of the region, allowing China to forge ahead with its \u201c  economic order,\u201d which includes a   project to build a new Silk Road linking Asia to Europe. Mr. Bader is among several American officials who are guardedly confident that the next presidential administration will find a way to win approval for the   Partnership, perhaps by adding side agreements on contentious points. But he expressed concern that the South China Sea would be a chronic source of friction. \u201cThe situation hasn\u2019t stabilized,\u201d Mr. Bader said. \u201cAchieving that is beyond the capacity of the U. S. alone. \u201d China has extended its military reach there by building artificial islands with airfields, facilities that American commanders have said they regard as military bases. Although China appears to be taking stock of the situation since the unfavorable ruling in The Hague, Chinese military officials warn that they will continue with their building program in the waterway. \u201cChina will never stop our construction,\u201d the head of China\u2019s navy, Adm. Wu Shengli, said in July. Last month, China took delivery of a dredger, one of the biggest in its inventory, from a Dutch shipyard. The vessel would be suitable for dredging at Scarborough Shoal, a disputed reef 150 miles from the Philippines. China, some academics say, plans to create an extremely large artificial island that would complete a strategic triangle of bases in the sea. \u201cObama is seen as reluctant to push back,\u201d said Alan Dupont, a former defense intelligence analyst for the Australian government. \u201cHe has allowed China to militarize the islands in the South China Sea. The United States hasn\u2019t put it at the top of its list. \u201d To reassure its allies, Mr. Dupont said, the United States would have to reinforce its military presence in the Pacific even further than it has under Mr. Obama\u2019s pivot, or rebalance, as it has also been called. \u201cThere has to be a rebalance plus,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561863.7537234}
