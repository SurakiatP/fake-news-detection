The cat is out of the bag. \\nVia TruthAndAction \\n\\nMany who believed that all of these movements and protests started by Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers and their supporters aren\u2019t about equality at all, they\u2019re about racial superiority, specifically over white people. In fact, if you look up \u201cracism\u201d in the dictionary, it\u2019s basically defined as one race seeking racial superiority.\\nVideo Evidence Below. While speaking to a group of baptists in New Orleans, Tim Kaine suggested that in order to achieve equality between races, white people must willingly submit themselves to a state of repression. What exactly is he talking about exactly? Nobody will deny that slavery and the acts that followed were atrocious, but like it\u2019s been asked many times, what right does anybody have to claim offense at acts they weren\u2019t alive to be offended by?\\nWhy can\u2019t anybody see that this kind of policy isn\u2019t going to bridge the racial divide, it\u2019s only going to make it bigger. It\u2019s this type of thinking, created by the Obama Administration, that got us here in the first place. Not to mention that these types of policies are bad even for white democrats.\\nThese are the types of politics being put into place by democrats and the left as a whole. The sad thing about it is that what black people don\u2019t realize is that these policies only sound good to them because it puts down white people. However, it doesn\u2019t really do anything for them except make them dependent on the government. We\u2019re all hamsters to them, looking for pellets.\\nThe ever-increasing rate at which good-paying, blue-collar jobs are being off-shored by bad trade deals \u2014 something to which the modern Democratic Party appears committed fully \u2014 will continue to have a devastating effect on working-class white communities. The disproportionately negative effect globalization has had on blue-collar whites was a large factor in GOP nominee Donald Trump\u2019s success in the GOP primaries.\\nMoreover, this destruction of the middle American economy is having very real, very negative effects on white Americans. \u201cSomething startling is happening to middle-aged white Americans,\u201d The New York Times reported in 2015. \u201cUnlike every other age group, unlike every other racial and ethnic group, unlike their counterparts in other rich countries, death rates in this group have been rising, not falling.\u201d\\nSome of the Democratic Party\u2019s favorite progressive policies \u2014 like affirmative action \u2014 are directly and openly discriminatory against white Americans. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision this summer in Fisher v. University of Texas gave legal sanction to this obvious form of anti-white discrimination.\\nThen there\u2019s the Democratic Party\u2019s stringent support for open borders and mass non-white migration, which is quite literally turning white Americans into a minority in the country their own ancestors built. White Americans are already a minority among school-aged children, and will be a nationwide minority by 2050, according to predictions by the Census Bureau.\\nAccording to democrats, resistance to their cause is rooted in racism and a desire to protect \u201cwhite-privilege\u201d. If anybody really took the time to think about it, they\u2019d know that that\u2019s racism in itself, trying to breathe life into a myth. The left wants that racist curtain to continue to divide Americans down the middle by making one race look like monsters, mainly white people. This is a toxic form of politics, and will lead to America\u2019s downfall, should it be allowed to continue. This will be Hillary\u2019s America.\\n'"}, "time": 1742628484.1360517}
