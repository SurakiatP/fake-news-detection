In this overwhelmingly Democratic state, Hillary Clinton is poised to dominate the presidential vote. But there will be plenty of drama when it comes to the rest of the state\u2019s doorstop of an election ballot. Outcomes are expected to show the influence of rising power centers in California: Hispanics and young people. Early numbers suggest voters are energized. A record 19. 4 million Californians are registered, according to the secretary of state. By Monday, nearly five million votes were already cast. In Los Angeles County over the weekend, some people waited up to four hours in line to vote early, The Los Angeles Times reported. Mindy Romero, who runs the California Civic Engagement Project at U. C. Davis, said on Monday that even though we are not a swing state, many people are being propelled by anxiety over the nation\u2019s direction. \u201cPeople do think that in this election there is something at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, if nothing else, the fear factor among many voters about the other candidate is driving things. \u201d Some of the contests that we will be following closely as votes roll in: \u2022 Attorney General Kamala Harris is the favorite against Representative Loretta Sanchez in the race for United States Senate. Either would be the first woman of color to hold the office from California. \u2022 Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who embraced Donald Trump, faces a threat to the seat he has held in Southern California since 2000 from the Democrat Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel. \u2022   sentiment could tip votes against other Republican incumbents in Congress as well.  Jeff Denham and David Valadao, both in the Central Valley, and Steve Knight, in the Lancaster area, were all seen as vulnerable. The nation will be also watching trendsetting California on several crucial ballot propositions: \u2022 Will the state become the heaviest domino yet to fall in the nationwide push to legalize recreational marijuana? \u2022 Will voters abolish the death penalty? \u2022 Will a measure intended to lower prescription drug prices prevail despite more than $100 million spent to defeat it? \u2022 And how will Californians come down on a raft of taxation and   questions that could shore up schools and other public projects, but also saddle the state with more debt.

[Sacramento Bee] Think you\u2019re voting to make the world a better place? That may be so, but researchers have also found a less noble driver of voter participation. Shame, or specifically the fear of it. Studies have shown that up to half of nonvoters lie when asked if they cast a ballot. In a new academic paper, behavioral economists from U. C. Berkeley, the University of Chicago and Harvard sought to measure the amount of shame that nonvoters experience. To figure it out, they went to a Chicago suburb after a 2010 congressional election and surveyed both voters and nonvoters. Using financial incentives and election turnout data, they were able to measure how painful it was for people who did not vote to acknowledge it. \u201cThe results document substantial shame from admitting to not voting, though little evidence of pride from conversely claiming to vote,\u201d according to the study. For campaigns, that suggests it may be fruitful to drop hints to potential supporters, for example, that Grandma may be inquiring later about their vote. Stefano DellaVigna, a professor of economics at U. C. Berkeley and one of the study\u2019s authors, said the reasons people vote are myriad, not least among them a desire to be counted. But concerns over social standing play a crucial part. If deployed to your side\u2019s advantage, Professor DellaVigna said, \u201cthat might flip it in close elections. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.
