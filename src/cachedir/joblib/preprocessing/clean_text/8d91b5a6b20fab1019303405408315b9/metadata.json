Skakel, who was found guilty in 2002 of bludgeoning a teenage neighbor with a golf club, should be reinstated. The court said in making its ruling that Mr. Skakel\u2019s original lawyer had, despite accusations to the contrary, represented him effectively. The decision could send Mr. Skakel back to prison to finish a prison term of 20 years to life. He had spent more than a decade behind bars before he was released in 2013 when a judge vacated his original sentence. Over the years, Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, has attracted the attention of gossip columnists, TV crews and magazine writers as his case slowly moved through nearly every branch of Connecticut\u2019s judicial system. Though the neighbor, Martha Moxley, was killed in Greenwich in 1975, when she and Mr. Skakel were both 15, Mr. Skakel was not arrested until he was in his late 30s. He was convicted after a   trial that brought to light details including his drinking and drug use. But in October 2013, 38 years after Ms. Moxley was found dead, lying face down beneath a pine tree on her family\u2019s estate, a Connecticut judge vacated the guilty verdict, ruling that Mr. Skakel\u2019s trial lawyer, Michael Sherman, had not provided effective representation. At that time, Mr. Skakel and his new legal team argued that Mr. Sherman had failed to implicate his brother, Thomas Skakel, in the murder, one of their main arguments at trial failed to adequately pursue an alibi defense and failed to rebut the testimony of some former schoolmates who said that Mr. Skakel had admitted to the killing. In subsequent arguments, Mr. Skakel\u2019s lawyers also attacked Mr. Sherman for delivering a poor closing argument and for having a conflict of interest in representing him related to how he billed Mr. Skakel. But in a   decision issued on Friday, the Supreme Court said that Mr. Sherman\u2019s legal work was not deficient. Mr. Skakel \u201chad the burden to present evidence demonstrating that Sherman\u2019s investigation was constitutionally inadequate,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cIn the absence of this evidence, we must presume that Sherman performed competently. \u201d Prosecutors have not responded to requests about the next steps for the case. In a telephone interview on Friday evening, Mr. Sherman said that while it was \u201ca comfort to see that the judges did not feel I was responsible,\u201d the reinstatement of the guilty verdict was not \u201ca situation where I\u2019m happier than hell and kicking my heels in joy. \u201d He maintained that Mr. Skakel had been wrongfully convicted. \u201cIt happened on my watch, and I\u2019m responsible for that,\u201d Mr. Sherman said, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that any judge or prosecutor will send him back to jail after the odyssey he\u2019s been on. \u201d Robert F. Kennedy Jr. an environmental lawyer and a cousin of Mr. Skakel\u2019s who wrote a book last year making a case for Mr. Skakel\u2019s innocence, called the court\u2019s decision \u201ca horrible, cataclysmic miscarriage of justice. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s O. K. going back to prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit while the real murderers are on the street because the State of Connecticut can\u2019t admit it made a horrible mistake by convicting him in the first place,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was in essence a defense of Mr. Sherman\u2019s defense of Mr. Skakel. It pulled apart the lower court\u2019s decision to vacate the conviction point by point. According to the ruling, Mr. Sherman had a threefold strategy at Mr. Skakel\u2019s trial. Mr. Sherman tried to establish an alibi, saying that Mr. Skakel was at a cousin\u2019s house watching Monty Python on television at the time of the murder. He tried to discredit witnesses who had gone to school with Mr. Skakel and who had said Mr. Skakel told them he was involved in the killing. And he presented evidence that the family\u2019s   tutor, Kenneth Littleton, might have committed the murder. Mr. Skakel\u2019s current lawyers did not return phone calls seeking comment.'"}, "time": 1742564113.6468186}
