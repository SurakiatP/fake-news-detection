[Border Patrol agents allowed six families to be temporarily reunited on Sunday at the \u201cDoor of Hope\u201d The San Diego   reported.  The event, held for the fifth year in a row, took place at Friendship Park \u2014  where the U. S.  Border separates San Diego from Tijuana. Families were allowed a   window to embrace their loved ones as the event celebrated Mexico\u2019s National Children\u2019s Day. The San Diego   highlighted the emotional toll that can take place when families are separated. Lorenzo, 31, was able to see her mother for the first time in years. Her mother traveled to Mexico in 2010 to visit family and thought she would be able to return to the United States easily. She was wrong, and what they thought would be a   ordeal turned into a   separation for the family. What was not mentioned in the article was the fact that this family became separated under the Obama Administration. The article proceeded to play on readers\u2019 emotions by highlighting the fears that illegal immigrants have of being deported by President Trump. \u201cMost of my family is scared, really scared,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cMy mom lost a little more hope. \u201d Writing for the San Diego   in 2015, John Fanestil wrote a piece titled Friendship trumps racism at San Diego border park. Fanestil asks readers to \u201cjoin us in saying \u2018no\u2019 to racism and #YesToFriendship. \u201d The author describes the San   region as, \u201ccharacterized principally by productive, binational relationships spanning social sectors from business to higher education, from food to arts and culture, from environment to   from tourism to religious and social justice organizing. \u201d The article fails to mention for the years 2015 and 2016, there were 1, 580 murders in Tijuana, which is more than Chicago had in the same time span. In one instance, a Mexican cartel took the fight to law enforcement in Tijuana, shooting a total of 20 police officers, only five survived, according to Breitbart Texas reporting at the time. The Sinaloa Cartel builds elaborate smuggling tunnels in the Tijuana area to ship   quantities of narcotics worth tens of millions of dollars into the United States through San Diego.
