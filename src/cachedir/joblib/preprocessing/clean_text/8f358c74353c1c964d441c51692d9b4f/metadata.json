It will create it with solar panels and a technology that capitalizes on moisture in the air.\\nThe company\u2019s tag line is \u2018drinking water democratized,\u2019 and it certainly seems to stand for the exact opposite world view of, say, Nestle , which has been stealing water from people and San Bernardino National Forest reserves and then selling it back to people in plastic water bottles. Zero Mass Water can deliver clean water to people in the poorest nations, with no need for piping or complicated water plants. The solar panel itself is smaller than a traditional air conditioner and can be placed in remote areas with ease.\\nThe United Nations claims that more than 783 million people currently lack clean drinking water and more than 6 million people die annually from water-borne disease. They also claim that, with population growth, we can expect a 50 percent increase in water demand; but they haven\u2019t accounted for simple technologies which can make use of millions of gallons of water using clean, sustainable, and even simple technologies. The demand for water could also easily be met by practicing better water harvesting, catchment, and filtering.\\nZero Mass Water joins other breakthrough technologies like the \u201cDrinkable Book\u201d and experimental wastewater filters , which are trying to bring water to every corner of the world.\\nA blog post from Duke Energy, a partner in Zero Mass\u2019s project claims the water purification system doesn\u2019t need an outside source of energy, so it can be placed were infrastructure is damaged or non-existent.\\nAt a recent installation in the coastal city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, a medical clinic was able to enjoy clean water for the first time without having to haul it in with trucks \u2014 an expensive endeavor. Though it rains frequently in Ecuador, there is little potable water .\\nThe project has targeted an even larger area for humanitarian aid \u2014 water-generating solar panels are being placed in Jordan. The company claims the panels will help Syrian refugees in the country, possibly aiding 200,000 people, who currently have no access to clean drinking water.\\nIf Zero Mass Water is successful in a war-torn area, their solar panels might also be perfect for the 5,300 cities across the U.S. who have been drinking lead-contaminated water due to crumbling infrastructure and a political elite who have been unwilling to replace old pipes with new ones, along with expensive water filters on municipal supplies.\\nWhen the sun can bring you energy, and drinking water, there is little need for poverty, ill-health, and reliance upon aging government and corporate structures . This invention truly could democratize water for the planet.\\nThis article ( These New Solar Panels Use Sunlight to Create Clean Drinking Water from the Air ) is free and open source.
