Like Debbie Wasserman Schultz before her, Brazile has lost credibility as an honest broker at the Democratic National Committee. The DNC chair should be evenhanded \u2014 but, thanks to leaked emails , Brazile\u2019s cover is blown. \\nAt the same time that Brazile was publicly claiming to be neutral in the fierce Clinton-Sanders primary battle, she was using her job as a CNN political analyst to give the Clinton campaign advance notice of questions that would be asked during a CNN debate between the two candidates. Donna Brazile, interim Democratic Party chairperson. \\nYet Brazile seems tone deaf about her integrity breach \u2014 just as the Democratic Party establishment has been tone deaf about the corrosive effects of servicing Wall Street and wealthy contributors. \\nAs the Washington Post reported a week ago , \u201cDonna Brazile is not apologizing for leaking CNN debate questions and topics to the Hillary Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary. Her only regret, it seems, is that she got caught.\u201d \\nConsider Brazile\u2019s response after the email hack exposed the chasm between her public claims of being evenhanded and her furtive effort to help Clinton gain an improper debate advantage over Sanders. \u201cMy conscience, as an activist, as a strategist \u2014 my conscience is very clear,\u201d Brazile said in a radio interview , adding that \u201cif I had to do it all over again, I would know a hell of a lot more about cybersecurity.\u201d \\nBut the current DNC chair\u2019s lack of encryption knowledge is hardly the problem. Brazile has functioned as a shameless cog in the Clinton political machine. That machine hasn\u2019t just broken down; it is now kaput. \\nIn the wake of Donald Trump \u2019s victory, the DNC must undergo a far-reaching shakeup. And \u2014 with no time to waste \u2014 we can\u2019t wait several months until Brazile\u2019s planned departure from the DNC chair job in March. \\nThat\u2019s why several hundred activists who were Bernie Sanders delegates to the Democratic National Convention just voted to \u201ccall for the immediate resignation of Donna Brazile as chair of the Democratic National Committee.\u201d \\nA lopsided tally came in over the weekend, with 96 percent \u2014 337 to 13 \u2014 in favor of pushing for Brazile to resign. The straw poll was conducted by the Bernie Delegates Network (which I coordinate), an independent group sponsored by the online activist organization RootsAction.org in partnership with Progressive Democrats of America. \\n\u201cThe DNC must either change or it will die,\u201d says PDA executive director Donna Smith. \u201cAnd that change starts with Ms. Brazile\u2019s prompt resignation.\u201d \\nRootsAction has launched a nationwide petition campaign calling for Brazile to resign immediately. \\nA Symbol and Symptom \\nBrazile\u2019s duplicitous behavior is a symbol and symptom of the Democratic Party leadership \u2014 which remains unwilling to admit that its chronic alignment with Wall Street, big banks and harmful trade deals has been key to sagging electoral fortunes.

That claim has now been thoroughly discredited, as election returns from the Rust Belt attest. \\nThe old guard at the DNC should not be allowed to hang on. Despite all the pseudo-populist gestures, Donna Brazile and her Clinton Inc. allies can be expected to do little more than tinker with corporate-fueled DNC machinery that is long overdue for the junk heap. \\nThe Democratic National Committee is now a relic of mechanisms spinning toward oligarchy. Every day that goes by with the old leadership in place is a day wasted for the essential work to come. \\nNorman Solomon was a Sanders delegate from California to the Democratic National Convention.
