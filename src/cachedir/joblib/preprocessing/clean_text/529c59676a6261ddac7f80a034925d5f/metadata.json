All the fires have gone out, there are icicles hanging from the ceiling and even the Great Lake of Pitch has started to freeze over. I\u2019m wearing two jumpers and some bed socks but I\u2019m still chilled to the bone. I think there is something seriously wrong with the Satanic thermostat \u2013 what\u2019s going on up there on Earth? Lucifer Hell Dear Lucifer, Everyone knows girls can\u2019t be President of America. Girls are supposed to be Princesses. They don\u2019t do boring mannish stuff like run a country wearing ugly suits. Princesses spend their time brushing their long golden hair, singing pretty songs and talking to woodland creatures. Once in a while we\u2019re allowed to do empowering stuff like turn the kingdom to ice and tell everyone to get lost, but most of the time we\u2019re just hanging about waiting for the goofy handsome prince to turn up. Hope that helps,\""}, "time": 1742562032.6168532}
