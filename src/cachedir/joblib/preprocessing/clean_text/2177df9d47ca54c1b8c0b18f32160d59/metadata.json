A United States military plane on Monday delivered most of the 330 Marines to a garrison in Vaernes, in central Norway, a deployment that Norwegian officials said had been carried out by the United States as part of a bilateral agreement. It was the latest effort by the United States and its European allies to buttress their defenses against a resurgent Russia, which condemned the move. Despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum, the arrival of the Marines from Camp Lejeune, N. C.  \u2014   shown on Norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow  \u2014   also provoked some jitters in Norway. A wealthy   country that is a member of NATO but not the European Union, the Nordic state has long prided itself on its independence. But the deployment recalled a Cold War era in which Russian intrigue grabbed headlines and Norwegians lived in fear of Soviet hegemony. Neuroses about Russia continue to exert influence in Norwegian popular culture. The political television thriller \u201cOkkupert\u201d depicts a future in which Norway is occupied by Russia, and with the backing of the European Union, takes over the country\u2019s oil production. Such fears have been magnified in recent years with murky sightings of submarines across the region that have stoked concern about Russian espionage and military intervention. In October 2014, an unidentified vessel spotted off the Stockholm archipelago spurred Sweden\u2019s largest mobilization since the Cold War and accusations that Russia was spying on the country. The episode, called \u201cThe Hunt for Reds in October\u201d in the Swedish news media, included unsubstantiated reports of a man in black spotted wading near the vessel. It deeply unsettled the nation, even as the Kremlin issued strenuous denials and accused Stockholm of scaremongering. Then, in April 2015, the sudden appearance of an underwater vessel in Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, prompted the navy to fire depth charges  \u2014   the first such warning in more than 10 years. And Lithuania on Monday said it plans to use European Union funding to build a fence on the border with Russia\u2019s highly militarised Kaliningrad exclave to increase security and prevent smuggling, according to Agence  . Construction of the   $32 million fence will start this spring and will be finished by the end of the year, said Interior Minister Eimutis Misiunas. \u201cThe reasons are both economic to prevent smuggling and geopolitical to strengthen the E. U.\u2019s external border,\u201d Mr. Misiunas said. \u201cIt would not stop tanks but it will be difficult to climb over. \u201d In Moscow, the deployment of United States Marines in Norway has been met with disdain. After plans for the deployment were confirmed in October, Frants Klintsevich, a deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s defense and security committee in the upper chamber of Parliament, was quoted by Russian news media as saying that the Kremlin viewed the Marines as a direct military threat. He also said the deployment made Norway a potential target for Moscow\u2019s powerful arsenal, which includes nuclear weapons. On Monday, the Russian authorities reiterated their discontent. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said in an interview with NRK, the Norwegian public broadcaster, that the move \u201ccertainly will not improve relations. \u201d \u201cThe relationship between Norway and Russia is put to a test now,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of developing economic cooperation, Norway is choosing to deploy United States troops on Norwegian soil. \u201d The deployment of the Marines, who will be stationed hundreds of miles from the border with Russia, comes as countries across Europe have been reinforcing their defenses out of concern over an increasingly assertive Russia. Last week, a convoy from an American armored brigade crossed the German border into Poland, the first installment of what are expected to be several thousand NATO troops to be based across Eastern Europe. Relations between the West and Russia in the Nordic region and beyond have been tense since that country\u2019s annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the outbreak of conflict between government forces and   rebels in eastern Ukraine. At the same time,   Donald J. Trump fanned alarm in Europe in the months leading to his election victory when he questioned whether the United States should automatically defend NATO allies if they were attacked, and predicated American support on the willingness of countries in the alliance to pay their fair share for military protection. In Norway, some lamented that the Marines\u2019 arrival stood against the country\u2019s traditions and threatened to make it a target of its much larger neighbor. Morten Harper, a leftist member of the local assembly that governs the area housing the military base, said the Marines\u2019 arrival was ensnaring Norway into the United States\u2019 \u201cpower struggle\u201d with Russia. \u201cWe see an ever more tense foreign policy situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there ever was to be a major conflict between the great powers in the future, this makes us a more likely bomb target. \u201d After World War II, Norway abandoned its neutral stance by joining NATO in 1949 and committing to the alliance\u2019s doctrine of collective defense. But the country, which shares a   northern border with Russia, sought to placate Moscow by pledging that no foreign troops would be allowed to be permanently stationed on its soil. Norway\u2019s defense minister, Ine Eriksen Soreide, said in an interview on Sunday that Russia had no reason to be alarmed by the Marines\u2019 presence. She said that the deployment did not flout the     restriction because the Marines were there on a   trial period that was  . The Marines will take part in military exercises, involving skiing and surviving in Arctic temperatures, to hone their abilities to fight in tough winter conditions. It is part of a bilateral agreement between Oslo and Washington, but Norwegian officials said that, in the case of a conflict, the troops would probably fall under NATO\u2019s command. Hedda B. Langemyr of the Norwegian Peace Council, a group made up of several nongovernmental organizations, said the deployment threatened to aggravate tension between Norway and Russia while breaching Norway\u2019s tradition of not allowing permanent foreign troops on its soil. \u201cIt might give the hawks in Moscow arguments for a continued arms race,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742563197.104521}
