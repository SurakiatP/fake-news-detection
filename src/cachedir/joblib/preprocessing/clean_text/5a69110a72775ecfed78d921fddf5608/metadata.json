Plots have been disrupted. Terrorists have been taken off the battlefield. And we\u2019ve done this even as we\u2019ve drawn down nearly 180, 000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201d The speech was intended as a valedictory answer to years of criticism from conservatives that Mr. Obama\u2019s break with many of President George W. Bush\u2019s policies  \u2014   ending the torture of terrorism suspects and withdrawing most American ground forces from Afghanistan and Iraq  \u2014   had left the country vulnerable. And many liberals have complained that Mr. Obama had betrayed his 2008 campaign supporters by acting too much like Mr. Bush in continuing and even expanding some policies, such as targeted killings using drones. Mr. Obama gave the speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. home to the military\u2019s Central Command and Special Operations Command, both of which have been crucial to his fight against terrorism and efforts to wind down the wars fought since Sept. 11, 2001. He stood before a crowd of about 2, 500 men and women mostly in uniform and presented himself as the most   president in the country\u2019s history. \u201cOn January 20th, I will become the first president of the United States to serve two full terms during a time of war,\u201d he said. He defended an approach to fighting wars that did not bankrupt the Treasury or cause thousands of deaths. He noted, for instance, that he has spent $10 billion over the last two years fighting the Islamic State  \u2014   the same amount of money President George W. Bush spent in just one month fighting the Iraq War. And he laid out a series of principles: keep the terrorist threat in perspective, avoid military overreach, adhere to the rule of law, use restraint when carrying out strikes to minimize repercussions, be open with the public, use diplomacy and protect civil liberties. While Mr. Obama had been planning the speech for months, Donald J. Trump\u2019s election victory made the address all the more vital for him. The president sought to defend his legacy and provide a road map for a successor with no experience in national security  \u2014   and warn Mr. Trump away from some of his more controversial positions and advisers. Mr. Trump has, on occasion, advocated the use of torture and questioned the value of NATO and other alliances, although he has since modulated those positions. \u201cFirst of all, a sustainable counterterrorism strategy depends on keeping the threat in perspective,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The fighters of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda are not the worry some claim they are, he said. \u201cThey are thugs and they are murderers and they should be treated that way,\u201d Mr. Obama said. And while defending the use of wartime powers to fight terrorists  \u2014   something many liberals reject  \u2014   he also emphasized the importance of sometimes relying on law enforcement powers that the Bush administration explicitly rejected as a response to a threat. For example, Mr. Obama argued that it had proved more effective to prosecute terrorism suspects in civilian courts than military commissions. For a historic comparison, Mr. Obama pointed out that fascism threatened to overrun the globe during World War II, and the Soviet Union threatened a nuclear holocaust during the Cold War. \u201cToday\u2019s terrorists can kill innocent people, but they don\u2019t pose an existential threat to our nation and we cannot make the mistake of elevating them as if they do,\u201d he said, because exaggerating their powers helps bring them enhanced credibility among their followers and potential followers. \u201cThese terrorists can never directly destroy our way of life but we can do it for them if we lose track of who we are and the values that this nation was founded on,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump has proposed banning immigration from Muslim countries, and some Republicans have proposed scrutiny of Muslim communities in the United States. Mr. Obama criticized such proposals. Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, has emphasized the threat represented by Islamic extremism, which he said is spreading. \u201cProtecting liberty? That\u2019s something we do for all Americans, not just some,\u201d Mr. Obama said. And while the Islamic State and Al Qaeda claim to be fighting on behalf of Islam, he said they do not speak for Muslims everywhere, including the United States. \u201cIf we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we\u2019re not just going to lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we\u2019re also going lose the very principles we claim to defend,\u201d he said. Mr. Obama also expressed frustrations with Congress, reiterating his criticism that lawmakers did not act on his request to enact a new and limited war authorization to battle the Islamic State. He also complained that Congress did not lift legal restrictions that prevented him from closing the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison, which he called \u201ca blot on our national honor. \u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s speech drew criticism from Republicans, including his 2008 presidential campaign opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s speech was nothing more than a feeble attempt to evade the harsh judgment of history,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cBut to the American people, our emboldened enemies, and our dispirited allies, his legacy on counterterrorism is unmistakably clear: a disastrous withdrawal from Iraq, the terrorist rampage of ISIL, an indecisive approach to the war in Afghanistan that has empowered the Taliban, and an indifferent approach to the carnage in Syria on which our terrorist enemies have thrived. No rhetorical conceit will alter history\u2019s verdict. \u201d His speech was interrupted by raucous applause on several occasions, including when he said that one of his core convictions as commander in chief was \u201cthat we are and must remain the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. \u201d Mr. Obama acknowledged that the situation in Afghanistan is not perfect, but that the fight is now almost entirely being waged by Afghan forces, not by Americans. He also acknowledged that there have been a series of domestic terrorist attacks during his presidency that were \u201ccarried out by homegrown and largely isolated individuals who were radicalized online. \u201d But while such   attacks  \u2014   he cited the Boston Marathon bombing and shooting sprees at Fort Hood, Tex. San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. \u2014   cause \u201cpain,\u201d he said, they cannot inflict the kind of mass casualties that the   attackers managed. Mr. Obama\u2019s choice of MacDill Air Force Base to deliver the speech was symbolic, because much of his antiterrorism strategy, including the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, relied on Special Operations forces. Such troops can be used in small raids in ways that do not attract the opposition and attacks that large bodies of forces would.'"}, "time": 1742564276.5326355}
