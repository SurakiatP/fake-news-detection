[From the New York Times:  One night in September 2014, when he was chief executive of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon hosted cocktails and dinner at the Washington townhouse where he lived, a mansion near the Supreme Court that he liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. Beneath elaborate chandeliers and flanked by gold drapes and stately oil paintings, Jeff Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, sat next to the guest of honor: Nigel Farage, the insurgent British politician, who first met Sessions two years earlier when Bannon introduced them. Farage was building support for his   party by complaining in the British press about \u201cuncontrolled mass immigration. \u201d Sessions, like other attendees, was celebrating the recent collapse in Congress of bipartisan immigration reform, which would have provided a path to citizenship for some undocumented people. At the dinner, Sessions told a writer for Vice, Reid Cherlin, that Bannon\u2019s site was instrumental in defeating the measure. Sessions read Breitbart almost every day, he explained, because it was \u201cputting out   information. \u201d Bannon\u2019s role in blocking the reform had gone beyond sympathetic coverage on his site. Over the previous year, he, Sessions and one of Sessions\u2019s top aides, Stephen Miller, spent \u201can enormous amount of time\u201d meeting in person, \u201cdeveloping plans and messaging and strategy,\u201d as Miller later explained to Rosie Gray in The Atlantic. Breitbart writers also reportedly met with Sessions\u2019s staff for a weekly happy hour at the Union Pub. For most Republicans in Washington, immigration was an issue they wished would go away, a persistent source of conflict between the party\u2019s elites, who saw it as a straightforward economic good, and its   voting base, who mistrusted the effects of immigration on employment. But for Bannon, Sessions and Miller, immigration was a galvanizing issue, lying at the center of their apparent vision for reshaping the United States by tethering it to its European and Christian origins. (None of them would comment for this article.) That September evening, as they celebrated the collapse of the reform effort  \u2014   and the rise of Farage, whose own   party in Britain represented the new brand of nativism  \u2014   it felt like the beginning of something new. \u201cI was privileged enough to be at it,\u201d Miller said about the gathering last June, while a guest on Breitbart\u2019s SiriusXM radio show. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound like a motivational speech, but it\u2019s true. To all the voters out there: The only limits to what we can achieve is what we believe we can achieve. \u201d The answer to what they could achieve, of course, is now obvious: everything. Bannon and Miller are ensconced in the West Wing, as arguably the two most influential policy advisers to Donald J. Trump. And Jeff Sessions is now the attorney general of the United States. The genesis of their working relationship is crucial to understanding the   domestic goals of the Trump presidency and how the law may be used to attain them over the next four years. Bannon and Sessions have effectively presented the country\u2019s changing demographics  \u2014   the rising number of minority and   residents  \u2014   as America\u2019s chief internal threat. Sessions has long been an outlier in his party on this subject in 2013, when his Republican colleagues were talking primarily about curbing illegal immigration, he offered a proposal to curb legal immigration. (It failed in committee, 17 to one.) Read the rest here. '"}, "time": 1742563362.52139}
