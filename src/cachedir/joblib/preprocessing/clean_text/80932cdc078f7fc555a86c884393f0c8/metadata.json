The officer reported that he told Luckhurst to go back and throw it away. The officer said he saw Luckhurst go back and he assumed that Luckhurst discarded the container\u201d said the San Antonio Police Department in a statement. \\nLuckhurst was immediately fired, but is appealing his suspension, saying it was just a \u201cjoke\u201d that went too far. \\nWe applaud the San Antonio Police Department for doing the right thing and immediately firing this man, who is a disgrace to his badge. Despite America\u2019s persistent refusal to recognize them as such, the homeless are people who deserve to be treated with the same dignity that every human deserves. \\nThe homeless are the victims of an uncaring society ruled by cutthroat capitalism, a waste of human potential and a representation of all our sins. For them to be abused by those sworn to protect just goes to show how law enforcement in the United States treat our citizens like occupiers and not as guardians.'"}, "time": 1742563668.7174222}
