So he protested all the way up the country\u2019s chain of command. In a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country\u2019s autocratic ruler, the United Nations official, Juan E. M\u00e9ndez, was again denied, this time with a jeering dismissal. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go to Guant\u00e1namo instead,\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Mendez, a former United Nations special rapporteur on torture. In Bahrain, officials were a little more subtle, but the message was the same, as they twice canceled prison inspection visits. \u201cThey said we face the same threats to national security as other countries face,\u201d Mr. Mendez said. \u201cIt was clear they were referring to the United States, and they didn\u2019t feel that they needed to give me access. \u201d Now, after   Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign vows to reinstate the sort of torture used in the   war on terrorism  \u2014   and to fill the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison with \u201csome bad dudes\u201d  \u2014   human rights experts fear that authoritarian regimes around the world will see it as another green light to carry out their own abuses. A return to such \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d  \u2014   and even to techniques that Mr. Trump has pledged will be \u201cmuch worse\u201d  \u2014   would also send a powerful message just as nations around the world have begun to examine their own past abuses to ensure that they will not be repeated. \u201cSometimes we see progress, and then we see \u201d said Victor   the   of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, a   umbrella organization for   groups. \u201cWhen the U. S. was engaging in torture, that created an enormous   of the pendulum,\u201d he added. \u201cThere were a lot of officials in other countries during the Bush administration who were saying, \u2018The Americans are doing it, so why can\u2019t we?\u2019 Now, with Trump saying, \u2018I will bring a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\u2019 you can imagine how far we could go backwards. \u201d Nils Melzer, who succeeded Mr. Mendez as the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on torture in November, warned that if the Trump administration revived the use of torture, the consequences around the world \u201cwould be catastrophic. \u201d A fragile consensus against torture, said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the regional director for the Americas for Human Rights Watch, could be shattered \u201cwhen you have the White House openly advocating for torture. \u201d During the campaign, Mr. Trump declared that \u201ctorture works,\u201d and he vowed to \u201cimmediately\u201d reinstate techniques like waterboarding because \u201cwe have to beat the savages\u201d of the Islamic State, who \u201cdeserve\u201d such treatment even if it is fruitless. Since the election, Mr. Trump has indicated that he might be reconsidering his position, citing the firm stance against torture by James N. Mattis, his Pentagon nominee. In an interview with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump said that he was \u201csurprised\u201d when Mr. Mattis told him that he opposed torture and instead favored more humane interrogations of prisoners based on rapport building. But Mr. Trump did not close the door entirely. If Americans feel strongly about bringing back waterboarding and other tactics, he said, \u201cI would be guided by that. \u201d Nora Sveaass, a psychologist at the University of Oslo and a former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture, warned that if Mr. Trump revived the use of torture by the United States, it would have a ripple effect around the globe. \u201cThe U. S. is a very strong voice,\u201d Ms. Sveaass said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like putting a bomb into all of those major principles  \u2014   the absolute prohibition on torture the absolute obligation to provide redress and justice to victims of torture, including rehabilitation the obligation to investigate and hold people to account,\u201d she added. \u201cIf one country such as the U. S. openly torpedoes those principles, you can just forget about asking for compliance from states already challenging the absolute prohibition. \u201d The signal from Mr. Trump that torture is acceptable again comes just as countries from Argentina to Tunisia, either through courts or special truth commissions, are engaged in tentative efforts to hold themselves accountable for past conduct. In Argentina, Omar Graffigna, the    former chief of the country\u2019s air force, was sentenced to prison in September for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two   activists, Patricia Roisinblit and Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Rojo. The prosecution of Mr. Graffigna was just one in a series of old cases that have been brought into the courts this year in Argentina, as the nation comes to grips with the legacy of its \u201cdirty war\u201d of the 1970s and early 1980s. In Tunisia, a new Truth and Dignity Commission held its first hearings in November, allowing torture victims to tell their harrowing stories before a national television audience. The commission was created to investigate torture and other human rights violations dating to 1955, primarily by the regime of President Zine   Ben Ali, who was deposed during the Arab Spring in 2011. And in December, Bolivia\u2019s legislature voted to create a truth commission to investigate torture, murders and other crimes committed by a series of authoritarian regimes from 1964 to 1982. Even in countries that have not conducted such   investigations, new     organizations have begun to take root, and those groups are trying to make it more difficult for their governments to continue to engage in torture with secrecy and impunity. Samuel Herbert Nsubuga, the chief executive of the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, based in Uganda, said   legislation that the country passed in 2012 had still not been put into effect. When the law finally takes effect, \u201cour challenge will be to bring some people to trial in Uganda for torture,\u201d he said. In the meantime, his group has enlisted doctors and psychologists to provide medical help and therapy to torture victims, as well as lawyers to provide legal advice. But the moves toward examining past abuses are so far limited to relatively small nations or countries where the focus is on historical events rather than the current use of torture. The inquiries are also often being conducted in the face of strong resistance from top government officials, who oppose aggressive investigations even of past crimes. Those modest efforts could face sharp setbacks if Mr. Trump brings back banned practices. \u201cI am afraid that Trump\u2019s government will question the basic values of the international order, and torturing people will be justified,\u201d said Carlos Jibaja, a psychologist with CAPS, a group in Lima, Peru, that helps victims of torture. At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s advocacy of torture may encourage some major countries, like Russia and the Philippines, to be even more open and aggressive in their use of torture. Olga Sadovskaya, the vice chairwoman of the Committee Against Torture, a human rights group in Russia, said that torture was already common in the country. She noted that Russian prison and police officials routinely used torture tactics with cruel nicknames, such as the \u201cPresident Putin,\u201d which involves attaching wires from an office telephone to a victim\u2019s body and then running electric current through it. The police like that tactic, she said, because it does not leave marks. Edeliza Hernandez, the executive director of the Medical Action Group in the Philippines, an organization that documents cases of torture and provides treatment and rehabilitation, estimated that there were 200 political prisoners in detention centers in the country, and said that most of them had been tortured. \u201cThe government has soldiers watch us while we inspect prisoners,\u201d she said. Mr. Melzer, the United Nations official, warned that if Mr. Trump followed through on his pledges, more countries would follow his lead and get back into the torture business. \u201cWhat kind of message would that be to the world?\u201d Mr. Melzer asked. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be worse. What happens to the role of the United States as an example in the world, and what would that mean for the policies of other states? If the United States does it, those other countries will know they can get away with it. The last thing the world needs is a U. S. president legitimizing this. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562188.2934394}
