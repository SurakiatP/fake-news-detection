[On Thursday, the State Department released 371 emails from the batch of about 15, 000 that were reportedly uncovered during an FBI investigation of Clinton\u2019s server.  Among the newly released correspondence was a message about Clinton\u2019s yoga, with the email in question also involving the transmission of a secure document.  The message citing yoga, dated February 12, 2010, was sent to Clinton by her top aide Huma Abedin. Typed in lower case letters, the email stated: \u201ci am going to have the secure document from jake faxed to the house while you do yoga. also, i am getting (redacted) tomorrow in case we land sunday and have to go straight to work right now she is coming at 1 pm. \u201d Clinton responded, \u201cOk. Pls have secure stuff faxed to justin. \u201d \u201cYes, I connected with him,\u201d Abedin replied. Below is a screenshot grab of the email: Clinton was known to have had a secure fax machine at her house. The newly released email was not necessarily deleted by Clinton. The Hill reported on the most recent batch of released emails from the 15, 000 uncovered by the FBI: Many of the documents  \u2014   consisting of about 1, 031 pages  \u2014   are \u201cnear duplicates\u201d of documents Clinton provided to the State Department in 2014 and have already been made public, according to the agency.   \u2026    Clinton deleted about 30, 000 emails from the private server she used while secretary of State, saying they were not   before turning over thousands more to the government. But during its examination, the FBI recovered some additional emails that could be relevant to the FOIA lawsuit. A preliminary review of the 15, 000 emails revealed that about 60 percent were of a purely personal nature. Around 37 percent  \u2014   or 5, 600 documents  \u2014   were deemed   but of those, a \u201csubstantial number\u201d were exact duplicates of the 30, 000 emails that Clinton turned over to the agency in December 2014, according to State Department lawyers. This is not the first Clinton email to be made public that involves yoga. A September 3, 2009 email posted on WikiLeaks was titled \u201cYoga\u201d and contained a list of times  \u2014    seemingly for yoga classes.
