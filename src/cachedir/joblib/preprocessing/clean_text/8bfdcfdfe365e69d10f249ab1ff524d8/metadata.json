Justice officials didn\u2019t sign off on Comey\u2019s decision and he didn\u2019t seek their approval, one official said. \\nInstead, he made an independent decision to go against longstanding Justice Department and FBI practice to not comment publicly about politically sensitive investigations within 60 days of an election, the official said. \\nComey later explained his decision to provide Congress with the information in a letter to FBI employees. \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,\u201d Comey said. \u201cI also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\u201d \\nClinton\u2019s campaign and allies quickly decried the decision\u2019s timing, and the candidate herself on Friday forcefully called on the FBI to release the \u201cfull and complete facts\u201d about its review. \\n\u201cVoting is underway, so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\u201d Clinton said at a brief news conference in Des Moines, Iowa, adding it was \u201cimperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay.\u201d \\nClinton said she was \u201cconfident whatever (the emails) are will not change the conclusion reached in July,\u201d when Comey said he wouldn\u2019t recommend criminal charges in the matter. \\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump, who has spent the past several weeks on defense, seized on the issue. \\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d \\nHe later responded to Clinton\u2019s statement, saying she \u201ctried to politicize the investigation by attacking and falsely accusing the FBI director of only sending the letter to Republicans.\u201d \\nIn a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen Friday, Comey said investigators are examining newly discovered emails that \u201cappear to be pertinent\u201d to the email probe. \\n\u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,\u201d Comey wrote the chairmen. \u201cI am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742562084.7729917}
