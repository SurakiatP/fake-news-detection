[cheers]. \\nThe Democrat establishment was warned about their weak candidate, and they were presented with a popular and well-funded alternative: Bernie Sanders. Instead, as the Podesta emails show in lavish detail, they used their control of the party machinery and their service providers in our famously free press to rig the election in their favor at every turn. When their candidate was nominated, the Democrat establishment tacked right, and proceeded to explain to Sanders voters that their voters were not needed because, as #BernieBros, they were racist and sexist. Sanders supporters have every right to say #WeWereRight and #WeToldYouSo. \\nIf this were Japan, we\u2019d be seeing Democrat Party leaders committing seppuku, or cutting off their little fingers or \u2014 supposing them not to be gangsters \u2014 ritually and tearfully bowing to the people they betrayed. This being America, and these being Democrats, they are feverishly deploying the Blame Cannons at racist and sexist #BernieBros, Johnson, Stein, and the dogs who wouldn\u2019t eat the dog food. These assclowns will only leave office if they\u2019re whipped with scorpions. So get to it, Sanders supporters. This is your time. \\nStats Watch \\nMBA Mortgage Applications, week of November 4, 2016: \u201cPurchase applications for home mortgages rose a seasonally adjusted 1 percent in the November 4 week as activity by home buyers stabilizes following a decline to the lowest level since January in the previous weeks\u201d [ Econoday ]. \\nWholesale Trade, September 2016: \u201cInventories at the wholesale level rose 0.1 percent in September vs a revised 0.1 percent decline in August: [ Econoday ]. \u201cIn a special positive, wholesale inventories of autos fell 1.7 percent in a draw, based on last week\u2019s very strong results for October vehicle sales, that will have to be rebuilt. The risk that inventories may be too high are a key concern for the economic outlook, specifically that high levels of unwanted inventories could slow fourth-quarter production and employment growth.\u201d \\nWages: \u201cThe Atlanta Fed\u2019s Wage Growth Tracker came in at 3.6 percent in September, up from 3.3 percent in August and 3.4 percent in July, but the same as the 3.6 percent reading for June. By this measure, there are no obvious signs of an acceleration in wage growth for continuously employed workers during the last few months\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \u201cHowever, the headline wage growth tracker is a three month moving average of each month\u2019s median wage growth. Interestingly, for September, the median wage growth (using data that are not averaged, sometimes called \u201cunsmoothed\u201d) was 4.2 percent, up from 3.6 percent in August, and the highest since late 2007.\u201d \\nReal Estate: \u201cLeading Index for Commercial Real Estate \u201cmoves higher\u201d in October\u201d [ Calculated Risk ]. \u201d According to Dodge, this index leads \u201cconstruction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year\u201d. In general, this suggests further increases in CRE spending over the next year.\u201d \\nRetail: \u201cWith the US holiday shopping season now in full swing, the latest monthly Global Port Tracker report produced by the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates predicted major US retail ports would handle 4.4% more imports this month than a year earlier. And volumes are expected to show a 4.5% year-on-year gain in December\u201d [ Lloyd\u2019s Loading List ]. That\u2019s the retailers story and they\u2019re sticking to it. \\nShipping: \u201cThe number of idle containerships has reached yet new highs, even with the current acceleration of vessels heading to the breakers. According to the latest survey conducted by Alphaliner, there were as many as 397 ships above 500 teu awaiting employment on October 31\u201d [ Lloyd\u2019s List ]. \\nShipping: \u201cWho needs a warehouse when you have a printer?\u201d [ DC Velocity ]. \u201cWill demand for warehouse space shrink as manufacturers print the parts they need on demand instead of making them ahead of time and storing them in DCs? Will express parcel carriers see a drop in business as shippers e-mail digital designs instead of mailing physical parts? Or will 3-D printing be reserved mainly for filling niche demand for prototypes and replacement parts (the approach taken by a New Zealand airline that prints out replacement tray tables)?\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cThe American Trucking Associations, the largest group representing trucking companies in Washington, said Wednesday it has already started meeting with the Donald Trump transition team as the industry prepares for a possible new look at regulations due to hit operators next year\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cTrucking Group Starts Meeting With Donald Trump\u2019s Transition Team\u201d]. \u201cTrucking companies are preparing to meet a Dec. 31, 2017 deadline to equip all trucks with electronic logging devices measuring their hours on the road. The rule has divided segments of the industry, with smaller truckers complaining about the cost and shipping customers arguing that it will drive some companies out of business and leave bigger operators free to raise prices.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cAirlines for America (A4A) has welcomed Donald Trump as US President-elect and said that it looks forward to collaborating with his Transition Team on \u2018modernising the infrastructure of the skies to meet the needs of a growing US economy'\u201d [ Air Cargo News ]. They want to reform the Air Traffic Control system\u2026 \\nHoney for the Bears: \u201cThe growth in U.S. imports of goods has been stubbornly low since the second quarter of 2015, with an average annual growth rate of 0.7 percent. Growth has been even weaker for non-oil imports, which have increased at an average annual rate of only 0.1 percent. This is in sharp contrast to the pattern in the five quarters preceding the second quarter of 2015, when real non-oil imports were growing at an annualized rate of 8 percent per quarter\u201d [ Liberty Stree t]. \u201cHow has the recent slowdown in U.S. investment affected U.S. imports? The next chart shows that U.S. capital goods imports are very highly correlated with equipment investment\u2014a category that excludes intangibles, residential investment, and changes in inventories. Equipment investment has been unusually weak, with its four-quarter percentage change falling into negative territory, which is unusual outside a recession period. These data suggest that the slowdown in import growth likely stems from whatever is behind the weakness in equipment, rather than from trade-specific factors such as trade policies or higher trade costs.\u201d Well, we do have a capitalist economy\u2026 \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cTrump\u2019s victory in the US presidential race adds an exclamation mark to the concerns over anti-globalisation and protectionism expressed by the shipping industry in Copenhagen at the end of October, Norden chief executive Jan Rindbo told Lloyd\u2019s List on Wednesday\u201d [ Lloyd\u2019s List ]. Globalization has been weakening for some time. It\u2019s not just Trump. \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cIt really does now look like President Donald J. Trump, and markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover? If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never\u201d [Paul Krugman, New York Times ]. Sure, \u201cfirst pass\u201d is faux Nobel-worthy weasel wording. But come on. \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cDow Makes Miraculous 1,000 Point Recovery From Trump-Fueled Overnight Lows\u201d [ ETF.com ]. \u201cThe most short-lived major market crash of all time ended as quickly as currency manipulator\u201d [ Politico ]. \u201cEven if congressional Republicans demonstrated the will and actually managed to approve the TPP in the lame-duck session that begins Monday, the chances of which appear next to nil with Trump headed to the White House, the president-elect would not implement the 12-nation pact, University of California-Irvine Professor Peter Navarro, a Trump adviser, told Politico in August. That makes the Trump presidency the worst-case scenario for the Obama administration and other trade proponents who have been clinging to the hope that the Asia-Pacific pact could pass before the end of this year.\u201d Sad! \\n\u201c\u2018I think the TPP is dead, and there will be blood all over the floor if somebody tries to move that through the Congress any time soon,\u2019 Sessions said. \u2018Both candidates opposed it, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump'\u201d [ Observer ]. \\n2016 \\nThe Rending of Garments and Gnashing of Teeth \\n\u201cAn American Tragedy\u201d [David Remnik, The New Yorker (2:40AM). \u201cThat the electorate has, in its plurality, decided to live in Trump\u2019s world of vanity, hate, arrogance, untruth, and recklessness, his disdain for democratic norms, is a fact that will lead, inevitably, to all manner of national decline and suffering.\u201d Notice the flaccidity of the language: \u201cdemocratic norms\u201d; \u201call manner of\u201d; \u201ca fact\u2026 that will lead to.\u201d Remnik really needs an editor. Sad. \\n\u201cHomeless in America\u201d [Thomas Friedman, New York Times ]. \u201cHow do I explain Trump\u2019s victory? Way too soon to say for sure, but my gut tells me that it has much less to do with trade or income gaps and much more to do with culture and many Americans\u2019 feeling of \u201chomelessness.'\u201d And then Friedman spirals off into abstractions about the \u201cfeelings\u201d people have when they lose their homes, while somehow omitting to mention the fact that millions of Americans literally lost their homes in a foreclosure crisis caused by scamming banksters Obama never brought to justice, and who, if they were foolish enough to enter Obama\u2019s \u201cfoam the runway\u201d HAMP program, were further screwed. \\n\u201cAmericans are not and have never been united by blood or creed, but by allegiance to a democratic system of government that shares power, cherishes the rule of law and respects the dignity of individuals. We hope our newly elected president will show respect for that system. Americans must stand ready to support him if he does, and to support the system whether he does or does not\u201d [Editorial Board, WaPo ]. Would that any of those things were true. Perhaps for the individuals on WaPo\u2019s editorial board, they are. \\n\u201cPolitical scientists have long recognized that most ordinary citizens have only a tenuous grasp of \u2018the presuppositions and complex obligations of democracy, the rights it grants and the self-restraints it imposes.\u2019 Thus, political elites \u2018serve as the major repositories of the public conscience,\u2019 if anyone does\u201d [Larry Bartels, New York Times ]. I\u2019ve always wondered why the Democrats never really work to extent the franchise. Here at least we have the ideological justification. \\n\u201cToday the world has seen the end of two centuries of Anglo-Saxon dominance \u2013 a hundred years of Britain, from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 to the Battle of the Somme, and a hundred years of the United States, ending today, with the election as president of the US of a fascist \u2018television personality\u2019 married to a nude model\u201d [ Splash 247 ]. \u201c\u2018Decadence\u2019 is the term that we need, here \u2013 decadence on a scale not seen in the world since the fall of the Roman Empire \u2013 which fell in much the same way, for much the same reasons.\u201d \\nWe have now seen a hat trick of \u2018democratic\u2019 events in which men who come from the elite, and who have betrayed their class \u2013 Roderigo Duterte, in the Philippines, on May 9, was the straw in the wind, he was followed by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage in the UK, on June 23, and today by Donald Trump in the US, and they have, with the use of the internet social media, most especially Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook, successfully suckered the soggy mass of lazy, ill-educated, ill-read and ill-informed proles, and a good supply of what V.I. Lenin called \u201cuseful idiots\u201d, in three nations, into putting them into power, by telling lies and by promising the proles what they want. \\nWhat the proles want is \u2018good jobs\u2019 but with the ability to buy the stuff they buy now at cheap prices, because it is made by under paid, hardworking, men and women in other countries who have \u2018stolen their jobs\u2019, and they want \u2018no foreigners\u2019. They can\u2019t have this, of course, but no matter, they don\u2019t read, they just look at \u2018memes\u2019, and the damage is done. \\nLeave it to the Brits to work in the class angle, quote Lenin, and toss in an Orwell reference! \\n\u201cTrump voters will not like what happens next\u201d [Garrison Keillor, WaPo ]. \u201cAmerica is still the land where the waitress\u2019 kids can grow up to become physicists and novelists and pediatricians, but it helps a lot if the waitress and her husband encourage good habits and the ambition to use your God-given talents and the kids aren\u2019t plugged into electronics day and night.\u201d Help me. \\n\u201cAmericans have done a very dangerous thing this week. Because of what they have done we all face dark, uncertain and fearful times\u201d [ Guardian ]. \\n\u201c\u2018Dear God, America what have you done?\u2019: How the world and its media reacted as Donald Trump became US President-elect\u201d [ Telegraph ]. A nice round-up of front page images. \\nPolicy \\n\u201cTrump won largely because people couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Clinton, and not so much because anyone like him or his presumed agenda. And along the way he destroyed the Republican party, which may or may not sit so well with Republicans in Congress\u201d [ Mosler Economics] . \u201cSo it\u2019s not like he has a mandate to do anything or that he can rely on Republican support for anything.\u201d I\u2019m not so sure; I see the Republican primary and the general taken together a repudiation of both party establishments and the political class in its totality. That said, this is important: \\nRegarding his proposed tax cuts, under current law bills can\u2019t be introduced in Congress unless they are \u2018paid for\u2019, so, for example, to introduce a tax cut it has to be paid for by spending cuts. Yes, Congress could change the law or override it but that would require Senate approval, and that takes a 60% majority that Republicans don\u2019t have. \\nSo my point is that at best it\u2019s going to take a very long time to get anything done. And the way all the charts are decelerating it could all get pretty ugly waiting for the kind of fiscal adjustment needed to reverse course. \\n\u201cThe new Senate\u2019s Republican majority will remain short of the 60 votes needed for a full repeal. But Congress demonstrated in the past year that it could use the upper chamber\u2019s reconciliation process \u2014 requiring just 50 votes \u2014 to send a bill undoing major ACA elements to the White House. Last winter, President Obama vetoed that legislation\u201d [ WaPo ]. Meaning, of course, that the Democrats could have done exactly the same thing in 2009, but passed HR676 or SB703. That, throwing a bankster or two in jail, and a decent stimulus package instead of the one Larry Summers deked Obama into approving, and the Democrats might control all three branches of government today. And so it goes. \\nThe Voters \\n\u201cAs of 11:55 a.m. ET, Clinton had amassed 59,458,295 votes nationally, to Trump\u2019s 59,265,380 \u2014 a margin of 192,915 that puts Clinton on track to become the fifth U.S. presidential candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election\u201d [ NPR ].
