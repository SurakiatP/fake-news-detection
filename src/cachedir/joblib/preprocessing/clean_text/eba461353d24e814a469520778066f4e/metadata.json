[I learned this from a Berkeley professor of linguistics called George Lakoff who was given space by the BBC to spout his views, virtually unchallenged, for half an hour this week on a Radio 4 programme called Word of Mouth.  Lakoff was introduced as an \u201ceminent linguist\u201d at the \u201cforefront of the debate. \u201d But no indication was given by the presenter Michael Rosen that he is, in fact, a   professor from a   university best known for writing   books about how awful conservatives are and, most recently, for his vocal opposition to Donald Trump. Perhaps this is because Rosen is   himself. As I\u2019ve argued over similar issues before, none of this would matter a damn if Radio 4 were a commercial channel paid for by advertising or a subscription channel for smug liberals who wanted none of their prejudices challenged. But Radio 4 is neither of those things. It\u2019s a branch of Britain\u2019s state broadcasting arm, the BBC  \u2014   an organization funded by a compulsory subscription fee which all users are obliged to pay on pain of imprisonment. While it\u2019s true that you don\u2019t need a TV license to listen to the radio, it\u2019s also true that Radio 4 is a   beneficiary of the BBC\u2019s   domination of Britain\u2019s airwaves. It has virtually no competition in the field of   features on the radio, firstly, because it has dominated the medium for so long and secondly because it is so massively subsidised (hence the lack of irritating adverts!) it would be virtually suicidal for any commercial venture to try to compete with it. In return for this extremely privileged position \u2014  which ought, by rights, to have long since been withdrawn by   regulators  \u2014   it is obliged under the terms of the BBC\u2019s charter to produce output that is rigorously fair and balanced. This is why we should get cross: not because nasty, horrid, untrue things were said about Breitbart, but because nasty, horrid, untrue things were said about Breitbart by an organization wearing the mantle of authority and the mask of objectivity. Whether rightly or no, the BBC is a media outfit that commands considerable respect around the world. By allowing this professor to make his claims unchallenged on air, the BBC has legitimized the malign, dangerous, and defamatory notions that Breitbart is a) unprofessional, b) outside the realms of acceptable public discourse, and c) on par with the Nazis, the fascists, the Ku Klux Klan, and all the other groups routinely associated with the \u201cextreme right. \u201d And, note, that \u201cextreme right\u201d was not the phrase Lakoff used. Nope, it was \u201cvery extreme right. \u201d Now, suppose for a moment the BBC had managed to find a conservative professor of linguistics  \u2014   unlikely, I know, but just suppose  \u2026      \u2014   and he\u2019d vented about some   media outfit he didn\u2019t like, calling it \u201cextreme  \u201d and accusing it of putting out \u201cfake news. \u201d How do you think he would have been treated by the BBC? At the very least, I would suggest, the BBC would have invited him to justify his criticism. He certainly wouldn\u2019t have been given the free pass that was afforded this Berkeley leftist. The other thing that would have been routinely expected of him is a degree of expertise. What, after all, is the point of inviting an \u201cexpert\u201d on if he\u2019s not going to display superior insights into the subject that is supposedly his field? But, shamingly, Lakoff failed almost completely on this score. He claimed that \u201csnowflake\u201d is used as a \u201cslur against gays, who are seen as delicate and flakey. \u201d Really? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen \u201csnowflake\u201d used in that context. It\u2019s used as a term of mockery for hypersensitive millennials who prefer to be protected from ideas or language they don\u2019t agree with, whether they happen to be gay or straight is neither here nor there. He claimed that the phrase \u201calt right plays on the word \u2018alt,\u2019 meaning old, calling up issues from Germany, which is interesting. \u201d Do you see what the professor did there? Yep. Shameless beyond belief, I know, but he really did just invent a spurious etymology for the \u201calt\u201d in \u201calt right. \u201d (Of course, it stands for alternative and has nothing to do with the German word for \u201cold. \u201d) He then used it as a way of hinting that the people involved in the \u201calt right\u201d are sorta, kinda like Hitler. He claimed that the term \u201cfascists\u201d has been embraced by people on the right and that they are proud to define themselves in opposition to the \u201cantifas. \u201d Nope. Again, he has got it completely wrong. It\u2019s the left that uses \u201cfascist\u201d ad nauseam to describe anyone it disagrees with. \u201cAntifa\u201d is a term the left has chosen to point up this false distinction. He claimed that \u201c \u201d is a phrase proudly used by progressives to indicate \u201cI know what\u2019s right. These are our values. \u201d Again, 100 percent incorrect, professor. \u201c \u201d was a phrase coined by the classical   journalist James Bartholomew in the Spectatori to mock the left\u2019s priggish  . This, remember, is a professor of linguistics speaking. Knowing this stuff is his   job. But though he doesn\u2019t appear to have mastered even the basics, he is yet taken seriously enough by the BBC to spout his vile and ignorant prejudice for a full   on an afternoon radio show. Fake news indeed.'"}, "time": 1742562239.0938654}
