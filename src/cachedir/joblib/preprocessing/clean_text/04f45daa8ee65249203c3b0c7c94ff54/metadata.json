[The revelation comes just nine days before France heads to the polls for a   presidential election with Le Pen, who heads the eurosceptic Front National (FN) one of the frontrunners in the April 23 first round.  The demand was made at the end of last month after she invoked her parliamentary immunity in refusing to attend questioning by investigating magistrates on March 10. The case is linked to an expenses inquiry in which the European Parliament has accused Le Pen\u2019s FN of defrauding it to the tune of some 340, 000 euros ($360, 000). The parliament believes the party used funds allotted for parliamentary assistants to pay Le Pen\u2019s personal assistant Catherine Griset and her bodyguard Thierry Legier for party work in France. French investigators leading the case raided the party\u2019s headquarters outside Paris last month in a bid to determine whether the FN used European funds to pay for 20 assistants  \u2014   presented as parliamentary aides  \u2014   who were working for the party elsewhere. But Le Pen shrugged off the request, saying it was \u201cnormal\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s totally normal procedure, I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d she told Franceinfo radio.'"}, "time": 1742564161.6959288}
