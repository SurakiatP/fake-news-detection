[VIDEO: \u201cThat little boy was innocent,\u201d Community gathers to remember baby found in dumpster,  More than 400 people gathered on the lawn of the Garfield County Courthouse in Enid for a candlelight vigil to mourn the baby boy\u2019s death and celebrate his life, KOTV reported. The sound of motorcycles filled the air as the crowd gathered in the square. \u201cNo baby deserves that. They don\u2019t. That little boy was innocent. Never done anything to anybody in his life. It just didn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Mike Jarvis of the Chisholm Trail Motorcycle Group told KFOR. Police found the decomposing infant in a dumpster April 9 inside a trash bag placed in a box. \u201cIt\u2019s a baby. Like why would you do that to a baby? It\u2019s Enid\u2019s baby and you just don\u2019t do that to a kid,\u201d said Kassydi Reisner, who performed at the memorial. Mourners gathered in song with candles in hand as a way to band together in the face of tragedy. \u201cWhat happened in the dumpster is a tragedy, hands down, no doubts about it and that\u2019s not how we do this as a community. We come together, and we will make things right,\u201d Bill Stittsworth said. Stittsworth, who is a funeral home director and embalmer with Amy Stittsworth Funeral Service, said he is donating a casket to the baby and providing private funeral services at a later date, KWTV reported. Police are conducting DNA tests to determine the baby boy\u2019s mother.'"}, "time": 1742628510.4863975}
