[\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the possibility that it happens, but the prospects of an Israeli retaliation if Iranian forces come near its border,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael made it clear, publicly and behind the scenes, that it would not tolerate Hezbollah and Revolutionary Guards\u2019 presence along its border. \u201d  \u201cIran has exploited the campaign against Nusra Front and the Islamic State to take root in the border area,\u201d he said. \u201cJordan and Israel too would like to see these organizations out, but not to the point that Hezbollah and Iran fill the void. \u201d Lately, Israel and Jordan have cooperated closely on the matter, he stated. \u201cIsrael knows that Jordan needs to act against extremist elements but both want to prevent Iran from taking advantage of it. \u201d \u201cIt is also in [Syrian President Bashar] Assad\u2019s best interest to keep the Iranians out,\u201d the official contended. \u201cTrue, he has stated that the Golan Heights would be liberated by force, and he relies heavily on Hezbollah and Iran. But at some point he\u2019d wish to rule over his own border areas, which is something Jordan can live with. But not Iran. \u201d He added that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards tried several times in the past to gain a foothold in Jordan. \u201cBut these cells were unveiled and dismantled before they became operational. \u201d He added that the joint operation room of the Syrian opposition groups has become almost completely inactive. \u201cIts activity has been dramatically reduced,\u201d he said of the operation room. \u201cThere are no more operational and tactical plans and directives. The world wants first and foremost to remove the jihadist threat, but the elements in the region believe that the jihadi threat will be replaced by an Iranian one. \u201d He said that Jordan has rebuffed Iranian proposals to increase economic cooperation despite the financial dire straits in which the Kingdom finds itself. \u201cThey want to prevent Iran from having any kind of foothold in the kingdom. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564261.646945}
