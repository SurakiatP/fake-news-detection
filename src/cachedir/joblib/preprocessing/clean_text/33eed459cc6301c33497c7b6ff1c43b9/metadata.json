C. in anticipation of the live airing of a Senate hearing featuring former FBI Director James Comey, many left disappointed. [At least 50 people were in line before the bar opened at 9:30 a. m. for the 10:00 a. m. Senate intelligence hearing, including unemployed former government officials. A woman standing in line at Union Pub said she looked forward to hearing \u201cComey tell the truth. \u201d  But after roughly     hours, people shuffled out, calling it \u201cunderwhelming. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s what I expected, it\u2019s underwhelming, nothing explosive has been revealed so far. James Comey is pragmatic, he\u2019s a Washingtonian who still has a lot of his future career ahead of him. He does not want to create unnecessary conflict,\u201d said one man, who wished not to be named. \u201cThe investigation is not a public matter. It is a legal, technical, and professional matter. But people here in DC are turning it into the Super Bowl,\u201d said another man, who also did not want to be named. An office manager at a university named Derek said he was happy that Comey called the President a \u201cliar\u201d but said he wanted some evidence. \u201cI want there to be tapes,\u201d he said. Another man who wished to remain anonymous said he was \u201choping to hear more damning testimony, more smoking guns,\u201d but that Comey \u201cphrased things carefully to be accurate. \u201d One man with a computer wallpaper that said \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d refused to talk to Breitbart. Several people said they hoped more would come out of a closed hearing later in the day, where Comey can discuss classified information. \u201cWhat we got out of this hearing was an affirmation of what we already knew. Any juicy bombshells will come out of the closed door meetings,\u201d he said. A man named Ben, who is currently unemployed but used to work at the State Department, said that the \u201cbest hope\u201d for Trump getting impeached would be the Democrats winning the House, since he doesn\u2019t see Republicans going along with it. But one man, Christopher, who worked at Trader Joe\u2019s, said he was happy with Comey\u2019s performance, despite him not opining on whether there was any obstruction of justice. \u201cComey was in control, got his message out. He knows it\u2019s not to say whether it\u2019s obstruction. He did what he set out to do,\u201d he said. Another said he came just to \u201cenjoy Comey\u2019s testimony. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a rock of integrity,\u201d Tom, a computer science major, said. \u201cHe\u2019s willingly testified against and for both sides. \u201d Another man, Alex, who works in environmental relations for a utility, did not hide his anger. \u201cMy take can\u2019t be quoted in a family friendly publication. It shows how   everything is  \u2014   a bunch of senior Republicans abase themselves in a grotesque manner as they run flack for a man they\u2019re covering for him and abasing themselves even though this is national security,\u201d he said. Paul, an Army veteran and Ph. D. student, said there was \u201csomething for everyone here. \u201d \u201cThis is just confirmation bias both sides will find stuff that benefits them,\u201d he said. There was only one person, a government affairs intern named Alex, who identified himself as a Republican in the elite DC watering hole. He called the hearing \u201csame old, same old. \u201d \u201cThe only person who effectively pressed Comey was Marco Rubio. I\u2019m not a Trump fanatic, but if he does well, it\u2019s good for the country. We have an issue in this country of unprecedented division,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561756.3356233}
