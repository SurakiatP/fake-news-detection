Trump, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d opened with its vision of the most powerful man in the world  \u2014   President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, smirking and chiding Mr. Trump for early missteps  \u2014   followed by a monologue from the show\u2019s host, Aziz Ansari, who commented on issues of race in   America and implored Mr. Trump to directly address them himself. Airing one day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d which the president hosted as a candidate and has regularly attacked on Twitter, did not feature an appearance from its resident Trump impersonator, Alec Baldwin. Instead the show opened with the cast member Beck Bennett playing a   Mr. Putin and boasting of helping to get Mr. Trump elected. \u201cToday many of you are scared and marching in the streets,\u201d the Putin character said. \u201cYou are worried that your country is in the hands of this unpredictable man. But don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not. Relax. I got this. Putey\u2019s going to make everything O. K. \u201d He added that Russia would take care of America because \u201cit\u2019s the most expensive thing we\u2019ve ever bought. \u201d Addressing Mr. Trump directly, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not off to a great start, man. I thought you\u2019d be better at this. However, I\u2019m glad to see so many people showed up to your inauguration. \u201d The screen then showed video of a crowd of demonstrators on Saturday at the Women\u2019s March on Washington, which was then corrected to an image of the more sparsely populated National Mall on Friday during the Trump inaugural festivities. \u201cToday,\u201d the Putin character said, \u201cyou went to the C. I. A. and said one million people came to see you in Washington D. C.? If you\u2019re going to lie, don\u2019t make it so obvious. Say you are friends with LeBron James, not that you are LeBron James. \u201d Mr. Ansari, the Emmy     and star of the Netflix series \u201cMaster of None,\u201d and the first performer of South Asian descent to host \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d picked up on some of these themes in his monologue. \u201cYesterday, Trump was inaugurated,\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cToday, an entire gender protested against him. \u201d Urging Americans to treat each other with respect, Mr. Ansari said that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory had nonetheless empowered a \u201ctiny slice of people that have gotten way too fired up. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m talking about these people that, as soon as Trump won, they\u2019re like, \u2018We don\u2019t have to pretend like we\u2019re not racist anymore!\u2019 \u201d he said. (In doing so, he gave a fist pump that gradually became a Nazi salute.) \u201cNo, no,\u201d Mr. Ansari added. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of these people, please go back to pretending. \u201d Mr. Ansari reflected on the ascent of what he called \u201cthis new   K. K. K. movement that started  \u2014   this kind of casual white supremacy,\u201d which includes people who tell him to go back to where he came from, but don\u2019t know his heritage. (\u201cThey\u2019re not usually geography buffs,\u201d he said.) \u201cMy parents moved from India to South Carolina in the early \u201980s,\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t move until nine years ago. You know where they moved? North Carolina. They love it here. They\u2019re not leaving. \u201d He continued: \u201cI think Trump should make a speech. A real speech denouncing the   K. K. K. Don\u2019t tweet about me being lame or the show. Write a speech. A real speech. \u201d Mr. Ansari pointed out that President George W. Bush made a speech after the Sept. 11 attacks in which he said its perpetrators did not represent Islam. \u201cEveryone applauded  \u2014   Democrats, Republicans, didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cIt was not about politics. It was about basic human decency and remembering why the country was founded in the first place. \u201d He continued: \u201cI was like, what the hell has happened? I\u2019m sitting here wistfully watching old George W. Bush speeches?\u201d In closing, Mr. Ansari acknowledged that many viewers were likely to be fearful of what the next four years held in store. \u201cIf you\u2019re excited about Trump, great,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s president. Let\u2019s hope he does a great job. If you\u2019re scared about Trump and you\u2019re very worried, you\u2019re going to be O. K. too. \u201cBecause if you look at our country\u2019s history,\u201d he continued, \u201cchange doesn\u2019t come from presidents. Change comes from large groups of angry people. And if Day 1 is any indication, you are part of the largest group of angry people I have ever seen. \u201d Other segments in the show included a musical   of Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s adviser, where Kate McKinnon played her as Roxie Hart from \u201cChicago,\u201d and a   to President Obama in which Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata serenaded his picture with the title song from \u201cTo Sir, With Love. \u201d Mr. Trump most recently denounced his satirical portrayal on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last week, writing in a tweet: \u201cNBC News is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!\u201d Whether he will comment on the show now that he is in the White House remains to be seen as of early Sunday, he had not done so. On Friday, Katie Rich, a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was widely criticized for a tweet she posted in which she wrote that Mr. Trump\u2019s    son, Barron, would be \u201cthis country\u2019s first homeschool shooter. \u201d Ms. Rich subsequently deleted the tweet and took down her personal Twitter account.'"}, "time": 1742561992.5908706}
