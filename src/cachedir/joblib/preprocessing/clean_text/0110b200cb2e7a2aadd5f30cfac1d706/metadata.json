Rather than apathetically accepting the situation \u2013 like in America \u2013 South Koreans have risen up and the media has rounded on their leader. Citizens have taken to the streets en masse and the country\u2019s media have called for the president to step down immediately \u2013 or face impeachment. \\nThe essence of the scandal is this: It has emerged that Park, famously aloof even to top officials and aides, has been taking instructions from a group known as the \u201ceight fairies\u201d including Choi Soon-sil, a shadowy billionaire with ties to George Soros and Angela Merkel. Choi has existed around the edges of South Korean power circles for decades, but has never held an official position. Posters of the president being controlled by puppet strings are cropping up all over South Korea as country-wide protests continue to rage. Recommended (4 months ago) France: Protestors Rise Up In Their Millions Against Ruling Class \\nThe Washington Post reports that \u201cCalls for her resignation \u2014 and even impeachment \u2014 are resonating from across the political spectrum, and her approval ratings have dropped to a record low of 17 percent, according to two polls released Friday. \\nOn Friday, Park directed all of her top advisers to resign en masse, with her spokesman saying a reshuffle would take place, the Yonhap news agency reported. Kim Jae-won, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, told a parliamentary session that Park\u2019s chief of staff had already stepped down. \\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether it will be enough. \\n\u201cPark Geun-hye\u2019s leadership is on the brink of collapse,\u201d said Yoo Chang-sun, a left-leaning political analyst. Shin Yool, a right-leaning professor at Myongji University, called it the \u201cbiggest crisis\u201d since South Korea was founded 70 years ago. \u201cThe president has lost her ability to function as leader.\u201d \\nChoi is the daughter of the late Choi Tae-min, who was a kind of shaman-fortune teller described in a 2007 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul as \u201ca charismatic pastor.\u201d Locally, he\u2019s seen as a \u201cKorean Rasputin\u201d who once held sway over Park after her mother was assassinated in 1974. \\n\u201cRumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park\u2019s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result,\u201d read the cable, released by WikiLeaks. \\nPark has strongly denied any improper relationship. \\nBut South Korean media have uncovered evidence that, they claim, shows that Choi Soon-sil wielded undue influence over the president. \\nJTBC, a television network, said it had found a tablet computer that contained files of speeches the president had yet to give, among other documents. The younger Choi is said to have edited the landmark speech that Park gave in Germany in 2014, laying out her vision for unification with the North. The Hankyoreh newspaper wrote that actual presidential aides \u201cwere just mice to Choi\u2019s cat.\u201d \\nShe is also rumored to have created a secret group called \u201cthe eight fairies\u201d to advise the president behind the scenes. \\nTV Chosun, the channel belonging to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, aired a clip showing Choi overseeing the making of an outfit for Park, \u201craising doubt whether Park made any decision at all without Choi,\u201d the paper said. \\nSouth Korean media have been full of Photoshopped graphics to illustrate the relationship, including one showing Park as a puppet and Choi Soon-sil pulling her strings. \\nMeanwhile, investigators are looking into allegations that Choi siphoned off money from two recently established foundations that collected about $70 million from the Federation of Korean Industries, the big business lobby with members including Samsung and Hyundai. Prosecutors raided Choi\u2019s home in Seoul this week looking for evidence. \\nAt the same time, there are allegations that the daughter of Choi Soon-sil was given special treatment when she applied for Ewha Womans University, one of South Korea\u2019s top colleges. \\nLocal media have reported that her daughter\u2019s grades were not good enough, so the rules were changed to give credit to applicants who had won equestrian awards, as she had. The already-embattled president of Ewha resigned this week. \\nIronically, this all comes less than a month after Park\u2019s administration instituted a wide-ranging new law aimed at cracking down on corruption and influence peddling. \\nChoi is in Germany with her daughter and is refusing to return to South Korea to answer questions, saying she is having heart problems and cannot fly. But in an interview with the Segye Ilbo, she denied creating the Eight Fairies group, owning the tablet or knowingly receiving classified information. \u201cBecause I was not a government official, I had no idea that this was confidential,\u201d she told the paper. \\nPark apologized Tuesday for the scandal, saying she had always acted \u201cwith a pure heart.\u201d Then she canceled a planned meeting related to North Korea on Friday so she could consider ways to \u201cresolve the nation\u2019s anxiety and stably run the government,\u201d according to a spokesman. \\nShe did, however, attend a ceremony in the southern city of Busan, where university students shouted \u201cPark Geun-hye should step down!\u201d and \u201cChoi Soon-sil must be arrested!\u201d Share:'"}, "time": 1742562064.683716}
