S. military confirmed a military exercise by Air Force   Lancer bombers over the South China Sea Thursday, a move that prompted Beijing, which illegally claims most of the sea, to remind Washington that it remains \u201cvigilant\u201d before U. S. exercises. [\u201cChina always maintains vigilance and effective monitoring of the relevant country\u2019s military activities in the South China Sea,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. \u201cChina\u2019s military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability. \u201d  The Chinese government typically responds to American exercises in the region rapidly. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the sovereign territories of Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the waters off the coast of Indonesia. The Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague ruled last year that China\u2019s claims on the Spratly and Paracel Islands \u2014  sovereign territory of Vietnam and the Philippines \u2014  were not valid, and China must cease its construction of military facilities in the region. China vowed to ignore the ruling and any other such international legal resolution. The United States has participated in challenging these illegal territorial claims through a variety of measures, from Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) within 12 nautical miles of the territory China claims, and military exercises both unilateral and joint with allied nations in the region. U. S. Pacific Command described the exercise on Thursday as part of a greater \u201ccontinuous bomber presence\u201d program, which included the participation of the bombers and the USS Sterett. According to an extensive report in the Japan Times, the mission lasted ten hours and was launched out of U. S. territory in Guam. The goal of the operation was to improve coordination between the ship and the bombers \u201cby refining joint tactics, techniques and procedures while simultaneously strengthening their ability to seamlessly integrate their operations,\u201d Pacific Command said. The statement explicitly did not refer to the operation as an FONOP. The report also did not address recent reports suggesting that the Chinese government has continued to expand its military presence in the region. The Pentagon recently submitted a report to Congress detailing advances in the militarizing of the Spratly Island chain. \u201cChina\u2019s Spratly Islands outpost expansion effort is currently focused on building out the   capabilities of its three largest outposts \u2014  Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs \u2014  after completion of its four smaller outposts early in 2016,\u201d the report read, according to the South China Morning Post. \u201cOnce all these facilities are complete, China will have the capacity to house up to three regiments of fighters in the Spratly Islands. \u201d Among the new facilities are 24 \u201c  hangars,   positions and other   infrastructure\u201d on the reefs mentioned. The Chinese Foreign Ministry rejected the report. \u201cChina pursues the path of peaceful development and a national defense policy. China\u2019s defense development is aimed at safeguarding state independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d spokeswoman Hua Chunying said this week, according to the   Global Times. As the report also mentioned potential Chinese expansion into Pakistan, Hua chided the United States and claimed cooperation with the Pakistani government \u201cis not targeted at any third party. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562226.7268941}
