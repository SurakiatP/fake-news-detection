He says \u2018\u2018now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box.\u2019\u2019 \\nTrump kicked off his Election Day eve blitz with a rally Monday in Florida. He told the Sarasota crowd that \u2018\u2018the system is rigged, but at least we know it.\u2019\u2019 \\nHe claimed that \u2018\u2018our country is a laughing stock all over the world.\u2019\u2019 \\nThe Republican nominee than pantomimed quotation marks when he said the word \u2018\u2018justice\u2019\u2019 as he hit the FBI and the Department of Justice for their handling of the case. \\nFBI Director James Comey notified Congress Sunday that a review of new emails connected to Clinton\u2019s servers did produce evidence that would warrant charges. \\n11:45 a.m. \\nAn ex-aide to former President Bill Clinton alleged in a hacked email that Chelsea Clinton used the family\u2019s charitable foundation to help underwrite her 2010 wedding. \\nThe 2012 exchange between Doug Band and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was released by the WikiLeaks organization. Stolen messages have chronicled tensions within the Clinton Foundation between Band and the daughter of the Democratic presidential nominee. \\nBand told Podesta that Chelsea Clinton was gossiping to outsiders that she was investigating questionable spending. Band suggested that she is the one who should be scrutinized for \u2018\u2018using foundation resources for her wedding.\u2019\u2019 He did not provide details about this. A Clinton Foundation spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \\nBand was later forced out amid issues with his outside consulting firm. \\n___ \\n11:40 a.m. \\nDonald Trump is kicking off his last, breakneck day of campaigning before polls open with a rally in Sarasota, Florida. \\nTrump is telling thousands of supporters packed into a local fairgrounds arena Monday that the election is now in their hands. \\nHe told them: \u2018\u2018Get out there. I mean, I did my thing. I worked.\u2019\u2019 \\nTrump is planning to continue a frenzied campaign pace, with rallies in five states Monday, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. \\nTrump is also continuing to paint rival Hillary Clinton as a corrupt and alluding to the scrutiny of her use of a private email sever as secretary of state. \\nTrump is also having some fun. At one point, he held up a mask in his likeness and complimented its hair. \\n___ \\n11:30 a.m. \\nThe White House says it will \u2018\u2018neither defend nor criticize\u2019\u2019 FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to send a new letter to Congress about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. \\nThat\u2019s the same phrasing the White House used when Comey initially announced that the FBI was looking into more emails related to its investigation of Clinton. In a follow-up letter Sunday, Comey said the FBI review was completed and it was standing by its recommendation that no charges be filed. \\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest on Monday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the White House hasn\u2019t been briefed on the investigation and didn\u2019t receive advance notice about Comey\u2019s latest letter. \\nEarnest says Obama still has confidence in Comey. \\n___ \\n10:50 a.m. \\nPhiladelphia\u2019s public transit system will be up and running in time for Election Day now that a weeklong strike has ended. That\u2019s a relief to the state\u2019s Democrats. \\nDemocratic city officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls Tuesday. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. \\nThe state has favored Democrats in recent presidential elections, but polls suggest the race is tightening. Democrat Hillary Clinton is counting on strong support in the Philadelphia area. Both candidates are campaigning in the state Tuesday. \\nThe Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the union representing roughly 4,700 transit workers announced a tentative agreement early Monday. Subways were soon operating on a reduced schedule and limited trolled serve was restored. \\n___ \\n10:30 a.m. \\nThe Justice Department says it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That\u2019s a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago. \\nDepartment officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. Monday\u2019s announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. \\nThe number of personnel is less than the roughly 780 monitors and observers who were dispatched in 2012. \\nThe Justice Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. \\nIn a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the department is committed to ensuring that every eligible voter can participate in the election. \\n___ \\n10:25 a.m. \\nHillary Clinton is departing on a multi-stop swing of the presidential battleground states on the day before the election. She\u2019s telling reporters that \u2018\u2018we\u2019re just going to work until the last vote is counted.\u2019\u2019 \\nClinton said Monday that while she thinks she has \u2018\u2018some work to do to bring the country together,\u2019\u2019 she wants to be the president for those who vote for her and those who don\u2019t. She was speaking to reporters at an airport outside New York City. \\nClinton said she has \u2018\u2018a big agenda ahead of us\u2019\u2019 and is vowing to \u2018\u2018get a lot done\u2019\u2019 if she defeats Republican Donald Trump. \\nThe Democratic presidential nominee was campaigning in Pittsburgh; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Philadelphia and Raleigh, North Carolina. \\n___ \\n8:55 a.m. \\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he doesn\u2019t know if the George Washington Bridge lane closure controversy cost him the vice presidential nomination. \\nChristie said Monday on \u2018\u2018CBS This Morning\u2019\u2019 that he was runner-up to be Republican Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick. He denied a report that Trump had offered him the job, then rescinded it. He said he thinks Trump thought Indian governor Mike Pence was the better choice. \\nTwo of Christie\u2019s former allies were convicted Friday for their role in re-aligning access lanes to the bridge in a political revenge plot against a Democratic mayor who didn\u2019t endorse him. \\nChristie says he thinks Trump will defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton Tuesday because the momentum is on his side and the country wants change. \\n___ \\n8:35 a.m. \\nOhio Democrats want the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in their voter intimidation lawsuit in the swing state. \\nThe party has filed an emergency request for the nation\u2019s high court to lift a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court order. That ruling Sunday granted the Donald Trump campaign\u2019s request to block a federal judge\u2019s restraining order Democrats said was needed to prevent voter intimidation. \\nA 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel said Ohio Democrats didn\u2019t show \u2018\u2018a likelihood of success\u2019\u2019 on their case\u2019s merits. \\nThe party told the U.S. Supreme Court the appellate judges ruled without reviewing \u2018\u2018critical evidence\u2019\u2019 a lower court judge relied on in ruling that anyone engaging in intimidation or harassment inside or near polling places would face contempt of court charges. \\n___ \\n7:35 a.m. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign manager says it\u2019s not true that his staff has stopped him from tweeting. \\nTrump has exhibited unusual restraint on social media in the final days of the campaign. The New York Times reported on Sunday that aides \u2018\u2018have finally wrested away\u2019\u2019 his Twitter account. \\nPresident Barack Obama seized on the report at a voter rally in Florida, telling the crowd that anyone who can\u2019t be trusted with a Twitter account shouldn\u2019t be trusted with control of the America\u2019s nuclear weapons. \\nWhen asked Monday about the Times report by NBC\u2019s \u2018\u2018Today Show,\u2019\u2019 campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said: \u2018\u2018No, it\u2019s not true.\u2019\u2019 \\n___ \\n3:15 a.m. \\nWith the cloud of an FBI investigation lifted, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump struck strikingly different tones as they moved into the final hours of a volatile, nearly two-year-long presidential campaign. \\nAfter days of attacks on Trump\u2019s qualifications and temperament, Clinton cast herself as the candidate of \u2018\u2018healing and reconciliation,\u2019\u2019 perhaps a surprising position for one of the most divisive figures in American politics. Trump, meanwhile, voiced new confidence as he brought his campaign \u2014 and his dark visions of a rigged American economic and political system\u2014 to longtime Democratic strongholds. \\nOvershadowing the flurry of last-minute campaigning was FBI Director James Comey\u2019s latest letter to Congress, informing lawmakers the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742564417.0785375}
