She was 92. Her death was confirmed by the Eagle Forum, the conservative organization she founded in 1975. In her time, Mrs. Schlafly was one of the most polarizing figures in American public life, a   housewife who displayed a moral ferocity reminiscent of the   prohibitionist Carry Nation. Richard Viguerie, who masterminded the use of direct mail to finance   causes, called her \u201cthe first lady of the conservative movement. \u201d On the left, Betty Friedan, the feminist leader and author, compared her to a religious heretic, telling her in a debate that she should burn at the stake for opposing the Equal Rights Amendment. Ms. Friedan called Mrs. Schlafly an \u201cAunt Tom. \u201d Mrs. Schlafly became a forceful conservative voice in the 1950s, when she joined the   crusade against international Communism. In the 1960s, with her popular   book \u201cA Choice Not an Echo\u201d (it sold more than three million copies) and a growing legion of followers, she gave critical support to the presidential ambitions of Senator Barry Goldwater, the   Arizonan who went on to lead the Republican Party to electoral disaster in 1964, but who planted the seeds of a conservative revival that would flower with the rise of Ronald Reagan. And in the 1970s, Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment played a large part in its undoing. The amendment would have expanded women\u2019s rights by barring any   distinctions in federal and state laws, and it was within hailing distance of becoming the law of the land: Both houses of Congress had passed it by a vote of more than 90 percent, and 35 state legislatures  \u2014   only three shy of the number required for adoption  \u2014   had approved it. But the amendment lost steam in the late 1970s under pressure from Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s volunteer brigades  \u2014   mainly women, most of them churchgoing Christians (Mrs. Schlafly was Roman Catholic) and not a few of them lugging apple pies to cajole legislators. Despite an extension of the deadline, the amendment died, on June 30, 1982. Many saw her ability to mobilize that citizens\u2019 army as her greatest accomplishment. Angered by the cultural transformations of the 1960s, beginning with the 1962 Supreme Court ruling prohibiting   prayer in public schools, her \u201clittle old ladies in tennis shoes,\u201d as some called them, went from ringing doorbells for Goldwater to serving as foot soldiers for the \u201cReagan revolution. \u201d \u201cSchlafly had discovered a genuine populist sentiment in a large female population that opposed the E. R. A. feminism and modern liberalism with the same intensity of emotion that feminists brought to their cause,\u201d Donald T. Critchlow wrote in \u201cPhyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman\u2019s Crusade\u201d (2005). Without her and her followers, Mr. Critchlow said, the conservative intellectuals, research organizations and foundations that are often credited with reshaping the contours of American politics might have failed. The conservative theorist and organizer Paul Weyrich said that Mrs. Schlafly \u201cdressed up the conservative movement for success at a time when absolutely no one thought we could win. \u201d Even liberals conceded her impact. \u201cIf political influence consists in transforming this huge and cantankerous country in one\u2019s preferred direction,\u201d the political scientist Alan Wolfe wrote in The New Republic in 2005, \u201cSchlafly has to be regarded as one of the two or three most important Americans of the last half of the 20th century\u201d  \u2014   although he hastened to add that \u201cevery idea she ever had was scatterbrained, dangerous and hateful. \u201d For all her political heft, it was Phyllis Schlafly the person who often animated discussion. With her pearls, perfect posture and Daughters of the American Revolution pedigree, she basked in depictions of herself as the perfect wife and mother. She let it drop that she   all six of her babies and that she had taught all her children to read before they started school. Feminists said it was her husband\u2019s wealth  \u2014   he was a lawyer from a rich Illinois family  \u2014   that had liberated her to politick. Her energy was formidable. She wrote or edited more than 20 books, published an influential monthly newsletter beginning in 1967, appeared daily on nearly 500 radio stations and delivered regular commentaries on CBS television in the 1970s and CNN in the \u201980s. In 1972, she formed a volunteer organization called Stop ERA, which three years later became the Eagle Forum, to coordinate her campaigns. In 1975, when she was living in Alton, Ill. Mrs. Schlafly announced to her family at dinner that she was going to enter law school at Washington University in nearby St. Louis. Her husband, by her account, disapproved of the idea at first, and she abandoned it, only to resurrect it when he changed his mind. She received her law degree in 1978, ranked 27th in a class of 186, and passed the Illinois bar a few months later. Some opponents called Mrs. Schlafly a hypocrite for pursuing so energetic a career while championing traditional female roles. She replied by calling her political career \u201ca hobby\u201d and saying she would never offer an opinion on whether women should or should not work outside the home. Other detractors, like Karen DeCrow, a former president of the National Organization for Women, praised Mrs. Schlafly even as they castigated her politics. \u201cShe\u2019s an extremely liberated woman,\u201d Ms. DeCrow said in an interview with Carol Felsenthal for her book \u201cThe Sweetheart of the Silent Majority: The Biography of Phyllis Schlafly\u201d (1981). \u201cShe sets out to do something and she does it. To me, that\u2019s liberation. \u201d Still, Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s pronouncements drove her antagonists to distraction, though they suspected that her biting language was calculated precisely to provoke their outrage. She said that \u201csexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women\u201d and that \u201c  classes are like   sales parties for abortions. \u201d She called the atom bomb \u201ca marvelous gift that was given to our country by a wise God. \u201d In 1980, a protester threw an apple pie in her face at a Women\u2019s National Republican Club reception in New York, painfully scratching an eye. But Mrs. Schlafly was never outwardly ruffled. When Ms. Friedan, during a debate at Indiana University in 1973, recommended that she burn at the stake, Mrs. Schlafly replied in an even voice that she was pleased Ms. Friedan had said that because, she said, the comment had made it plain to the audience just how intolerant \u201cintemperate, agitating proponents of the E. R. A. \u201d were. She was born Phyllis McAlpin Stewart on Aug. 15, 1924, in St. Louis, the oldest of two daughters of the former Odile Dodge, a teacher with two college degrees, and John Bruce Stewart, a machinist and industrial equipment salesman who was 17 years his wife\u2019s senior. Fired by Westinghouse at the onset of the Depression, Mr. Stewart was never quite able to put the family\u2019s finances back together. In 1944, he won a patent for a rotary car engine, of the type the Japanese automaker Mazda later sold, but it went nowhere. Despite his hardships, Mr. Stewart remained a staunch Republican, fiercely opposed to the New Deal. Mrs. Stewart, who was ambitious for her daughters, supported the family with a series of jobs: department store saleswoman, elementary school teacher and librarian at the St. Louis Art Museum. In her spare time, she wrote a book on the history of St. Louis. Ms. Felsenthal suggested in her book that Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s impatience with women who denigrated homemaking stemmed in part from her mother\u2019s wish that she could have kept house and worked for good causes rather than report for work six days a week. Phyllis Stewart attended Maryville College of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis (now Maryville University) and transferred to Washington University. She had no time for friends, dates or sororities, she wrote instead, as a student, she worked nights at a munitions factory   guns. Even so, she managed to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in only three years, at 19. She won a scholarship to study political science at Radcliffe, and earned a master\u2019s degree there in nine months. Her politics were middle of the road at first. In 1940, she supported the moderate Republican Wendell Willkie in his bid to deny President Franklin D. Roosevelt a third term, and in graduate school she wrote papers supporting an active United Nations. Her ambition was to work for the federal government in Washington. When no government jobs turned up, she found a spot at a conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Association, the forerunner of the American Enterprise Institute. Educating herself in conservative philosophy, she submitted articles against the New Deal to Redbook and other magazines, but they were rejected. In 1946, she returned to St. Louis to work on the successful congressional campaign of Claude I. Bakewell, a Republican. After that, she worked as a librarian and researcher at a bank and, at 24, met John Fred Schlafly Jr. a    lawyer and politically engaged conservative from an Alton family that had made its money in banking and industry. They were married on Oct. 20, 1949. At the ceremony, Mrs. Schlafly said, she did not promise to obey, only to cherish. But she delighted in portraying herself as a traditional wife, even as she kept to a hectic pace of travel, writing, speaking and campaigning after her oldest child turned 18 months. \u201cI want to thank my husband, Fred, for letting me come here\u201d was a favorite opening for speeches. (\u201cI like to say that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know it irritates women\u2019s libbers more than anything else. \u201d) But the writer Gail Sheehy suggested that Mrs. Schlafly had used marriage to liberate herself from paying jobs. \u201cPhyllis Schlafly\u2019s formula for the better life, then, is based on marrying a rich professional, climbing the pedestal to lady of leisure and pulling up the rope ladder behind her,\u201d Ms. Sheehy wrote in The New York Times in 1980. Mrs. Schlafly was introduced to electoral politics in 1952, after Republicans had asked her husband to run for Congress. When he turned them down, Mrs. Schlafly, who was 27, volunteered in his stead. She won the Republican primary but lost the general election. That experience, she said, helped her overcome her natural shyness, and she went on to make dozens of speeches in Illinois as an officer of the Daughters of the American Revolution and to start building a national network of conservative friends. She was the president of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women from 1956 to 1964. In 1958, she and her husband started the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation  \u2014   named for the Roman Catholic leader who was tortured and imprisoned by Hungarian Communists  \u2014   to educate Catholics on the dangers of Communism. Beginning in 1962, she hosted a   radio show on national security called \u201cAmerica Wake Up. \u201d It was carried by 25 Illinois stations. The Schlaflys\u2019 politics were concentrated on the external threat posed by Communism, not the crusade against domestic Communist infiltration led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. They opposed summit meetings and limits on nuclear testing and favored a constitutional amendment to prevent the president from negotiating international treaties. Many members of the Mindszenty Foundation were also members of the ultraright John Birch Society, and its founder, Robert Welch, once called Mrs. Schlafly \u201cone of our most loyal members. \u201d The Schlaflys denied they were members. In 1964, Mrs. Schlafly was an active supporter of Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign. In her     book promoting his candidacy, \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d she contended that Republican presidential nominations were rigged by \u201csecret kingmakers. \u201d By some estimates, the book sold as many as 3. 5 million copies. Writing in The New Yorker in 2005, Elizabeth Kolbert said the book \u201cmixed fact, sensational accusations, commonsensical truths, and elaborate conspiracy theories into a compelling but evidently bogus narrative. \u201d Mrs. Schlafly became closely identified with Goldwater\u2019s landslide defeat in 1964, and in 1967 she lost a bitter campaign for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women. Another run for Congress, from another Illinois district, in 1970, also ended in defeat. During much of the 1960s and \u201970s, Mrs. Schlafly wrote books about national defense issues, often working with Chester Ward, a retired Navy admiral. Their \u201cKissinger on the Couch\u201d (1975) begins with a proposition: \u201cSuppose that Henry Kissinger is, in the common parlance, \u2018some kind of nut or something. \u2019\u201d In more than 800 pages, they argued that he was. Mrs. Schlafly hardly noticed the Equal Rights Amendment when it was first debated in Congress. Her initial inclination was to support it, as \u201csomething between innocuous and mildly helpful,\u201d she told Ms. Felsenthal. But when, in December 1971, a friend asked her to debate a feminist on the amendment, she read up on the issue and decided that the E. R. A. was dangerous and needed to be stopped. It had already passed the House. The next October, Mrs. Schlafly founded and appointed herself chairwoman of Stop ERA, the volunteer organization that became the Eagle Forum. The \u201cstop\u201d was an acronym for \u201cstop taking our privileges,\u201d effectively summarizing the position of the amendment\u2019s opponents. They worried that earlier laws written to protect women  \u2014   guaranteeing alimony and exempting women from combat, for instance  \u2014   would be jettisoned. \u201cI simply didn\u2019t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women\u2019s rights,\u201d Mrs. Schlafly told The Times in 2006. \u201cI knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband\u2019s permission to make wine. \u201d Proponents of the amendment have said that even though courts and legislatures have set aside statutes that discriminate based on sex, the amendment would still retain symbolic importance. Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s followers only grew in number after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, an issue that social conservatives saw as a further erosion of the country\u2019s moral values. After her husband died in 1993, Mrs. Schlafly moved from their limestone house on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Alton to a brick   house in the suburbs of St. Louis, where the Eagle Forum has its headquarters. Mrs. Schlafly is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and three  . Her son John gained attention in 1992 when a gay activist revealed that he was homosexual. Mrs. Schlafly said she considered the disclosure a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. The revelation did not alter her disapproval of gay marriage. In 2010, she said of gay couples: \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping them from shacking up. The problem is that they are trying to make us respect them, and that\u2019s an interference with what we believe. \u201d (John Schlafly defended his mother and refused to repudiate Republican politicians, like Pat Robertson, who had condemned homosexuality. \u201cFamily values people\u201d are \u201cnot out to bash gays,\u201d he said.) Mrs. Schlafly maintained an energetic pace into advanced age. In 2011, she spoke out for \u201cshotgun marriages\u201d as the solution to unwanted pregnancies. Even as supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment tried to revive it, Mrs. Schlafly strove to make sure it stayed dead. In March of this year, she endorsed Donald J. Trump for president, saying he had \u201cthe courage and the energy\u201d to do \u201cwhat the   want him to do. \u201d In her 2006 interview with The Times, she attributed the improvement in women\u2019s lives in the 20th century not to feminism but to   devices like the indoor clothes dryer and paper diapers. \u201cFeminism has changed the way women think, and it has changed the way men think,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the trouble is, it hasn\u2019t changed the attitudes of babies at all. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562349.2349174}
