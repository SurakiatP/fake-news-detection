In Beijing, the government hopes to eliminate the fuzz forever. \u2022 And we introduce The Long View, in which the historian Jon Meacham looks at books that speak to historical and cultural moments. This first installment looks at the chaotic U. S. of the 1930s. The Oval Office is often used as shorthand for the U. S. presidency, but did you know that fewer than half of the presidents have worked there? During President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s term ( ) the West Wing was added to hold the executive branch\u2019s growing staff. He had a   office in the addition (now called the Roosevelt Room). Earlier leaders worked in the residence, mostly in what is known as the Lincoln Bedroom. Roosevelt\u2019s successor, William H. Taft, had the Oval Office built and was its first occupant. The design wasn\u2019t novel. George Washington had   rooms in Philadelphia in 1791, allowing him to greet guests circled around him. The pomp mimics an English court tradition called the lev\u00e9e. There was a White House precursor, too. The Blue Room is rounded and used for diplomatic receptions. In the family quarters, there\u2019s a Yellow Oval Room. On Christmas Eve in 1929, the Oval Office was badly damaged in a fire. President Franklin Roosevelt renovated it, moving it closer to the residence. The \u201ccommute\u201d is under a minute. Presidents can redecorate, but there are limits. One is that the presidential seal must remain on the ceiling. And there\u2019s an other tradition: the outgoing president leaves a letter on the desk for his successor.
