This is a historic moment to be sure, but there will be no smiling and cheering in Chicago: Fans of the Cubs are still too sad over the death of Princess Diana to do any celebrating. \\n\u201cI honestly never thought I\u2019d see the Cubs bring home the trophy, but everyone here is still too swept up with grief over Lady Di to really enjoy themselves right now,\u201d said Cubbies superfan Raymon Lindley, who was among the thousands of fans who gathered outside Wrigley Field following last night\u2019s edge-of-your-seat game to light candles in memory of the late Princess Of Wales. \u201cIt would be macabre to celebrate the win in light of what happened to Princess Diana on that fateful August night in 1997.\u201d \\nTheo Epstein, the curse-breaking president of baseball operations for the Cubs, has shipped the World Series trophy overseas to Britain, where it is to be laid on the grave of the People\u2019s Princess. While the people of Chicago are undoubtedly proud of their Cubs, no parade has been planned, as the general feeling of the city is that it would be too gratuitous at this time. \\n\u201cI just called my 91-year-old grandfather, who waited his whole life to see the Cubs win the World Series,\u201d said longtime season-ticket holder Karen Hunter. \u201cWe spent the entire call crying about Princess Diana together. She was so young.\u201d \\n\u201cI would give a thousand Cubs World Series wins if Lady Di could be alive for one more day,\u201d Hunter added. \\nHistory has been made, and the Cubs finally have their much-sought-after championship, but fans clearly still have a long way to go before they\u2019re comfortable celebrating the historic achievement. Aside from the occasional outburst of \u201cCandle In The Wind\u201d by groups of bereft fans, Wrigleyville will remain a quiet and mournful place until the Cubs faithful are ready to party with their victorious hometown heroes. And it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to when that will be.'"}, "time": 1742561759.270328}
