Bannon has argued over the years that the civilizational struggle with radical Islam, along with the corrupt crony capitalism of \u201cthe Party of Davos,\u201d the dehumanizing secularization of the West, and the ambitions of emerging superpowers like China, were all converging into a global conflict not unlike the one faced by the World War II generation. The generational theory about \u201cfour turnings\u201d formed the basis for Bannon\u2019s acclaimed documentary Generation Zero about the 2008 financial crisis. The term comes from the book The Fourth Turning by William Strauss and Neil Howe, who argued that American history can be charted in a cycle of four stages, concluding with a crisis period that emerges every 80 years.
