(Frank Franklin II / AP Photo) \\nLess than a day after the third and final 2016 presidential debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump faced new accusations from a woman who recounted a story of her sexual assault at his hands. Karena Virginia told members of the press how Trump groped her in public at the U.S. Open in 1998 while asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d \\nTwo days later, two more women, Kristin Anderson and Summer Zervos, made similar allegations . Earlier this year, a woman named Katie Johnson said Trump raped her in 1994 when she was 13 years old; she filed a lawsuit against him that was later thrown out on a technicality. Trump\u2019s ex-wife, Ivana Trump, has also accused him of raping her. To date a dozen women have publicly alleged that Trump in some way assaulted them. \\nJane Piper, an activist who faced her rapist in court in 2014 , told me in an interview that she believes the women who have accused Trump. \u201cI take their word as their word, and I believe them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have this documented evidence of [Trump\u2019s] attitude and behavior toward women,\u201d added Piper, referring to his numerous public statements revealing a callous and disrespectful attitude toward women. To Piper, the idea that Trump might be a serial perpetrator of sexual assault is consistent with his language and the attitude he has publicly displayed. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nThink about Bill Cosby. While he has not been convicted on charges of sexual assault, in the court of public opinion, he is already considered guilty. He has admitted to drugging women in order to have sex with them, and the sheer volume of accusers against him leaves one wondering: \u201cHow could they possibly all be lying?\u201d As Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace asked Trump during the final presidential debate, \u201cWhy would so many different women from so many different circumstances, from so many different years, why would they all ... make up these stories?\u201d \\nIndeed, in cases such as those involving Cosby and Trump, there is little to be gained by publicly proclaiming oneself the victim of rape and assault. All a woman gains is to be forever known as someone who accused a famous man of a vile crime. According to Piper, \u201cIt is not comfortable to be known in this way. It makes no sense, and it is ridiculous and offensive and insulting\u201d to imply that a woman might make it all up for fame. \\nLike Cosby, Trump has bragged about assaulting women. In a now infamous recording obtained by The Washington Post , Trump revealed to TV host Billy Bush that he simply has his way with women: \u201cJust kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d And, as in Cosby\u2019s case, women are emerging from the woodwork as the election looms to reveal sordid stories about Trump\u2019s alleged assaults on them. \\nOne major difference here is that Cosby is an actor (who will indeed face the accusations against him in court), while Trump is running for the highest office in the nation. While all men, including Cosby, need to be held to high standards on sexual assault, those who run for president deserve the utmost scrutiny. \\nPiper dismissed the response by Trump\u2019s supporters that the timing of the accusations now emerging is suspect. \u201cOf course, this timing is perfect,\u201d she told me, \u201cbecause [Trump\u2019s accusers] just listened to him in that video describe what he did and [be] proud of it, and the next day, in the debate, lie and say that he never ever actually did that.\u201d Piper said that if she had been one of the women who had alleged assault by Trump, she \u201cwould be doing everything in my power to make sure that the public knew what kind of person this man was so that they would know what kind of leader they were choosing to elect.\u201d Essentially, anyone running for president of the United States should expect his or her past and present to be scrutinized under the most stringent of microscopes. \\n\u201cWomanizing,\u201d or having affairs, as presidential candidate Gary Hart was accused of in 1987, is very different from being accused of sexual assault or rape. Hart was brought down by a media frenzy that began with a single, provocative photograph. Trump is heading straight into an election dogged by repeated accusations of crimes\u2014not affairs\u2014and all he has offered are simplistic denials and deflections.'"}, "time": 1742562103.6417575}
