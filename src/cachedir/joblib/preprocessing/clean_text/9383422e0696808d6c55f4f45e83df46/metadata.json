By Jim Hightower Posted on November 3, 2016 by Jim Hightower \\nEvading security cameras in the remote expanse along the U.S. border, three Guatemalans waited till dusk to slip illicitly into our country. \\nThis is the stuff of Donald Trump nightmares\u2014and if he were to witness such a scene, we can only imagine the furious rants that would follow. \\nBut Trump will never see this scene or even know about it, because he\u2019s facing south, fulminating against Mexicans and assuring his faithful followers that he\u2019ll stop illegal entry into the U.S. by building a \u201c beautiful, impenetrable wall \u201d across our 2,000-mile border with Mexico. \\nMeanwhile, the scene described took place way up north, where rural Vermont connects to Canada. As the New York Times recently reported , \u201cThis area is a haven for smugglers and cross-border criminal organizations.\u201d \\nWith so many of our nation\u2019s political and security officials obsessed with the southern border, more and more criminal action\u2014including the smuggling of people, drugs, and weapons\u2014has plagued our 5,500-mile Canadian border, the longest in the world between two countries. \\nRunning from the Atlantic to the Pacific through sparsely populated and heavily wooded terrain, there\u2019s often no clear demarcation of where Canada ends and the U.S. begins. Some farms, homes, and businesses actually sprawl across the border. \\nOnly about 2,000 agents patrol this vast stretch, and officials concede they don\u2019t even have a good guess of how many people and how much contraband is coming across, or where. \\nSo, the question for Mr. Trump is: Shall we wall off Canada, too? And how much of our public treasury, democratic idealism, and international goodwill shall we dump into the folly of militarizing both borders? \\nBy simply thinking we can wall the world out, we\u2019ll be walling ourselves in\u2014and that\u2019s suicidal. \\nOtherWords columnist Jim Hightower is a radio commentator, writer, and public speaker.
