General Michael Flynn (retired) told the Dallas chapter of ACT! For America that \u201cIslam is a political ideology, it is a political ideology. It definitely hides behind this notion of it being a religion.\u201d \\nThe comments are sure to be brought back up when Flynn goes before the Senate to testify during his confirmation hearings. However, Flynn\u2019s personality and his public persona lead me to believe that he\u2019s not worried about facing tough questions from hostile Democrat Senators. \\nIn his speech, Flynn further commented on the differences between Christianity and Islam before making some even more controversial comments about world Islam today. \\n\u201cIslam is a political ideology, it is a political ideology. It definitely hides behind this notion of it being a religion. I have a very, very tough time because I don\u2019t see a lot of people screaming \u2018Jesus Christ\u2019 with hatchetsor machetes or rifles shooting up clubs or hatcheting, literally axing families on a train. \\nOr like they just killed a couple of police officers with a machete. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable. So we have a problem. \\nIt\u2019s like cancer. I\u2019ve gone through cancer in my own life. And so it\u2019s like cancer, and it\u2019s like a malignant cancer, though in this case that has metastasized. \\nIt\u2019s like I just said in the number of attacks in 22 countries in just the last 45 days. When I look back over the last 10 years or 15 years of my life and the things that I\u2019ve seen and the things that I\u2019ve witnessed against this very vicious threat. \\nThe folks at MRC TV cut video of Flynn\u2019s speech with an interview he gave to MSNBC where the topic of discussion was Russia. In the interview Flynn explains why the current liberal stance towards Russia is all wrong \u2013 while Russia may not be a \u201cgood guy\u201d in the narrative, they\u2019re certainly preferable to the Muslim terrorists that we\u2019re both fighting against. \\n\u201cWe have to deal with Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot make Russia an enemy. Russia is a nation that is deeply involved in the Middle East. Right now, the Middle East is totally unstable. We have over 5,000 of our own troops there in Iraq trying to fight the rise of ISIS.\u201d \\n\u201cRussia\u2019s directly involved,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have to figure out ways to work with them instead of making them an antagonist.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564502.2294056}
