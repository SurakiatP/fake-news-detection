If this book was designed to scare the holy shite out of people, it certainly has succeeded. \\nAccording to Scranton, \u201cHuman civilization has thrived in what has been the most stable climate interval in 650,00 years. Thanks to carbon-fueled industrial civilization, that interval is over.\u201d Boom. \\nBut is anybody doing anything to stop this nightmare from happening? Only a few people are\u2014mainly a small-but-courageous Indian tribe at Standing Rock, North Dakota. And what is America\u2019s reaction to this heroic stand against death by carbon? We have just spent hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars trying to tear-gas them, harass them, arrest them, pepper-spray them and shoot rubber bullets at them. Way to go America! Or not. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nThank goodness for the Standing Rock Sioux. Like it or not, they are protecting us. They are standing in place instead of us. They are bravely standing in front of a hurricane of climate-death and are doing it in our name. And all we do to thank them is to pay for the militarized police\u2019s tear gas, dogs and bullets that attack them. \\nI propose another way to thank the Standing Rock Sioux. Let\u2019s all go to Standing Rock this Thanksgiving\u2014and show them that we really do have something to be truly thankful for. \\nPS: If you can\u2019t figure out how to get all the way to the Standing Rock Reservation, then consider having your Thanksgiving dinner in front of the Capitol building in Bismarck instead. Can\u2019t make it there either? How about Thanksgiving dinner in front of the US Congress or the White House. \\nPPS: Standing Rock protestors, Black Lives Matter, various Chicano movements and Occupy are practically the only true Americans these days\u2014Americans who are courageous enough to actually stand up to the US military-industrial complex that is gobbling up the rest of us alive. We should honor these protestors instead of bombing them with tear gas and attacking them with dogs. \\nThe rest of us whine and grieve that we are losing everything\u2014but do nothing to stop it and just go along. \\nPPPS: Aside from being victims of the climate-change hurricane that is now bearing down upon us post-haste, Standing Rock is also just more collateral damage right now (along with Syria, Palestine, Ukraine, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Nigeria, etc.) in the neo-con \u201cwars\u201d for oil. But who knows who the next \u201ccollateral damage\u201d will be? Probably us. \\nJane Stillwater is a freelance journalist, war correspondent, blogger, political Cassandra and author of \u201c Bring Your Own Flak Jacket: Helpful Tips for Touring Today\u2019s Middle East ,\u201d now available on Amazon.com.
