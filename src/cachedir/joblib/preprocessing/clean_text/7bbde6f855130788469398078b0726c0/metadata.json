But neither side said when it would be shut down or what would be done with the people held there. The center, on Manus Island, a rugged, volcanic outcrop, is one of two such detention centers that Australia maintains in the Pacific to house migrants it has intercepted on the way to its shores, a policy that rights groups and the United Nations have criticized. In April, Papua New Guinea\u2019s Supreme Court declared the center illegal, and the governments have held discussions since then about how to proceed. But few details about the future of the 960 asylum seekers being held there were disclosed Wednesday. \u201cA series of options are being advanced,\u201d Papua New Guinea\u2019s prime minister, Peter O\u2019Neill, said in a statement announcing that both governments had agreed to close the center. Australia\u2019s minister for immigration and border protection, Peter Dutton, said the move would not change his country\u2019s refusal to accept asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. \u201cNo one from Manus Island Regional Processing Center will ever be settled in Australia,\u201d Mr. Dutton said in a statement. He has said in the past that asylum seekers granted refugee status could resettle in Papua New Guinea, though few have been allowed to do so, and that those denied asylum should be sent back to their home countries. Australia\u2019s government, which has maintained a   policy toward asylum seekers to discourage migrants from trying the dangerous sea voyage, has said it is for Papua New Guinea to decide what to do with the asylum seekers at the Manus detention center. A senator in the Australian Greens Party, Sarah   said Wednesday that the asylum seekers should be resettled in Australia. \u201cThe government must ensure that these people are given a chance to rebuild their lives in safety in Australia,\u201d Ms.   said in a statement. The conditions at the center, and at another on Nauru, a tiny island nation, have come under scrutiny. The United Nations has said that Australia\u2019s treatment of asylum seekers at the offshore centers is cruel, inhuman and degrading, and that it violates international law. Detainees on Manus Island have contracted malaria and typhoid, and there have been reports of a lack of toilet paper and running water. Guards there have also been accused of brutality and of failing to protect detainees. Conditions at the detention center on Nauru have also been  described as harsh and dispiriting. The Guardian released documents this month from the Nauru center that detailed reports of child sexual abuse, assault and   among asylum seekers. About 1, 000 asylum seekers are living on Nauru. \u201cAustralia\u2019s international reputation has been enormously damaged by the establishment of offshore camps,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Connor, acting chief executive of the Refugee Council of Australia, which represents 200 groups that support asylum seekers. \u201cIt has done enormous damage to the thousands of individuals who have been trapped in this system. The refugees should immediately be brought to Australia. \u201d Leaders of Australia\u2019s governing parties and the main opposition Labor Party have said the country\u2019s   policy has led to a steady decrease in the number of asylum seekers attempting to reach their shores, and the officials have shown few signs of wanting to change the policy.'"}, "time": 1742561660.1024907}
