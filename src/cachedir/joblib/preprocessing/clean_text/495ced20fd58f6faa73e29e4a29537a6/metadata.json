Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. Acne can be an embarrassing problem that seemingly no amount of expensive creams and ointments can resolve. But research suggests that in some cases, what you put in your mouth may be as important as what you put on your skin. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of patients who get their acne under control just by changing their diet,\u201d said Dr. Daniel J. Aires, a researcher and dermatologist at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City. Dr. Aires said that over the years there have been many studies on the link between various foods and acne, and the strongest evidence can be summarized in three takeaways: \u25a0 Avoid sugary and starchy foods that have a high glycemic index, meaning they cause blood sugar levels to rise rapidly. \u25a0 If you eat dairy products, avoid   dairy varieties. \u25a0 Eat plenty of very colorful plants and produce. Some of the most compelling evidence comes from research looking at the relationship between acne and high glycemic foods like sugar, white bread, white rice, pasta and other simple carbohydrates. Highly processed and refined carbohydrates tend to have little or no fiber and generally cause blood sugar levels to spike. (Related: How to form healthy habits in your 20s) Dr. Aires pointed to a study published in July in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that found that diets containing a lot of high glycemic foods were strongly linked to acne. Some small clinical trials have found that cutting back on these foods can help to reduce acne lesions in teenagers and young adults. Scientists aren\u2019t sure why, but one reason may be that high glycemic foods not only cause blood sugar levels to rise but also prompt the release of various hormones, such as insulin,   and growth hormone, which can exacerbate acne. Other research has pointed to a link between dairy products and acne development. But multiple studies have found that it is   dairy in particular that causes problems. Dr. Aires said the underlying reason might also be hormones. \u201cMilk has a lot of growth factors in it which, in general, may be promoting acne,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is that those get more concentrated when you take out the fat. \u201d He tells his patients who eat dairy products to avoid the   options. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to eat cheese, eat the regular cheese,\u201d he said. Finally, Dr. Aires, who is also the director of the dermatology division at the University of Kansas Medical Center, also recommends that people eat foods with high levels of polyphenols, which are plant compounds that help to lower inflammation. Polyphenols tend to be found in deeply colored foods like berries, green tea,   olive oil, herbs, dark chocolate, green vegetables and red wine. So in summary, eat a diet full of real, whole foods without too much sugar or refined carbohydrates  \u2014   and eat plenty of plants and vegetables, Dr. Aires said. \u201cLots and lots of vegetables,\u201d he added.
