For me, it was a marvel. And also sort of a problem. I was a   adolescent who became a college actress who became a theater critic. I don\u2019t really know what to do with myself if I\u2019m not spending a lot of my week sitting in a creaking plush seat, staring up at a stage. You could call this a vocation. You could also call it an addiction. You\u2019d be right. Why the hiatus? My son was born in late June it seemed wise to take some time off. Still, I jokingly told an editor that I\u2019d tried to schedule my delivery for a slow point in the season. This may not have been a joke. I likewise sent an email to a publicist, teasingly proposing theater matinees for nursing mothers. Also not entirely a joke. My leave has baffled my toddler daughter, who\u2019s used to waving me away an hour or two before her bedtime. \u201cMama, don\u2019t you go to shows anymore?\u201d she asked. Even my husband seems a little surprised to see me sitting across from him at dinner. It feels strange to me, too. Luckily, it\u2019s never been easier to enjoy theater without actually going to the theater. I can stream David Tennant\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d online while I nurse, or play the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast album while I rock the baby to sleep. I can download audiobooks of plays to hear while I\u2019m pumping, or listen to radio drama podcasts like \u201cThe Message\u201d or \u201cWelcome to Night Vale\u201d while pushing the stroller. I can go to the library and take out stacks of scripts, including the   \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d which I read   cuddling the baby with the other. He and I might even slip into a movie theater for an encore presentation of a broadcast of \u201cThe Audience\u201d or \u201cA View From the Bridge. \u201d (In truth, I\u2019ve done all of these things, except for sneaking the baby into the cinema, though that day may come. And yes, I\u2019m aware that this is a weird and possibly even mildly pathological way to spend a maternity leave, but once I\u2019d caught up on \u201cUnReal\u201d and read \u201cThe Girls\u201d and a bunch of Lew Archer mysteries, I started to feel a little restless.) These are good options. For one thing, they\u2019re democratizing. Theater is inherently local. It is also often expensive. DVDs and live streams make an experience that was once available to only a few accessible to many, a phenomenon that would have made my preteen self, who used to obsessively play cassettes of original cast recordings of shows I would never see, weep for joy. And they\u2019re a mental workout. Scripts and podcasts excite the imagination even more than live theater, forcing us to picture the characters, the settings, the actions and the gestures. (Which is salutary for those experiencing the synaptic haze of \u201cmommy brain. \u201d) But as grateful as I am for PBS\u2019s \u201cGreat Performances,\u201d Methuen collections of Caryl Churchill, YouTube clips of \u201cChess\u201d (which I can sing, enthusiastically and off key, overture to finale) none of it feels really, properly like theater. What\u2019s missing, of course, is the sense of liveness, the thrill of the present tense. Theater is the art form most like life. Sure, the dialogue is snazzier, and the clothes fit better, but it\u2019s performed by real people, in real space, in real time. A video, however   can\u2019t substitute for that. Theater presents a laboratory for human life that obliges me think about my own  \u2014   my marriage, my family, my ways of moving through the world. It\u2019s why a good play feels meditative, even therapeutic. (I\u2019ll confess that after a breakup, I once wept my way through a Broadway production of \u201cPrivate Lives\u201d and felt a lot better afterward.) I learn about my life by slipping, mimetically, into others\u2019 as they walk and chat in front of me. And I don\u2019t have to meditate alone. Plays ask us to come together to engage with people and relationships presented just a few feet away  \u2014   farther, if you have a balcony seat  \u2014   while still allowing us the privacy that darkness confers. It offers community and anonymity at once. Additionally, a script or a streaming site won\u2019t provide theater\u2019s ephemerality, the sensation that each performance will never recur in exactly the same way. Perhaps this isn\u2019t always meaningfully true. Plenty of productions alter little from one night to the next. But every show depends on the audience assembled. By simply bunching together in the dark, each of us contributes to the event each of us creates it. My    daughter wouldn\u2019t articulate it that way, but I\u2019ve seen her experience it. She loves moments when she\u2019s asked to clap or shout along. My husband and I took her to her first show, Soho Rep\u2019s antic,   kiddie play, \u201cWasheteria,\u201d when she was a year and a half, and she still remembers how the performers reached into the crowd and gave high fives. It\u2019s that scene that\u2019s stuck with her, even as she\u2019s forgotten everything else about the play. As a relatively   adult, I obviously have a somewhat more fraught relationship with audience participation, but on the right night, I can still feel some of her wonder. The opportunity for reflection, the evanescence, the liveness  \u2014   they go a long way toward explaining why, even though I\u2019m usually at the theater four or five nights a week for work, I still sometimes see plays for fun. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to find a performance of some sort on almost every vacation my husband and I have taken. It\u2019s why three or four weeks after my son was born, I started looking up outdoor Shakespeare offerings, searching for something we could see together, with exits all around in case he fussed. It\u2019s why, a few nights ago, my mother and I settled him into an infant car seat, and we all rode through Brooklyn, from Park Slope to a park in Bushwick, which was hosting an evening performance of Dave Malloy\u2019s theatrical song cycle \u201cGhost Quartet. \u201d The park didn\u2019t feel much like a theater. It was breezy there and still warm, with flocks of pigeons wheeling overhead, and hot dog and ice cream carts lining the paths. I was relieved to see that other parents had taken babies. I counted a handful of older children, too. (\u201cGhost Quartet\u201d is wonderfully creepy I hope they didn\u2019t have nightmares.) When the lights turned on, and the show began, I rocked my son from side to side in time to the music. He shut his eyes and nestled against my chest, while I looked up at the makeshift stage, home in the world again.'"}, "time": 1742562340.363848}
