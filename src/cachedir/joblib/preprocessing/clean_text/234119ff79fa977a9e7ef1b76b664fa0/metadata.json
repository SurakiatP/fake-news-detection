It was time to wind down, 8 p. m. Behind her, an embroidered throw pillow announced: \u201cSleep your way to the top. \u201d The phrase recalls a TED Talk she gave in 2010, and it isn\u2019t about sex, thank you. It is about sleeping. \u201cI was making a speech about sleep as a performance enhancer,\u201d she said. \u201cAs opposed to being lazy or not engaged with life. \u201d One wouldn\u2019t think that about one of the most powerful women in the world, the author of 15 books and a founder of a news site that sold to AOL for $315 million in 2011. But of all the things on her agenda, which would exhaust most mortals, sleep is at the top. Her new book, \u201cThe Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time\u201d (Harmony) is a call to bed. It is also inspiring a turbocharged national tour that involves \u201csleep fairs\u201d at colleges and an educational \u201ctakeover\u201d of a JetBlue flight during which she gave out books and answered questions. \u201cI want to rekindle our romance with sleep,\u201d said Ms. Huffington, 65, in a lullaby voice as soothing as her floral perfume. \u201cIt\u2019s a central part of life and a gateway to our dreams. \u201d If sleep is a gateway to her dreams, then her bedroom is the mother ship. It is one of four in a vast apartment she transformed a few years ago with the help of the designer Steven Gambrel. \u201cIt was a minimalist loft,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wanted something that felt more   and European. \u201d To achieve that, she hired Mr. Gambrel to add walls to break up the space, for which he also designed much of the furniture. Peter Mucek, the decorative painter, plastered the walls to emulate a golden Venetian glow. Michael S. Smith, who redecorated some rooms in the Obama White House and is a friend, suggested that she treat the loft\u2019s concrete columns with metallic brown paint to give them an ancient bronze feel. Mr. Smith also designed some leather chairs and an ottoman. Her home now has a regal and romantic ambience that seems in perfect keeping with Ms. Huffington\u2019s personality. Everything in the decidedly   bedroom is as carefully considered as a business move. On a bed surrounded with Fortuny curtains in a restful light blue, she sleeps on organic cotton sheets from a collection called Huffington. The Huffington line, carried by   a nearby bedding shop, was designed by her daughter Isabella Huffington, 25, an artist who shares her home. Her pillows are stuffed with soporific hops and barley. Across the room are two Gordon Parks photographs, including the bucolic \u201cBoy With June Bug. \u201d Over her night stand is a photograph of her other daughter, Christina, now 27, at Isabella\u2019s christening. \u201cI call it a joy trigger,\u201d Ms. Huffington said, \u201cand I like having it right by my bed. \u201d Her night stand functions as a kind of altar to Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. The books are inspirational, including works by Rumi, the   Persian poet, and Marcus Aurelius, whom Ms. Huffington admires because he was a multitasking Roman emperor and not easily ruffled. There is a simple alarm clock from Pottery Barn without any of the pesky digital lights she bans from her bedroom and from her hotel rooms. (She packs masking tape to obscure their blinking.) Roses and peonies rest in a vase by a journal with a black cover decorated by Isabella. Next to it is a pen light. \u201cSo if I wake up in the middle of the night, I can write down my dreams without turning on the light,\u201d she said. Dreams, of course, are welcome business ideas, not so much. On a desk and dresser across the room, which she can\u2019t reach from her bed, Ms. Huffington has several china Herend Rothschild bird bowls to hold such workaday items as   and manuscript clips, and a lacquered box for her packed appointment book. \u201cI hide the whole mess to forget about it,\u201d she said, lifting and setting down lids like a cook. At bedtime, her phone and electronic devices are relegated to the foyer outside the bedroom, to recharge under a wall of family photographs. Withdrawing from her machines, she said, is part of a   \u201ctransition to sleep\u201d ritual that includes writing down the many things she is grateful for dimming the lights taking a warm bath in Epsom salts by flickering candlelight and changing into a silk nightgown to greet sleep with respect. \u201cI used to sleep in the same thing I wore during the day,\u201d said Ms. Huffington, whose call to rest came in 2007, when she fell down from exhaustion and broke her cheekbone. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have special clothes for sleeping. \u201d It also helps to have soundproofed windows, which required a complicated and expensive installation process that made her renovated home as quiet as a church. Indeed, her cellphone rings with the sound of cathedral chimes. \u201cI love church bells, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked in a seductive purr. It was time for a tour of the rest of the apartment. It is one of her two homes and very different from the one she has in California. \u201cMy other house is from the 1920s, in Brentwood, in L. A.,\u201d she said as she swept into her living room. \u201cWhen I step out the door there, it\u2019s into a garden of entirely white flowers, where all I smell is gardenias and it feels like being in the country. Here, it\u2019s children, dogs and people from all over the world on my street when I walk out, and my favorite shops and restaurants. \u201d Her spacious living area  \u2014   with a custom bookcase, a gilded Louis XV desk, gilded bronze and cobalt   candelabra and a   Italian mirror above the fireplace  \u2014   has the feeling of something between a papal chamber and the Oval Office. \u201cIsn\u2019t this beautiful?\u201d she asks, gesturing to a   screen by Mr. Mucek that hides a small white kitchen area, where she doesn\u2019t concern herself with cooking. Just the same, Ms. Huffington loves to hold the many dinners that she doesn\u2019t prepare at a   faux marble dining table. \u201cI know how to make a really great cheese plate,\u201d she said. She makes tea, too. Near the front door is a portrait of a woman by Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, which Ms. Gilot, who spent 10 years with Picasso, gave Ms. Huffington around the time Ms. Huffington was writing \u201cPicasso: Creator and Destroyer,\u201d published in 1988. The portrait of her daughters is by Nelson Shanks, who also painted Bill Clinton, Pope John Paul II and Diana, Princess of Wales. \u201cBut what I love most of all are the works of my daughter Isabella,\u201d she said. As if on cue, Isabella emerged from an art studio next to her bedroom. (Christina has her own place.) The two put their arms around each other. The daughter, as it turns out, also respects a good night\u2019s sleep. \u201cEven in college, I\u2019d get nine hours of sleep a night,\u201d said Isabella, who is as tall and graceful as her mother and whose pretty collages have a dark political edge. \u201cRemember when you\u2019d visit, and my friends were pulling   and you\u2019d lecture them about it?\u201d Her mother laughed. No need for that at home. It was 10 o\u2019clock, and with a television appearance scheduled for early the next day, time to dim the lights and take the moment seriously. \u201cMy sleep ritual is about to begin,\u201d Ms. Huffington said with a beatific smile. She looked to the double doors leading to her bedroom. \u201cMy gateway calls. \u201d The church bells on her phone were ringing. She ignored them.'"}, "time": 1742561663.159953}
