Of course, they won\u2019t announce anything about their investigation during the 60-days before voting finishes on November 8th. Reuters broke the news : \\nBill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans. \\n\u201cI became a villain, quite frankly,\u201d recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. \u201cI got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,\u201d McAnulty said. \\nFollowing the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site. In an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had \u201c made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters .\u201d He declined to discuss the episode further. \\nNorth Carolina Republicans can\u2019t win with ideas, so it appears that they have completely given up on democracy for the sake of winning. Politics isn\u2019t just a popularity contest; our electoral system is rooted in the sacred covenant that everyone has a voice in how our country is run. \\nAs usual, the Republican voter suppression squad turned to the old trope of \u201cwasteful and unnecessary\u201d spending as the illegitimate justification to try and suppress minority votes. \\nIn two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the \u201cparty line\u201d on curtailing the early voting period. \u201cMany of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSix days of voting in one week is enough. Period.\u201d Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period \u201c may be wasteful and unnecessary ,\u201d he added. \\nThe North Carolina Republican Party and its elected officials have set the gold standard for racially-driven dirty politics, and they\u2019re not even slightly afraid to banter with each other openly about it. \\nFortunately, the Democratic Party fought back and while they could not prevent every instance of voter suppression, it has resulted in more early voting access rather than the GOP\u2019s plan of less. \\n\u201cThose who wanted to suppress the vote, they\u2019re going to fail,\u201d he said at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in Raleigh. \u201cRight now, there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before.\u201d \\nWith only five days remaining in the race, North Carolina poll averages show a dead heat between Democrats and their vote suppressing opponents in the Republican party in the presidential race. \\nIf you witness voter suppression at the polls, don\u2019t hesitate to call 866-OUR-VOTE.'"}, "time": 1742563562.9519312}
