[\u201cWhy aren\u2019t the first 100 days a measuring stick for Congress and the Democrats?\u201d Levin said. \u201cCan anyone name one piece of positive bipartisan legislation that Nancy Pelosi and Schumer have put forth?\u201d  As to Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, Levin said he has made some positive moves, despite little assistance from Republican leadership. \u201cThe one area where Trump has succeeded, is in unravelling the executive orders of Obama,\u201d Levin said. \u201dHe is using the same power Obama did to undo what Obama did. \u201d \u201cHowever, the president is having a tough time with the Republican Congress,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThere is no excuse for what Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are doing or not doing. \u201d And, Levin said, this is no time for crossing the aisle to work with Democrats. \u201cIt is time to roll Chuck Schumer and the Democrats,\u201d Levin said. The \u2018Art of the Deal\u2019 should be the \u2018Art of Victory,\u2019\u201d Levin said. CNN reported on the history of the 100 day measurement, which dates back to a president who took over a desperate nation and, thus, a compliant Congress. According to that report: The first 100 days of a   presidency amount to about 3% of an   span, but for decades the opening stretch of an administration has become the barometer of a commander in chief\u2019s governing power, or lack thereof. The measurement began after Franklin Delano Roosevelt entered office amid the tumult of the Great Depression reported. With banks caving in and jobs vanishing, FDR set to work passing laws and establishing new government bureaus to curb the economic suffering. He swore in his entire Cabinet at once, signed 76 bills into law, and began rolling out the New Deal in his first 100 days in office  \u2014   a frenzy of activity that, ever since, all presidents have been matched against. Every president since FDR has had to deal with the   trial, including John F. Kennedy, who used it to his benefit. \u201cAll this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1, 000 days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cBut let us begin!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562010.6545763}
