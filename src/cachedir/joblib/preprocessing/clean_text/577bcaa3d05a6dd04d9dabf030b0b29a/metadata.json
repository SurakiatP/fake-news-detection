Her recent arc on the Fox series \u201cNew Girl,\u201d was, then, an unexpected treat, and she will reappear next season, she said, as a love interest and   comic foil. And she returns as April, the adventurous reporter and stalwart buddy in the sequel \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,\u201d out on Friday, June 3. A case of bronchitis caused her to miss the premiere in New York, where the movie was filmed, but Ms. Fox spoke afterward by phone from Los Angeles about her unambitious career path and her working relationship with the producer and director Michael Bay, who first propelled her to stardom in \u201cTransformers,\u201d and is behind the \u201cTurtles\u201d movies. As a mother of two young sons, with a third child on the way (with the actor Brian Austin Green) Ms. Fox, 30, long ago gave up playing Halo, but she still gravitates toward the fantasy universe. \u201cIf I got sent 10 scripts and one of them was for an action or   or gaming movie, that\u2019s the first one I\u2019m gonna read,\u201d she said. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Is it important for you to play women who are both strong and physically attractive? I don\u2019t get a whole lot of say in terms of character development on movies like these. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m in there helping them write the script saying, \u201cApril should do this, because this is what a real feminist would do. \u201d In terms of what\u2019s available for women to play in general in Hollywood, it\u2019s pretty scarce. You have these stereotypes that still dominate films: the nag, the trophy, the escort. [Laughs.] I haven\u2019t been sent a nag script yet, but I do get plenty of, like, \u201cinteresting stripper. \u201d Or, \u201cShe\u2019s super funny, but she\u2019s also an escort, but that\u2019s what makes it funny!\u201d Would you rather have more say? [On \u201cNinja Turtles\u201d] if I had said, I feel like my integrity is being compromised wearing this schoolgirl uniform, they would listen to that, of course. But that wasn\u2019t something that affected me in a negative way at all. On a movie like this, I don\u2019t mind doing [the scene] as written, but I do do a lot of improv. I\u2019m sort of a   ballsy talker, and so I bring that to the character whenever it\u2019s appropriate to the scene. That never makes it in. How did the \u201cNew Girl\u201d role come about? I don\u2019t watch a lot of television, so I didn\u2019t know about it. They wanted to pitch it to me, and I thought that was so bizarre, because I\u2019m not known for working in television, and not known for comedy, even though I\u2019ve done a couple. And I loved it. I was taken aback by how weird and offbeat and fun [the show] is, and the character falls right in line with how I like to play to my own comedic timing. You\u2019ve said that you\u2019re not very ambitious as an actress. Why not? I know [that] idea is a very strange thing because usually actresses are all ambition, and are driven to achieve and they\u2019re workaholics, for the most part. And I\u2019ve never been that way. I\u2019m not necessarily very passionate about acting per se. I don\u2019t feel validated by being on a set or making a movie. I have a lot of fun making these movies, but it\u2019s not a representation of my innermost being. You and Michael Bay had a public falling out after you compared him to Hitler in an interview. You weren\u2019t in the fourth \u201cTransformers. \u201d How did you mend fences? I had to ride out two years of very negative press. There\u2019s this perception that I was sort of thrown out of Hollywood. The positive thing was that it forced me to be very introspective and go, \u2018You were not totally right in this situation.\u2019 I reached out to him, and we had a very genuine exchange. From that point forward, it was good. What kind of movies would you like to do? I actually prefer doing these kind of movies, which always surprises people because they always assume that everyone wants to be the suffering artist, making these festival pieces. There\u2019s something that\u2019s more athletic about the process of making these movies, there\u2019s more adrenaline involved, there\u2019s more risk factor, there\u2019s more chaos, and so I just find it to be a more exciting experience. These are also the kind of movies that I prefer to watch, because they\u2019re an escape into a supernatural world, which has always been where I prefer to daydream, anyway.'"}, "time": 1742628316.5754874}
