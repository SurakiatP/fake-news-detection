{"duration": 0.12072420120239258, "input_args": {"text": "'Interesting juxtaposition of the week: The AE show \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d announces that the current season will be its last, and Paul Horner, who creates fake news stories on the internet, tells The Washington Post: \u201cMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. \u201d \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d the reality show about the Robertson family of Louisiana and its   business, became a spectacular hit for AE after its debut in March 2012, then a spectacular headache in late 2013 when Phil Robertson, the patriarch, made remarks in a GQ interview that were widely seen as offensive to gay people. At that point the show was averaging nine million viewers a week, an amazing number for a   reality series, but the controversy cost it cachet among some viewers, and ratings have fallen considerably since. Overexposure no doubt also played a role in the show\u2019s decline. Members of the clan became celebrities and started turning up all over the place, and the producers churned out too many episodes too quickly. Even viewers who still loved the Robertsons and their homespun antics may have been tiring of the whole premise. During Wednesday night\u2019s Season 11 premiere, the family announced that the series would end with the finale in April. Don\u2019t bother making a joke about the Robertsons shelving the series so they could join Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration  \u2014   social media was flooded with them by Thursday morning. Sure, that could happen  \u2014   there are certainly enough Robertsons to fill every cabinet post, and Willie Robertson, the show\u2019s central figure, was a supporter of Mr. Trump  \u2014   but this is more likely just an example of a TV show that has run out of gas. Not without leaving a legacy, however. The series helped solidify the idea that distinguishing between real and fake, truth and fabrication, isn\u2019t really important. I spent a day with the Robertsons in West Monroe, La. in the summer of 2012, between the show\u2019s first and second seasons. The series was still building momentum, but even at that early stage, the Robertsons readily acknowledged that their \u201creality show\u201d wasn\u2019t real at all. That\u2019s hardly rare  \u2014   most reality shows are staged or at least steered toward a preplanned result, of course. But the Robertsons were unusual in that they freely admitted it. \u201cGuided reality\u201d is the phrase they used. The episodes didn\u2019t simply follow the Robertsons around in their daily lives the producers would often sketch out the parameters of a situation and have the family live it. What made the show work so well was that the Robertsons, fitting the Eastern elite\u2019s image of hicks, were in fact savvy media manipulators, excellent improvisers and telegenic as heck. And they seemed to intuit that although many of the show\u2019s episodes were obvious setups, no one would care. \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d sensed that viewers would happily embrace the reality that they wanted, even if it was a manipulated or outright invented version of reality. And now, in 2016, we have seen this flexible definition of what\u2019s real carry into the political arena. As Mr. Horner noted, fabricated news articles streamed into receptive minds through Facebook feeds and such were a worrisome phenomenon in the presidential election, and they continue to be. \u201cThe   era,\u201d it\u2019s being called. (Earlier this week, \u201c \u201d was named Oxford Dictionaries\u2019 2016 international word of the year.) Politicians have only recently figured out how to exploit it. The Robertsons and other   dynasties have been doing it for years.'"}, "time": 1742564557.691491}
