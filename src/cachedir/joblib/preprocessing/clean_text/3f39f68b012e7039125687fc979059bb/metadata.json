Why do everybody hate her,\" Dice asks the first woman who replies, \"Because she\\'s a criminal.\" \\n\"She\\'s a liar and I hate her voice,\" another woman tells him, adding, \"Her voice drives me crazy.\" \\nA few more ladies tell Mark that Hillary is a liar, she\\'s terrible, with one woman adding, \"She lost to Obama eight years ago so why is she still running. It\\'s kind of absurd to me.\" \\nThe women also had problems with Hillary\\'s constant scandals, dirty money, bad policies, and her relentlessly playing the gender card. \\n\"I just believe in more personal freedom and less government control,\" one jogger told the host, while another summed it up with, \"It\\'s time for a change, Hillary\\'s out of here.\" \\nExit thought from Dice: \\nHillary Clinton is not a woman. It is a demon. Stop saying \"first female this, and first female that.\" Demons have no gender. \u2014 Mark Dice (@MarkDice) August 31, 2016 \\n'"}, "time": 1742563315.3800042}
