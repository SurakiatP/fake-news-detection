In our enthusiasm, we have closed the gap...dramatically over the last week.\"   \\nDonald Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, the Clinton-obsessed Republican operative, David Bossie, told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos this morning that \u201cthere\u2019s an enthusiasm gap\u201d and that this bit of math Republicans do is Trump\u2019s path to victory on November 8. \\nThis is how the conversation went, per CBS News\u2019 Sopan Deb , as always highlighting the important bits: \\nStephanopoulos was not about to let Bossie get away with the claim about Trump\u2019s tax returns, and hammered him on the issue: \"He\\'s going to release [his tax return] when he is not under audit.\"\u2013 David Bossie, Trump Deputy Campaign Manager https://t.co/Y9xVg0rJIX \\n\u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) November 1, 2016 \\nBossie deflected like a pro. You can see why Trump hired him. \\nAs a corollary to Bossie\u2019s claims, Trump suddenly found himself interested in polls again this morning, tweeting , Wow, now leading in @ABC / @washingtonpost Poll 46 to 45. Gone up 12 points in two weeks, mostly before the Crooked Hillary blow-up! \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016 \\nThe Trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing; elections are not rigged if Trump gets his way, and neither are polls if Trump is leading. Otherwise, it\u2019s all left-wing shenanigans. \\nHowever, even Newt Gingrich isn\u2019t buying the new poll: Washington Post-ABC poll is an absurdity. Trump has not moved up 13 points in the last 8 days.he was NEVER 12 points behind. Ignore polls \\n\u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 1, 2016 \\nAnd what Trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if Johnson and Stein are taken out of the mix: then Clinton leads by +1 . \\nThese latest claims are an absolute sham as Clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and Comey\u2019s email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to Trump\u2019s camp. \\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative , and if there is any evidence of a Clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in Bossie\u2019s own head. \\nDavid Bossie is living proof that Clinton\u2019s \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy is real,\u201d and all the hating on Hillary isn\u2019t going to change the fact that it is Trump who is the crooked candidate, not Hillary Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742564402.526037}
