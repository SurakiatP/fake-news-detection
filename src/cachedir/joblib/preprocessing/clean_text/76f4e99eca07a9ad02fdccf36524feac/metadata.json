British tabloids derided him as \u201cMitt the Twit\u201d and CNN declared: \u201cRomney\u2019s Trip Begins in Shambles. \u2019\u2019 When Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey went on a trade mission to Britain, he was roundly criticized for an errant comment about vaccinations amid a measles outbreak back home. \u201cA Vaccine for Gaffes? Chris Christie Needs It\u201d was the headline in Commentary. Those moments seem quaint when compared with Donald J. Trump\u2019s news conference in Turnberry, Scotland, a day after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Over the course of 40 minutes, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee made pronouncements, predictions and asides that would have set off serious backlash for almost any other candidate. But Mr. Trump seems to be graded on a different curve. Here are some of his more provocative remarks: A reporter asked Mr. Trump about the suggestion from some pundits that both he and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, would be the biggest political beneficiaries of the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. Mr. Trump agreed that Mr. Putin could gain, and could not resist pointing out that Mr. Putin has been kind to him. \u201cI think he will be probably, because I know how he\u2019s been scorned to a certain extent,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding later: \u201cHe said some very nice things about me. I think he probably is somewhat of a beneficiary. \u201d Traditionally, candidates for national office in the United States refrain from insulting their own leaders when they\u2019re traveling overseas. But Mr. Trump, who has bucked almost every other tradition, made no exception for this one. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly dictating to the world what they should do. The world doesn\u2019t listen to him obviously,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama, who was against Britain leaving the European Union. \u201cHe\u2019s embarrassed. \u201d Candidates also historically do not engage in politics about their own races when traveling abroad. Yet Mr. Trump described Hillary Clinton as a puppet for Mr. Obama, pointing to her support for Britain remaining in the European Union. \u201cShe\u2019s always misread everything,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf he said leave, she would have said leave. She does whatever he wants her to do. You know why, but that\u2019s O. K. \u201d Politicians are wary of sounding as if they\u2019re cheering for bad economic news, something that voters tend to respond poorly to. But Mr. Trump said that the diminished pound, which   in value after the referendum vote, could benefit his bottom line at Trump Turnberry, his luxury resort and golf course. \u201cWhen the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with them but there\u2019s nothing to talk about,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Besides, he added, he would rather have advisers who are divorced from recent global events. \u201cI think I want to use ones that haven\u2019t been involved, take a look at what\u2019s happened in the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said.'"}, "time": 1742628576.0541441}
