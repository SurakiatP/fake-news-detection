She began by saying that Hollywood, foreigners and the press are \u2018the most vilified segments of American society right now\u2019. At which point the cameras panned out to hundreds of the richest, most privileged people in American society sitting in the audience in their $10, 000 tuxedos and $20, 000 dresses, loudly cheering this acknowledgement of their dreadful victimhood. She then said that if all the \u2018outsiders and foreigners\u2019 were kicked out of Hollywood, \u2018you\u2019ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.\u2019 Wow. I haven\u2019t heard such elitist snobbery since Hillary Clinton branded Trump supporters \u2018a basket of deplorables\u2019.   \u2026     But putting all that to one side for a moment  \u2014   and if Trump WAS mocking a man\u2019s disability then I agree it was disgraceful  \u2014   let\u2019s move to what Streep said next: \u2018Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.\u2019 At this point, I laughed out loud with incredulity. Not at the words themselves, which are laudable. No, it was at the hypocrisy. You\u2019d be   to find an industry that encourages more disrespect and violence than Hollywood.   \u2026     Read Morgan\u2019s full column at the Daily Mail.'"}, "time": 1742562500.0537746}
