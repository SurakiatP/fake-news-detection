{"duration": 0.09453487396240234, "input_args": {"text": "'In 2014, the   podcast \u201cSerial\u201d began like this: A tipster asked a radio journalist to investigate a murder. \u201c\u201d the new narrative podcast from the creators of \u201cSerial,\u201d kicks off in a similar fashion. This time, the tipster is John B. McLemore, an eccentric antique clock restorer from Woodstock, Ala. The journalist is Brian Reed, a longtime producer for \u201cThis American Life. \u201d When Mr. McLemore tells Mr. Reed that a Woodstock rich boy got away with murder and has been bragging about it ever since, Mr. Reed agrees to head down from New York to check it out. But it soon becomes clear that the homicide story is a bit of a red herring. It\u2019s the hook to get Mr. Reed on the line. Mr. Reed has used a similar tactic to draw his podcast audience into the story, with a teaser for the series that emphasizes the murder. Some \u201cSerial\u201d fans may be disappointed to learn that the crew\u2019s latest offering is not a straightforward whodunit. They shouldn\u2019t be. \u201c \u201d turns out to be much more interesting than that. \u201c \u201d is not another tale of a journalist trying to solve a murder with just a microphone and a little elbow grease, and thank God. Instead, \u201c \u201d transcends the podcast procedural with a destabilizing narrative structure in which one   mystery leads to another, all surrounding Mr. McLemore and his acquaintances. There is that murder, but also a treasure hunt, a land grab and a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Reed\u2019s investigation turns psychological and emotional  \u2014   into how people come to be branded as bad, and the hidden relationships among men in the rural South. \u201c \u201d  \u2014   which is executive produced by Mr. Reed and the \u201cSerial\u201d producer Julie Snyder, with editorial input from the \u201cSerial\u201d host, Sarah Koenig, and the host of \u201cThis American Life,\u201d Ira Glass  \u2014   is not \u201cSerial\u201d Season 3. It\u2019s kind of a podcast spinoff, and it unfolds more like a novel than a   procedural. Mr. McLemore is its beguiling principal character. He\u2019s got a backyard labyrinth, gold buried in an undisclosed location and a literary flair that turns   life into big drama. He\u2019s the peppiest pessimist south of the   line. The \u201cS\u201d in \u201c \u201d is shorthand for a   word  \u2014   Mr. McLemore\u2019s preferred nickname for his hometown. He has a talent for profane rants about civilization\u2019s downfall that he delivers in an Alabama drawl. In one diatribe, he rails against a nation of people who are \u201cwhiny, fat, flabby, out of shape,  \u2019 damn   peekin\u2019 out the windows and snoopin\u2019 around, listening on the cellphones and spyin\u2019 in the peephole and peepin\u2019 in the crack of the goddamn door, listenin\u2019 in the [expletive] Sheetrock. \u201d Mr. McLemore takes a breath. \u201cI gotta have me some tea. \u201d The chief innovation of \u201cSerial\u201d in its first season, which set out to reinvestigate the 1999 murder of a Baltimore high school student, was in the exposure of the inner workings of a journalistic criminal investigation as it happened. (The podcast\u2019s underwhelming second season, which dug into the already   case of the American G. I. Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s desertion, benefited less from that    aspect.) In \u201c\u201d Mr. Reed illuminates a different kind of reportorial experience. Almost every journalist has met people like Mr. McLemore, sources who email you under pseudonyms with tips a little too good to be true. Often they seem to mostly want someone to talk to, and to have their experiences validated by a journalist, whose job, after all, is to decide what\u2019s important and true. Most reporters would stop taking those calls when the story ideas don\u2019t bear fruit, but not Mr. Reed. He finds Mr. McLemore\u2019s life important in and of itself, and a whole world opens up to him. A disappointment of the first season of \u201cSerial\u201d was that so many of its central players refused to talk  \u2014   an understandable response to a journalist\u2019s digging up of a    tragedy already decided upon by the courts. That often made for uncomfortable listening, as these actual people were posited as possible murder suspects on the basis of   claims. Accusations, criminal and otherwise, fly in \u201c\u201d too, but Mr. Reed manages to speak with just about all of the pivotal characters in the story, deftly interviewing them in a way that generates sympathy for their perspectives and illuminates their charms. Meeting these people provides delightful little surprises throughout the narrative: Among them is Uncle Jimmy, who communicates exclusively through shouted affirmations, and a man who divides his life into two eras: before and after the 2005 release of \u201cBrokeback Mountain. \u201d Also, \u201c \u201d mercifully departs from \u201cSerial\u201d by releasing all of its seven episodes at once. The         style of \u201cSerial\u201d and stylistic offshoots like \u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d holds an addictive appeal, but it\u2019s also a risky gambit that rarely pays off. The inevitable   frenzy to help crowdsource the mystery quickly turns the whole exercise into a dehumanizing game. It doesn\u2019t work. Such podcasts often raise high expectations  \u2014   let\u2019s solve a murder, or at least flush out a reclusive celebrity  \u2014   only to end in shrugs. Assembling the whole story before its release frees Mr. Reed to pace out a real narrative, including an emotional twist at the end of the second episode that turns the whole thing upside down. You should probably start listening now before somebody spoils the twist. But then, take your time with the story  \u2014   \u201c \u201d is so much more than its central mystery.'"}, "time": 1742562052.01824}
