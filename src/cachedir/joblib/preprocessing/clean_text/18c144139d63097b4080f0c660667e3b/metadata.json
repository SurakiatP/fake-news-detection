How to build a new anti-interventionist movement Share This \\nIn the midst of an election in which the issues are largely ignored in favor of sensationalism and smears, the anti-interventionist voter is pretty much at sea. Hillary Clinton\u2019s demagogic Russia-baiting of Trump as a Kremlin \u201cpuppet\u201d augurs a foreign policy that will take us back to the arctic winter of the cold war, circa 1950 . On the other hand, the GOP nominee, for all his encouraging \u201cAmerica first\u201d rhetoric and his stated unwillingness to get into another arms race with the former Soviet Union, would likely take us into other quagmires \u2013 ISIS, China, Iran \u2013 and, in any event, cannot be trusted. \\nSo what is to be done? \\nThe first thing is to disabuse yourself of the notion that any politician or political party currently prominent will magically get us out of the business of Empire. This isn\u2019t to say that political action is wrong, or ineffective \u2013 far from it. What I\u2019m saying is that it is up to us to build a movement out of which a new politics of peace and liberty can be nurtured and brought to maturity. \\nOur second task is to take stock of our assets: what kind of shape is the anti-interventionist movement in, and what are our prospects for future growth? \\nThe first part of that question is easily answered: there is no anti-interventionist movement, as such, and there hasn\u2019t been for quite some time. Oh sure, there are scattered organizations and individuals with a public platform, but none of these have a truly national presence. \\nYes, Antiwar.com is one such voice with not insignificant reach, but we aren\u2019t an organization \u2013 we\u2019re a web site. We don\u2019t have chapters, support groups, members, etc., and have quite deliberately avoided setting up any such network for the simple reason that we don\u2019t have the resources to do so. Every movement has different components that specialize in various functions, and our specialty is education. That is, we give our readers the information they need in order to understand the problem, but as far as acting to eliminate the problem \u2013 that\u2019s a mission we must leave to others. \\nThe big problem is that there are no \u201cothers\u201d \u2013 no action groups, no lobbyists, no real grassroots organizations that can respond to events as they occur, and mobilize the public against the War Party. The \u201cmovement,\u201d such as it is, is top-heavy with thinktanks \u2013 the Cato Institute, the Center for the National Interest, the Ron Paul Institute , and the newly-organized student-oriented John Quincy Adams Society come to mind \u2013 and sorely lacking at the grassroots: essentially, a head with no body. \\nThis isn\u2019t because there is no potential for such a grassroots movement: indeed, the objective conditions are ripe \u2013 I would say over ripe \u2013 for such an undertaking. Polls consistently show that the American people are increasingly skeptical \u2013 and that is really too weak a word \u2013 of foreign entanglements, and basically endorse a foreign policy of minding our own business. This sentiment is one major \u2013 and deliberately overlooked \u2013 aspect of the populist \u201cresentment\u201d that catapulted Trump to the top of the GOP ticket and upended the political prognostications of the \u201cexperts.\u201d The idea of putting America first \u2013 instead of, say, Europe, or the Saudis, or whichever country we\u2019re supposedly \u2018liberating\u201d at great cost \u2013 has visceral appeal to ordinary Americans. \\nThe astonishing fact of the matter is that, a few short years ago, the GOP was the spearhead of the War Party, with militant neoconservatives at its head \u2013 and is, today, the party of a man who said we were lied into the Iraq war, who wants to basically dismantle NATO, and who has adopted \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2013 a slogan resonant with historical meaning \u2013 as his campaign theme. \\nWhen I was a kid I used to play a game with a good friend of mine: what would we do if we had a million dollars? Of course, I\u2019m really dating myself, because today, of course, a million dollars is chump change. In any case, this column is basically a reiteration of that game: what would I do if I had the resources to organize a real grassroots anti-interventionist movement? \\nWell, the very first thing I would do is to organize those millions of Trump voters attracted to his banner for precisely the reason the neocons and the foreign policy \u201cexperts\u201d disdain him. Item number one on my agenda would be creating a grassroots America First movement, one with the following three components: \\nThe America First Action (AFA) groups \u2013 the function of this organization is implied in its name. Its mission would be to respond to every move by the War Party to involve us in some foreign war by rapidly mobilizing people against it. At the first indication that such a move was in the works, congressional phone lines would be ringing off the hook with howls of protest. This is what happened when President Obama announced he was going to bomb Syria \u2013 and it worked , with very little central direction. Aside from telephonic harassment of congressional warmongers, AFA would organize meetings, rallies, lecture tours, media appearances, Internet trolling (my favorite!), and every other form of public activity, always focused like a laser on the War Party\u2019s latest scheme. \\nThe America First Political Action Committee \u2013 the electoral arm of the America First movement, AFPAC would help candidates from any and all political parties who oppose foreign wars and entangling alliances. This is one of our greatest weaknesses: currently, the War Party\u2019s tame politicians are well-rewarded for their labors, while pro-peace candidates are routinely punished financially. The military-industrial-congressional complex takes care of its own \u2013 we must do the same. Yes, the war profiteers have tremendous resources but we can best them at their own game by appealing to the millions of Americans who are sick and tired of perpetual war. \\nThe America First Lobby \u2013 while a different name would probably be best, I\u2019m calling it a lobby because that is precisely its function. While practically every foreign government on earth has a Washington-based lobby, which meets with government officials and presses its case for more \u201cforeign aid,\u201d and often direct military intervention on their behalf \u2013 the American people have no such organization, no lobby to pursue and defend their interests. I would take as my model AIPAC, the notoriously powerful pro-Israel lobby, which practically storms Capitol Hill every time Bibi Netanyahu gives the signal. If only anti-interventionist Americans would do the same every time war clouds gather on the horizon, we would put an end to our foreign policy of constant warfare once and for all. \\nThese three components of a newly constituted America First movement would be supplemented by subsidiary groups targeting specific constituencies. First and foremost, what\u2019s needed is a student affiliate \u2013 it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve heard \u201cHell no, we won\u2019t go!\u201d on the nation\u2019s campuses. And what about abolishing draft registration? Hillary Clinton wants to force women to register for the draft \u2013 why isn\u2019t this horrific proposal roiling the student bodies of universities and high schools across the country? \\nAfrican-Americans suffer from our foreign policy of global intervention much more than most others: they are, too often, the cannon fodder that feeds the war machine, and if they return they come home to an economy drained by the diversion of vital resources toward war-making and away from productive job-creating and wealth-creating investment. \\nRacial minorities, women, rural communities \u2013 all these groups suffer inordinately as a consequence of an internationalist elite that sacrifices our sons and daughters on the altar of the war god. They can and must be won over to the cause of peace. \\nSuch a movement isn\u2019t a pipedream. It can be born \u2013 and it can prosper to the extent that it organizes itself according to a strategic vision that unites people of various political persuasions around a single issue \u2013 intransigent opposition to military intervention abroad. \\n\u201cPeace\u201d movements launched by the left have failed because they took a multi-issue approach: each and every leftist hobbyhorse was invoked to the point where the central issue \u2013 war and peace \u2013 was overshadowed. The organizers of these efforts, which have fallen by the wayside by the dozen, thought they were organizing a political party, which is why these movements never got off the ground. The one time they did manage to achieve some success \u2013 the antiwar protests of the 1960s \u2013 was when they junked the multi-issue approach, and focused on the single issue of getting us out of Vietnam. \\nThe potential is there for such a movement today \u2013 but only if we cast aside our preconceptions and prejudices, and work to bring together elements that would naturally tend to split apart. Libertarians and Trumpists, Bernie Sanders supporters and \u201cisolationist\u201d conservatives, students at elite universities and rural folks who object to being used as cannon fodder \u2013 all must be united in a common cause to put America first, and rid ourselves of the albatross of empire. \\nIt can be done. It must be done. But will it be done? I can\u2019t answer that question: what I can say is that you, my readers, have the power to do it. Now, if only you have the will\u2026. \\nNOTES IN THE MARGIN \\nYou can check out my Twitter feed by going here .
