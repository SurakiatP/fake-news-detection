It was no mere boast, since President Trump has publicly stated his affection for the show and for Fox News, the channel on which it airs. If Mr. Trump was indeed tuning in, he was far from alone. Fox News has been the most watched cable news network for 15 years, but depending on the hour, the news narrative it presents to its large and loyal conservative audience can sharply diverge from what consumers of other media outlets may be seeing. We watched Fox News from 6 a. m. until midnight on Thursday to see how its coverage varied from that of its rivals on a day when cable news was dominated by the health care debate in Congress, the terrorist attack in London and the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. One notable way Fox News stood apart from its competition, as it has been known to do for years, was in the stories it chose to highlight and the tone  \u2014   in some of its opinion shows, unapologetically supportive of Mr. Trump and his agenda  \u2014   with which it covered them. There was extensive coverage of the health care vote, for example, but there was also considerable time given to topics, like a rape case in Maryland, that viewers would not have heard about if they had turned to CNN or MSNBC. The rape case, which involved an undocumented immigrant and went virtually uncovered on most networks, received almost hourly updates on Fox, and at times was used as proof that Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for tighter borders and a crackdown on immigration were justified. During coverage of the London terrorist attack, in a break from the rather muted coverage on CNN, \u201cFox and Friends\u201d veered into discussing the faith of the \u201cMuslim mayor\u201d of London. A morning news show noted that most British police officers did not carry guns (a fact that a guest labeled \u201clunacy\u201d) and considered how the attack represented the broader terrorist threat. And while other networks were devoting time to the apology made by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House committee investigating Russian interference in the election, for not sharing information about intelligence with the committee\u2019s top Democrat before giving it to Mr. Trump, Fox was touting a report about \u201cpotential\u201d evidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s team may indeed have been surveilled by the Obama administration. It was presented as vindication of Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier assertions that his phones had been wiretapped. Still, while people who do not watch Fox News may think it presents a uniform voice from morning to night, the network\u2019s content varies plenty. It offers a heavy dose of opinionated fare  \u2014   \u201cFox and Friends\u201d and its entire   lineup  \u2014   and has something closer to a more traditional news format for much of the afternoon. And just like any cable news network, when news breaks, it can find itself scrambling. With all that in mind, if you weren\u2019t watching Fox News on Thursday, this is how the news played out through its distinctive lens. _________ It promised to be an eventful day in Washington, with the debate over the health care bill providing the twists, turns and   negotiations that cable news channels love. But when \u201cFox and Friends\u201d began at 6 a. m. the   Ainsley Earhardt was holding up the gruesome front page of The New York Post. \u201cAnguish, terror strikes in the shadow of Big Ben,\u201d she said, reading the paper\u2019s headline, as the camera zoomed in on a photograph of a bloodied victim. \u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s looking at us,\u201d added Mr. Kilmeade of the cover photo. The crew of \u201cFox and Friends\u201d spent a large chunk of the morning focusing on the London terrorist attack, and updates on the situation kept coming through the morning on the shows \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d and \u201cHappening Now. \u201d Many of these updates came with an underlying message: that the world can be a dark and often dangerous place, and that it is under the threat of \u201cradical Islamic terror,\u201d as was said with emphasis on \u201cFox and Friends. \u201d (That phrase is one that Mr. Trump proudly and frequently uses.) The message of fear would resonate throughout the day, in the London coverage and later in segments on the Maryland rape case. \u201cPolice say the attacker was   but many say this attack highlights the importance of properly vetting immigrants and refugees,\u201d said Ed Henry, a substitute host on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom. \u201d Mr. Henry later said to a panel of guests, \u201cIt seems to me that it\u2019s harder and harder for Democrats to say that the travel ban doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201d On \u201cHappening Now,\u201d an interview with Danny Coulson, a former deputy assistant director at the F. B. I. centered on the \u201clunacy\u201d of not equipping police officers with guns, words that echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about security guards after the nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Kilmeade repeatedly turned his focus to London\u2019s \u201cMuslim mayor,\u201d Sadiq Khan, calling on him to discuss the difference between his faith and that of the attacker. \u201cFox and Friends\u201d also spent time on comments that Mr. Khan made in 2016 about how terrorism preparedness was \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of living in a big city. After the attack this week, Donald Trump Jr. wrote a Twitter post about Mr. Khan\u2019s comments and was roundly criticized for taking them out of context. \u201cFox and Friends\u201d did not note that. _________ As the day progressed, more time was given to covering the health care bill. The 6 p. m. and 11 p. m. editions of the news show \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d hosted by Bret Baier, along with \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d and \u201cHannity,\u201d spent significant portions of their broadcasts discussing the bill and its fate. But with the bill in trouble, there were several conspicuous stretches when health care, seemingly the top news story of the day, disappeared from the Fox News airwaves. The vote on the bill, which had been scheduled for Thursday, was postponed around 3:30 p. m. Still, it took Tucker Carlson, whose show comes on at 9 p. m. 45 minutes to address it. On Fox News\u2019s 7 p. m. show, \u201cThe First 100 Days,\u201d which is supposed to focus on, well, the president\u2019s first 100 days, the bill barely registered 10 minutes of airtime. The panel of the 5 p. m.   show \u201cThe Five\u201d discussed the bill and the vote in the program\u2019s first 10 minutes before moving on to topics like surveillance, the London attack and a segment on Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. (One panelist, Kimberly Guilfoyle, complained that \u201call the garbage isn\u2019t collected\u201d in her neighborhood.) Mr. Carlson\u2019s attention was on immigration, and his guest, Ann Coulter, opined that Mr. Trump should focus on immigration and a border wall. It wasn\u2019t the first time the wall was mentioned. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d Fox\u2019s midmorning show, devoted an entire segment to the wall Mr. Trump says will be built along the Mexican border. The coverage featured graphics, talk about how companies would bid for the chance to build the wall and a discussion about potential requirements for the structure, like \u201cwithstand assault,\u201d \u201cunclimbable\u201d and \u201caesthetically pleasing on the U. S. side. \u201d _________ \u201cSince other networks are determined to ignore it, we open tonight with more coverage of the horrific alleged rape in Rockville, Maryland,\u201d Mr. Carlson said at the start of his show. All week, Fox News had been covering a story of a    Maryland girl who said she had been raped by two of her high school classmates, one of whom is an undocumented immigrant. The way the story was discussed throughout the day on the network was not unlike a Trump campaign speech: criticism of the mainstream media, accusing it of having a liberal agenda that prioritizes identity politics over safety proclamations that sanctuary cities and states are rife with danger from illegal immigration mentions of Kathryn Steinle, the woman killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco in 2015 who was often invoked on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and other conservatives and descriptions of a border so porous that there are \u201cwaves of unaccompanied children coming across. \u201d The Maryland case was a topic on Fox News from the morning to almost midnight. The coverage was also laced with critical comments aimed at other networks for not giving the case enough attention. \u201cIn my mind, they\u2019re telling our little girls that this little girl\u2019s life doesn\u2019t matter as much as these illegal immigrants\u2019 lives matter because they don\u2019t want to spread a negative story,\u201d Ms. Earhardt, referring to other news outlets, said on \u201cFox and Friends. \u201d (Howard Kurtz, the network\u2019s media analyst, said that Fox\u2019s   shows had dedicated more than 53 minutes of attention to the case  \u2014   and that rival morning shows and evening newscasts had virtually ignored it.) The \u201cFox and Friends\u201d   Steve Doocy introduced a segment on the case by saying: \u201cWhere\u2019s the mainstream media\u2019s outrage? Hmm, we couldn\u2019t find it. \u201d On \u201cThe Five,\u201d the panelist Greg Gutfeld said the case wasn\u2019t being covered sufficiently because it didn\u2019t fit the media\u2019s \u201cliberal feminist narrative. \u201d Ms. Guilfoyle deemed it a \u201cshameful blackout. \u201d A guest on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d Ed Martin, bluntly stated that \u201cthey\u2019re raping and killing our people, and that\u2019s what Trump won on. \u201d _________ Even as Fox latched on to stories on Thursday that were not being emphasized on other networks, its afternoon hours hewed closer to traditional news coverage. For instance, Fox showed all 50 minutes of Sean Spicer\u2019s White House press briefing, just as CNN and MSNBC did. And when Fox\u2019s 3 p. m. anchor, Shepard Smith, came on, skepticism of the president ramped up. Mr. Smith has an evenhanded reputation that sets him somewhat apart from his colleagues in the minds of some, but the unpopularity of the health care bill was mentioned throughout the afternoon. During Fox\u2019s 2 p. m. hour, a National Journal editor, Josh Kraushaar, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s brand would be \u201cundermined somewhat\u201d if he could not get the votes for the bill. On Neil Cavuto\u2019s 4 p. m. slot, after the vote had been postponed, The Post\u2019s Daniel Halper said that Mr. Trump\u2019s low approval ratings gave him \u201ca lot less leeway\u201d with members of the House. Mr. Smith called Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he had been wiretapped by the Obama administration \u201cunfounded. \u201d He even asked a guest, \u201cIs there a longtime danger from this that maybe his followers don\u2019t understand or haven\u2019t thought about?\u201d While Mr. Smith was on the air, the House decided to delay its vote on the health care bill until Friday, prompting Mr. Smith to say, \u201cFor this to go down in flames, according to analysts on both sides of the political aisle, would be very bad for this White House. \u201d _________ The ability of different Fox News programs to lurch between news and opinion was demonstrated clearly when it came to Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California. On \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d Mr. Baier said that Mr. Hunter was under investigation by the Justice Department for misspending campaign funds. Less than two hours later, Mr. Hunter, along with Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, appeared live on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d to discuss the health care bill. Mr. Hunter argued that the bill would \u201csave America. \u201d Eric Bolling, who was filling in for the host, Bill O\u2019Reilly, did not raise the investigation with the congressman. _________ While the London attack, the Maryland rape case and critiques of the media moved to the fore during certain stretches, an implicit defense of Mr. Trump was also a consistent theme. Mr. Cavuto dinged the media for being too harsh on Mr. Trump. \u201cIf you want to be liked by the media, you better be like the media, which means these days you better not like Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Cavuto said, noting that the president had boycotted his show. He added of the media, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s time to get over Trump  \u2014   I\u2019m saying it\u2019s time to get over yourselves. \u201d And even though Mr. Trump\u2019s first push for major legislation was in peril by the end of Thursday night, the mantra from numerous Fox hosts and analysts was: Don\u2019t blame him. Mr. Hannity started his 10 p. m. show by denouncing Republicans in the House, saying they were \u201cill prepared for this moment to lead, and now they failed the president. \u201d The Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs appeared on the show and specifically called out Speaker Paul D. Ryan for proving \u201che\u2019s not a leader. \u201d (That sentiment was not particular to Fox. Lawrence O\u2019Donnell opened his 10 p. m. show on MSNBC by saying that Mr. Ryan had \u201cfailed his first big test as speaker. \u201d) Earlier in the day, Mr. Bolling  \u2014   who appeared on \u201cThe Five\u201d before filling in on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d  \u2014   said of the bill\u2019s troubles, \u201cMake no mistake, this is on Paul Ryan, not Donald Trump. \u201d Ms. Guilfoyle echoed that, saying, \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be because of a lack of effort from President Trump. \u201d Earlier, on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d Mr. Henry was quick to draw a comparison with Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor. \u201cThe criticism of Barack Obama, for so long, he wouldn\u2019t get his hands dirty, didn\u2019t like dealing with Congress  \u2014   this president is getting his hands dirty,\u201d Mr. Henry said. While some other networks were at the center of controversy last year for hiring some people with very close ties to Mr. Trump, Fox News remains the home for his defenders. A list of the guests who appeared on the network on Thursday includes Mr. Spicer, Jerry Falwell Jr. the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and the British   politician Nigel Farage. Mr. Huckabee and Charlie Gasparino of Fox Business Network both said they would be perfectly pleased if Mr. Trump turned to tax cuts and moved past health care. As Mr. Trump weathered the fallout from his claim that he was wiretapped by Mr. Obama, numerous guests discussed recent unverified reports that some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s team were surveilled by the Obama administration. Mr. Farage appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d to heap praise on the president after the reports, made public by Mr. Nunes. \u201cFor Donald Trump to use a term like \u2018somewhat vindicated\u2019 is mastery of understatement, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mr. Farage said. \u201cI should think he\u2019s pleased that he has been proved to be right. \u201d Mr. Kilmeade later said that this was not the first time the president had been vindicated after making a comment that others criticized. \u201cSweden, same thing,\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s comment that immigrants were causing crime in Sweden, something even Mr. Trump himself later clarified. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Sweden? Nothing\u2019s going on with Sweden?\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said. \u201cA week later, there are riots and people are talking about what\u2019s actually going on in some of those ghetto areas. So those are areas on which he spoke out, and he ended up being proven right here. \u201d Throughout the afternoon, a countdown clock previewing Mr. Carlson\u2019s show made a promise: \u201cTrump Team Surveillance EXPOSED. \u201d Nothing of the sort came up on the 9 p. m. show for the first 30 minutes, but Mr. Carlson, along with Mr. Hannity and other hosts, mentioned a report by the Fox correspondent James Rosen that a potential \u201csmoking gun\u201d could be coming. As the night wore down, and in the aftermath of the delayed health care vote, Mr. Hannity turned his attention fully to this latest topic. He even went so far as to ask a guest on his show whether this could \u201cmake Watergate look like kindergarten. \u201d To find that out, you would have to tune in again.'"}, "time": 1742562198.4651675}
