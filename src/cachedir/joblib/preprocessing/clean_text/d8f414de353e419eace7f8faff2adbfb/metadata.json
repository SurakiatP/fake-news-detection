Hit critiques takes on extra bite in the context of the rise of racism and xenophobia, misogyny, and the crassest brutality, in the United States. It would do everyone well to wake up and carefully look at what is happening to the left. P eople all over the world are fed up with capitalism. They don\u2019t always know how to formulate their aversions anymore (the result of a confusing \u2018education\u2019 and disinformation campaign pouring out of the West), but intuitively they are increasingly longing for socialism or even Communism; definitely for some humane, compassionate system based on social justice, kindness and anti-imperialist principles.\\nSuch sentiments are everywhere, in countries as diverse as the Philippines and Bolivia, South Africa and Kirgizstan. \\nThe rulers and propagandists in the West are well aware of this \u2018dangerous trend\u2019, and they are trying to reverse it with increasing determination \u2013 even with brutal force. \\nIn the past, they used to simply try to fully ideologically discredit all socialist and Communist thoughts. Billions of dollars were spent on propaganda and disinformation, on \u2018re-education\u2019 of the masses in all corners of the globe, on targeted scholarships and tactics aimed at dividing the Left. This approach was successful, but only to a certain degree. All over the world, the leftist revolutionary ideas would lose some ground for a while, but then they would re-emerge again, often under some new labels and banners. \\nLately, the Empire has begun changing its strategy. Instead of trying to contain its main adversaries, it has decided to exterminate them \u2018intellectually\u2019 once and for all. And how better to do it than by what it always does the best \u2013 by spreading confusion, nihilism and chaos! \\n* \\nInstead of attacking socialism and Communism directly, the Empire has begun its massive campaign to discredit most of the countries that are being governed by left-wing governments and movements. This is of course by itself nothing new. What is \u2018innovative\u2019 is that this time Western propaganda has actually began arguing that the anti-imperialist countries are essentially not left wing at all, that they are more capitalist than the West itself, that they are \u2018anti-people\u2019, and sometimes even fascist. \\nNew derogatory and thoroughly grotesque terms like \u2018state capitalism\u2019 have been invented and put to destructive work. These terms have then been repeated so often that they have become normalized, and eventually been adopted by the Western \u2018soft left\u2019, the liberal media and academia, as well as by the countless \u2018progressive\u2019 but anti-Communist movements \u2013 including anarchists. \\nWhile I was told by some of the greatest revolutionary figures like Eduardo Galeano and Pramoedya Ananta Toer, that it is time for \u2018un-dusting the old flags and symbols\u2019 (and they were clearly talking about the socialist and Communist ones), the Western official propaganda and much of the Western \u2018left\u2019 were busy spreading their vitriolic but contagious doctrines that \u2018the labels\u2019 should be once and for all declared obsolete. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of any political party or any movement\u201d, one hears increasingly from millions of couch and cafe revolutionaries in cities like London or Paris. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be labeled\u201d. Or typically so in those places: \u201cI have my own mind\u201d. \\nExcept where there are no structures, no strong organization, no labels or flags, there can be no true victory. \\nBut who cares about victory? Soon it became clear that the \u2018progressive\u2019 Western \u2018opposition\u2019 was not truly seeking to take power or to implement real revolutionary changes. It wanted to \u2018improve things at home\u2019, instead of abolishing the entire monstrous world order. It felt cozy and comfortable being a toothless discussion club, hating everything that was truly fighting, risking life while trying to stop imperialism and the Empire from devouring the Planet. \\nThus was born the grand quiet alliance of the Western establishment (the Empire), the liberals and of those undefined (or of loosely defined) movements like the anarchists. It was directly antagonistic to almost all the countries where the Left was by now holding power. It \u2018distrusted\u2019 leading revolutionary figures. Needless to say \u2013 the criticism of the world revolutions has been based strictly on Western liberal values and doctrines. \\nThose countries that decided to face the Western Empire were generally labeled as un-democratic, as being arch violators of human rights. Socialist nations became the main target of the propaganda. Their every move has been scrutinized, each error blown out of proportion. Grotesquely, the West was, as mentioned above, now criticizing them for \u2018not being socialist enough, or socialist at all\u2019. It is because the demagogues in London, New York and Paris knew perfectly well that socialism, even Communism, is once again, for many people all over the world a great asset, not liability. \\nIn the meantime, millions of \u2018purists\u2019 from the pseudo-Left in the West got engaged in endless and pointless theoretical debates about what was or not true socialism and Communism. \\n\u201cIs socialism, the Chinese way, truly socialism?\u201d they are repeating, like parrots, all over Europe and North America. \u201cIs Russia socialist at all, or is it governed by a strongman and by a bunch of selfish oligarchs?\u201d And of course: \u201cHow socialist are countries like Iran or South Africa?\u201d \\nThe verdict of the purists is always extremely stern. Almost nobody manages to survive the scrutiny! The purists in the West don\u2019t hold power, and it is apparent that they don\u2019t really want to. They bark. They philosophize. They throw sticks into the wheels of those who are truly and determinedly fighting for a better world. They ridicule the revolutions and any powerful left-leaning state. \\nVictorious and actively militant anti-imperialist governments and nations make them feel irrelevant, obsolete, embarrassing. \\nAnd the Empire knows it. It understands. It uses the soft Western left against the arch socialist and Communist enemies. \\nIt is using soft left effectively because it is selfish, cowardly and it lacks discipline. But above all, because it is self enamored. \\n* \\nAnd so, in great unison with the Western Empire\u2019s palace propagandists, the soft Western anti-Communist \u2018left\u2019 is arguing that the governing Left all over the world is not really true left, that the countries that call themselves socialist are in fact more capitalist than the West, and the world can only be saved by some extremely vaguely defined and abstract system of collective production means (unrealistic and utopian, as nowhere except in the West and in a handful of countries inhabited by European descendants, like Argentina, would such concepts be supported by the masses). \\nThe new alliance is against China, Russia, South Africa, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Eritrea; it is basically against all countries that are still opting for an independent, anti-imperialist course. \\nAll these countries are \u2018wrong\u2019. All of them are brutally \u2018oppressing their people\u2019 and in almost all of them the local \u2018oligarchs are more brutal than in the West\u2019. \\nYou look closer, and it\u2019s all manipulation and lies, or at best half-truths. However, \u2018falsehoods repeated a thousand times have a tendency of becoming the truth\u2019, as an \u2018icon\u2019 of German Nazism explained many decades ago. And so it goes\u2026 \\nFabrications are sinking deeper and deeper into the sub-conscience of the people, in the West but also in countries that are being targeted. Nobody dares to protest, to scream loudly: \u201cNonsense! These countries are actually socialist!\u201d \\nWhat eyes are seeing and what the brains are conditioned to \u2018conclude\u2019 are suddenly two thoroughly different things. \\nThe strategy of the Western Empire is clear: it makes things thoroughly confused, too complex to understand, lacking in transparency. \\n\u201cCapitalist China, right-wing Russia, anti-black South Africa, state-capitalist Venezuela, monolithic and Fascist DPRK. Who would want to follow their examples? Better to accept the familiar Western fundamentalist capitalism and imperialism\u201d. That\u2019s what the world is being maneuvered into thinking. \\nBrilliant indoctrination strategy! Except\u2026 Red flags, fresh from being washed, are proudly waving all over the world, once again. In China and Russia, in South Africa and in so many other places, people are proudly returning to the old labels. \\nNot everyone can understand, anymore, but many are still able too feel, instinctively, and as a result of these basic human impulses, a violent clash between depressing deceit and simple human desires and dreams will soon become imminent. \\nOriginally published by NEO . \\nAndre Vltchek Philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist, Andre Vltchek has covered wars and conflicts in dozens of countries.
