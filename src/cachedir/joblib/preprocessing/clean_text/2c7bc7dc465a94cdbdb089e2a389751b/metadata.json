Fittingly, given YouTube\u2019s ambitions, the scripted series will be based on \u201cStep Up,\u201d the   dance movie franchise that started Channing Tatum\u2019s acting career and has taken in more than $650 million at the worldwide box office. Lionsgate will supply a full season of 10 episodes, each running about 45 minutes  \u2014   a long way from the quickie cat videos for which YouTube was once known. \u201cBigger, bolder\u201d and an offering that will \u201cdrive subscription\u201d is how Susanne Daniels, YouTube\u2019s global head of original content, described the   series in an interview. Kevin Beggs, Lionsgate\u2019s television chairman, called it \u201ca distinctive, noisy,   series\u201d that \u201cmultiple networks wanted. \u201d Mr. Tatum will be an executive producer of the drama, expected to arrive next year. It will cost several million dollars per episode to make, signaling the arrival of YouTube Red as a   buyer of content. The series, which will feature YouTube stars as dancers and actors, will be set at a performing arts high school and be most similar in tone to the first of the five \u201cStep Up\u201d movies. For $10 a month, YouTube Red offers   viewing of videos, exclusive programming and a vast selection of music. Ms. Daniels, best known for turning the WB network into a youth powerhouse in the 1990s, joined the company a year ago and is charged with finding YouTube Red\u2019s version of Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent\u201d or Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d  \u2014   a breakout series that will sell subscriptions and send a message to Hollywood\u2019s creative community: This is a viable place for your best show pitches. The verdict is still out. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said in an   conference call in April that YouTube Red had been \u201cvery well received. \u201d But the company has not released user numbers, and some analysts have been unenthusiastic, especially as more streaming competition has arisen. Hulu, HBO, Netflix, Fullscreen, Go90, Seeso and Amazon, among others, are all pursuing this turf. \u201cIt is hard to tell whether the effort is succeeding or will succeed,\u201d Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a client report last month. \u201cIt is possible that it might be too little too late. \u201d Notably, Mr. Kirjner cited a lack of \u201c   content\u201d as one of YouTube Red\u2019s shortcomings. Ms. Daniels acknowledged in an interview that she was walking \u201ca fine line\u201d with programming decisions. YouTube Red\u2019s original lineup must feel familiar to ardent users of the site (teenagers and young adults) while offering something distinctive enough to convince them to upgrade from YouTube\u2019s free service. So far, efforts have included \u201cA Trip to Unicorn Island,\u201d a documentary about a world tour taken by a YouTube personality, Lilly Singh, and \u201cFoursome,\u201d a high school comedy. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s going to resonate,\u201d Ms. Daniels said. \u201cYou just have to sort of jump in the water. \u201d Still, the \u201cStep Up\u201d project represents a very educated guess. \u201cDance videos on YouTube drive millions of hours of watch time every month,\u201d Ms. Daniels said, adding that dance is a popular genre for YouTube around the world. YouTube Red is available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and has plans for overseas expansion, particularly in Europe. Music videos are also enormously popular on YouTube  \u2014   the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies are known for their   montages  \u2014   and some of the biggest traditional television hits of the last decade, including \u201cEmpire,\u201d \u201cGlee\u201d and NBC\u2019s live musicals, have been rooted in song. Mr. Beggs of Lionsgate said that Ms. Daniels was able to nab the series in part because she was willing to commit to a full season without first making a pilot episode as a test. \u201cThat got everyone\u2019s attention,\u201d he said. The deal got its start at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at the Los Angeles home of Erik Feig,   of Lionsgate\u2019s movie division. Ms. Daniels was among the guests. That night, \u201cErik said the studio was getting ready to talk to distributors about a \u2018Step Up\u2019 TV show, and so I immediately started my hot pursuit,\u201d she said. More than most other Hollywood studios, Lionsgate has been early to spot the promise of streaming services as buyers of   television shows. Lionsgate\u2019s production roster includes \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d for Netflix and \u201cCasual,\u201d which was renewed on Hulu for a third season. (The   \u201cMad Men\u201d is still Lionsgate\u2019s   series, however.) Will \u201cStep Up\u201d provide the studio with another television hit, the kind that mints money by running multiple seasons? It is too early to say, of course, but Mr. Feig, who has been involved with the \u201cStep Up\u201d franchise from its beginning, has high hopes. \u201c\u2018Step Up\u2019 has always relied on a relatively simple formula, one that has managed to work again and again in different contexts, with different actors,\u201d Mr. Feig said in an email. Combine innovative choreography with \u201cthe most current   tracks and an   dollop of   fantasy, and it\u2019s an instant party,\u201d he said. \u201cOne that is destined to leave you maybe not all that wiser, but definitely in a better mood. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563664.212754}
