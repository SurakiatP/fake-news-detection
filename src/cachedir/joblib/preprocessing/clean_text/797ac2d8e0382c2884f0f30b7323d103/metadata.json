Asked whether there was \u201csomething special\u201d about suing UC Berkeley, the home of the Free Speech Movement, Dillon answered: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be on the same side of an issue as Willie Brown, Bernie Sanders, Bill Maher, Keith Ellison, and every other person who\u2019s a lawyer. Now, there are some amateur lawyers, like Howard Dean, who looks up a case on the Internet and then thinks he\u2019s a Supreme Court scholar  \u2014   and, you know, some of our members of Congress who play lawyers on TV, apparently. But no, I think I don\u2019t know any lawyers, serious lawyers practicing constitutional law, who think that this is appropriate. \u201cAnd I have had dozens and dozens of emails and calls from lawyers who don\u2019t know me, around the country. They all start with, \u2018I don\u2019t support what Ann Coulter says, but,\u201d you know, or, \u2018I hate what Donald Trump stands for, but you\u2019re absolutely right on this, and this cannot stand.\u2019 \u201cAnd nor should it stand if it were happening on a conservative college campus and it were liberal students whose views were being marginalized. \u201d She noted that her passion for free speech issues was born when she was a student at Dartmouth, when some students were expelled for criticizing a music professor in print. \u201cWho represented us in the hinterlands of New Hampshire? The American Civil Liberties Union came in to represent my colleagues on the Dartmouth Review. \u201d She remarked, in that context, that the ACLU\u2019s absence at Berkeley was noteworthy. As Breitbart News noted last month, Dhillon once served on the board of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the ACLU. She is a noted Trump supporter, and serves as the vice chair of the California Republican Party. She is reportedly under consideration to be named to lead the Civil Rights Division of the U. S. Department of Justice. Dhillon is also representing Trump supporters who were attacked by   rioters outside a Trump rally in their lawsuit against the city of San Jose for failing to protect them from the mob. Critics say the ACLU has been drifting in a left direction for many years, often abandoning its absolute adherence to basic civil liberties in favor of a   redistributionist, and   concept of rights.
