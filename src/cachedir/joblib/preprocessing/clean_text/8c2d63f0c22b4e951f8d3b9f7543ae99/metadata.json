[\u201cI know one other senator who\u2019s already confided to me that he was surveilled by the Obama administration, including his phone calls,\u201d he told Fox News on Friday.  \u201cSo when this all comes out, if there are political figures from the opposition party, it\u2019s a story bigger than any of the allegations with regard to Russian collusion,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, Paul announced that sources have told him that he has been surveilled by the Obama administration, and that he has requested information from the White House and the congressional intelligence committees on whether he has ever been surveilled, unmasked, or searched for in intelligence reports. \u201cIt\u2019s about your own government spying on the opposition party, that would be enormous if true,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the truth. We\u2019ve asked the intel committees, House and Senate, and I\u2019ve also asked the White House, because there is this whole discussion of Susan Rice unmasking people,\u201d he said. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was fired in February, after a phone call he had with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak was leaked to the Washington Post. Listening in on an American\u2019s phone calls is illegal without a warrant, but it can happen legally during surveillance of a foreign target. If Americans are caught up in surveillance of a foreign target, their identities are supposed to be \u201cmasked,\u201d or concealed. However, U. S. officials can request to have their names unmasked if it is necessary to understanding the context of the communications, with the approval of the agency conducting the surveillance. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper revealed that last year, 1, 934 Americans\u2019 names were unmasked. Last month it was reported that Susan Rice had unmasked Trump campaign officials  \u2014   which she has not denied, but only claimed that it was not illegal. \u201cThere was no reason for her to unmask people. Hers was not a position of investigation. Hers was a political position. And for her to get involved with unmasking Trump officials is alarming. If it happened to other people, it\u2019s even more alarming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to try to get to the bottom of this. And it\u2019s a very secret world. You have to realize that it\u2019s a world so secret most members of Congress are never allowed. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562938.6105685}
