In most other political systems, he would be a  . Yet in a France under terrorist threat, Nicolas Sarkozy may be the man of the moment in a presidential race picking up steam. By hammering on the idea that France\u2019s \u201cidentity\u201d is being challenged at a moment of deep unease over terrorism, the mercurial Mr. Sarkozy may be on to something with the electorate. This past week, his new book put \u201cidentity\u201d front and center in his new campaign. It quickly climbed to the top of a popular   list, outpacing even the season\u2019s novels. As is typical with such instant books, Mr. Sarkozy used his hastily written extended pamphlet to announce his candidacy. He will run in his    party\u2019s November primary, he said. And he is consistently strong in polls. At a rally in a sweltering auditorium in France\u2019s south late last month, his first of the campaign, Mr. Sarkozy got his loudest cheers when he conflated the fight against terrorism with the fight for France\u2019s identity. \u201cFrance is under threat,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cFrance is a target. War is war. We\u2019ve got to win. We\u2019ve got to crush our enemies, render them harmless. \u201d As the crowd in Ch\u00e2teaurenard cheered, Mr. Sarkozy announced, \u201cOur identity is under threat. \u201d By \u201cour identity,\u201d it is clear he means   France. Mr. Sarkozy is positioning himself as its No. 1 defender against weak Socialists and competitors on the right. With his exclamations, Mr. Sarkozy is all about ensuring that next year\u2019s presidential campaign will be fought largely over the threat from Islam, real and perceived. Already, he has touched a nerve with voters. For months, the calm, cerebral and moderate mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9, with his soothing talk of a France at ease with what he calls its \u201chappy identity,\u201d has been considered the   easily pushing Mr. Sarkozy and the bedraggled Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, way back in polls. Mr. Jupp\u00e9 is still the favorite, but he is losing ground in his own party. The new polling numbers suggest as much: Mr. Sarkozy gained four points last week in one widely watched measure and two points in another, nipping steadily at Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s heels. In one of the polls, he was nearly 40 points ahead of Mr. Jupp\u00e9 among voters in their party, the Republicans. Mr. Sarkozy recently said he would introduce a law banning the burkini, the   swimsuit worn by some Muslim women, and it has not hurt him. Anything but. Even on the French left, the burkini has few defenders. The Socialist government\u2019s female ministers have been quick to say they are against it, even when they do not support a total ban feminists have published diatribes against it in the French news media. Mr. Sarkozy characteristically pushes it a step further. \u201cThe burkini is a political, militant act, a provocation,\u201d he told Le Figaro magazine. He calls for locking up,   Muslims who are potential security threats, with thousands of them in the government\u2019s files. Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s appeal, to preserve republican values and the rule of law, seems less in tune with the voters in France\u2019s moment of sustained tension. With Marine Le Pen, the leader of the   National Front, oddly silent after its defeat in local elections in December and largely absent from public debate, Mr. Sarkozy seems intent on scooping up both the Front\u2019s   xenophobic electorate and more centrist   voters who, like much of France, are still in a state of shock after a wave of terrorist attacks. So far, he appears to have the wind in his sails. How is it that Mr. Sarkozy  \u2014   a politician who left France\u2019s chronic economic problems intact after five years in office, embarrassed it with a messy personal life, and wound up being interrogated by investigators over party finances and other matters  \u2014   appears to be coming back so strongly? Much of it has to do with France\u2019s     political system, said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a political scientist at the Institute of Political Studies. Such a system leaves little opening for outsiders and newcomers. Those who are strong in their parties can almost always be guaranteed a long political life. If you are already in the club, you stay in it. Even in defeat, Mr. Sarkozy maintained firm control of his Republicans, not stepping down from their leadership until he announced his candidacy on Aug. 22. And although the French president is directly elected, not chosen by Parliament, the office exists in the shadow of the country\u2019s long parliamentary tradition, Mr. Grunberg said. In that tradition, \u201cthe fact of having been beaten did not mean the end,\u201d he said, with prime ministers and other top leaders often recycling themselves after losing crucial votes. But perhaps more important, Mr. Sarkozy may be the politician most in tune with the country\u2019s unease. He is certainly the loudest, pounding even more explicitly than Ms. Le Pen the themes of secularism and the need to oppose the influence of Islam. \u201cThe Republic has retreated too far,\u201d Mr. Sarkozy says in his book. \u201cNobody should be allowed any external sign of religious affiliation. \u201d He adds that it is \u201cnot with religions that the Republic has problems, but with one of them. \u201d In the face of the terrorist attacks, Mr. Sarkozy projects aggression and pugnacity where Mr. Hollande merely looks stricken and concerned. Among the voters, \u201cSarkozy responds to a demand for authority\u201d in a \u201cvery tense, dangerous situation,\u201d Mr. Grunberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s decided to go very far to the right. And Jupp\u00e9 hasn\u2019t said anything, though now he is beginning to speak. \u201d Whether Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s \u201ctranquillity\u201d in the face of the threat can sway voters  \u2014   Mr. Grunberg believes it might  \u2014   is an open question. Mr. Sarkozy, he pointed out, remains unpopular with a broad portion of the electorate.'"}, "time": 1742628600.0726347}
