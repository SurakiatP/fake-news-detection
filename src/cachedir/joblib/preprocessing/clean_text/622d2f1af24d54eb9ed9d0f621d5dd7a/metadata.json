But the news media\u2019s obsession with things Donald Trump has said consistently overshadows things Hillary Clinton has actually done. \\nRevelations have now surfaced that Clinton backed the Puerto Rico Debt Relief Bill , a plan to help the financially struggling U.S. commonwealth deal with a $70 billion debt it managed to rack up, after a top Clinton fundraiser \u2013who just happens to be a lobbyist for the Puerto Rican treasury\u2014 emailed his brother to discuss the situation. \\nWho is this brother? None other than John David Podesta, Chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign. \\nThe brother, Tony Podesta, has been well-compensated by Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican treasury department has paid Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman\u2019s brother\u2019s firm nearly two million dollars! \\nThe email in question is from March 2015. At that point Puerto Rican treasury had already paid Tony\u2019s firm, The Podesta Group, the $1.9 million since enlisting the firm\u2019s services, whatever those are, in 2013. How does a government $70 billion in debt cough up $1.9 million to pay a consultancy firm, and what consulting or services was that firm providing? Specifically. \\nTony Podesta, serving as President of The Podesta Group, emailed his brother with a subject line of \u201cPuerto Rico.\u201d The body of the email asked, \u201cCan you call me today re PR. Need advice not action.\u201d At the time Tony Podesta and other lobbyists in the firm were pushing for passage of congressional legislation to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt through a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing. \\nA few months after the email between the Podesta brothers, Clinton officially backed congressional legislation authorizing Chapter 9 proceedings. Amazing timing. \\nSo Hillary formally backed legislation to relieve Puerto Rico of billions of dollars in debt after her campaign manager\u2019s brother emailed him seeking \u201cadvice\u201d and after his client had paid him $1.9 million for \u201cservices.\u201d \\nWhat could those services be? Could they be\u2026 using one\u2019s connections in Washington to help see to it the passage of a debt relief bill is assured? \\nIf this doesn\u2019t sound like influence peddling, read on. \\nIn addition to being her campaign manager\u2019s brother, Tony Podesta is a high-dollar Clinton donor and fundraiser. According to Federal Election Commission filings he has provided \u201c reportable bundled contributions \u201d of about $200,000 for the campaign. \\nHe has also donated between $25,000 and $50,000 to \u2013surprise, surprise\u2013 The Clinton Foundation. Is there anyone too shady for this foundation to accept cash from? \\nHow many instances of cash contributions to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for favors, \u2026allegedly\u2026 have there been now? One can barely keep track. We also just learned (also through Wikileaks) that the government of Qatar gave the Clinton Foundation a $1 million check for Bill\u2019s birthday . \\nWhy would a foreign government, any foreign government, let alone one in the Middle East, give a million dollars as a birthday gift? The secrecy, corruption, payoffs and general level of suspicious activity that surrounds this couple is astounding. \\nExactly what the Podestas talked about isn\u2019t known, but other hacked emails show that Clinton specifically asked her staff to craft public statements in support of Puerto Rican debt relief after the Podesta brothers apparently discussed the issue, but before Hillary publicly backed Chapter 9 proceedings. Could it be that some of that $1.9 million made it into Clinton Foundation bank accounts? \\nCongress eventually passed and the president signed a Puerto debt relief package. As of this writing, neither the Clinton campaign nor the Podesta Group had responded to requests for additional information. \\nThis cozy, cash-laden exchange typifies exactly what Donald Trump has tapped into. Americans by-and-large believe there is so much corruption, so much cronyism, so many snakes in the grasses around Washington that everyone is on the take, everyone is into someone\u2019s pockets and the entire brood is wallowing around in the muck of get-rich politics. Wikileaks having hacked John Podesta\u2019s email account and putting this information into the public domain only confirms the suspicions. \\nOf course the other suspicion is that our \u201cmainstream media\u201d is equally corrupt and will not cover stories like this one. Sadly, the American public is mostly right on both counts.'"}, "time": 1742562630.1002333}
