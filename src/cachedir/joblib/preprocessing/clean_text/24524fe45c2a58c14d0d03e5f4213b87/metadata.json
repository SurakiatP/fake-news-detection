[When Redditor bystander007 calculated that unlocking everything in the game would require either over $730 in microtransactions or 2. 5 years of gameplay, the community effectively burst into flame. Most people would frown on spending $60 in microtransactions for a    title spending over $700 in a title that already cost $ $220  \u2014   depending on which edition was bought  \u2014   wasn\u2019t received particularly well, to say the least.  For Honor Director Damien Kieken responded to the concern in an interview on Ubisoft\u2019s Warrior\u2019s Den Weekly Livestream (at the 24 minute mark). His answer? Players were never supposed to unlock everything in the game in the first place.  Kieken said that the team \u201cnever had an intention for you to unlock everything in the game,\u201d adding that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t really make any sense. \u201d He described For Honor as a PvP fighting game with \u201cRPG mechanics\u201d layered on. He then compared the dynamic to MMORPG World of Warcraft, asserting that \u201cyou would never try to unlock everything for all the characters. \u201d There are problems with this analogy. First, that is neither how most RPGs nor most fighting games work. Second, For Honor is hardly an MMO like World of Warcraft in all but the broadest definition of the term. Kieken went further: \u201cWe forecasted that most players would play one to three characters. And that\u2019s what we see today in our game. Most players focus on one character, one hero, and others go up to two or three heroes. All of the design is based around that. \u201d But all that really tells consumers is that the pricing structure has been arranged to make each unlockable item as expensive as possible within the time they spend playing. Kieken went so far as to compare the cosmetic items to endgame content, like the rewards for World of Warcraft\u2019s   activities. If you don\u2019t like it, Kieken suggests you simply change your expectations. \u201cCompletionist\u201d players could focus less on their ability to gain tangible rewards or progression and more on reaching \u201creputation one\u201d level on all heroes and working from there. The For Honor community remains less than impressed by the response. While the game is certainly fun to play, it has committed the cardinal sin of pushing successively more elaborate   and then stuffing the game full of microtransactions to supplement its otherwise glacial progression.
