Hundreds of protesters have joined the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in their effort to block construction of the pipeline they say threatens water supplies and sacred sites. On Thursday, protesters clashed with police officers who began to push them from land owned by the pipeline developers. More than hundred people were arrested, authorities said. One woman allegedly fired shots at officers while being placed under arrest, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. Read our primer on what\u2019s going on with the oil pipeline. And here\u2019s what we\u2019re reading about the project and the region\u2019s history. Here\u2019s what happened on Wednesday . \\nUpdate, 10:25 p.m. \\nMore than 12 hours after protesters started clashing with authorities Thursday, the disturbance is still going. No serious injuries have been reported. \\nNumerous law-enforcement agencies are involved. In addition to the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department, other North Dakota city and county agencies have responded, as well as the highway patrol. Also, officers from Wisconsin, South Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota, Nebraska and Indiana are in the area. \\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs is here to assist tribal nations. \\nThe Associated Press captured this video footage of authorities making arrests earlier in the day. \\n\u2014 The Associated Press and Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 10:05 p.m. \\nThe Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department now say 141 people have been arrested. \\nThe total number of arrests has grown throughout the day, since authorities began pushing protesters from private land owned by the pipeline developers. \\nThe department said protesters set fires to numerous vehicles, three pieces of Dakota Access Pipeline equipment and a bridge. The extent of total damage was unknown. Protesters also reportedly threw rocks, bottles, logs and homemade firebombs at officers. They also locked themselves to items. \\nSome people were arrested on suspicion of reckless endangerment, the department said. Others were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to endanger by fire or explosion, engaging in a riot and maintaining a public nuisance, according to the department. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 8:20 p.m. \\nAuthorities\u2019 operation earlier Thursday to move protesters off private land, which the pipeline developer owns, included agencies from six states, as well as from the local area. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 6:50 p.m. \\nAuthorities say 117 people have been arrested as of 6:15 p.m. PST. \\nDonnell Hushka, a spokeswoman for the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department, said Morton County will use other jails to house people. \\nThose who were arrested on suspicion of misdemeanors can bond out, she said, but those facing felonies will be held for initial court appearances. \\nEarlier, protesters started two fires on a bridge and threw Molotov cocktails at authorities, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. \\n\u2014 The Associated Press and Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 6:15 p.m. \\nNear the clashing scene between protesters and authorities \u2014 which resulted in more than a dozen arrests Thursday and one woman allegedly firing shots at officers \u2014 residents nearby are giving their take on the demonstration. \\nKen Wressler, 66, a retired steelworker, says he was glad to move back into the house in which he was born here after working in the steel mill in nearby Mandan for more than 30 years. \\nEarlier Thursday, standing on his porch to have his morning coffee, he said he doesn\u2019t much see the sense of blocking the $3.8 billion oil pipeline under construction through four states by Energy Transfer Partners of Dallas, Texas. It cuts a swath of freshly-turned ground just a mile from his house. \\nThe construction is protected by razor wire on a highway overpass, a reminder of the protests that have drawn international attention, about a half hour from Wressler\u2019s house near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. \\n\u201cThey ain\u2019t bothered us here in St. Anthony,\u201d Wressler said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid something is going to happen for the worst. If they are not going to move and they are going to get moved,\u201d he said of protesters now encamped in the path of construction. He said the sheriff \u201cshould have taken a stronger stance from the beginning, but who knows?\u201d \\nNorth Dakota needs the pipeline, he said. As a former steel worker, he knows the value of the oil industry. \\n\u201cDuring the first boom, in 1989, we made tanks and more oil tanks and more tanks.\u201d Today? \u201cWhat good is oil to North Dakota if we can\u2019t send it somewhere? What do we want to get it from the Arabs? We see how many problems that gave us.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s been a good life, Wressler said, in this faded town, that used to have two schools, a lumber yard, grocery store and a post office. The bigger town of Mandan, up the road, sucked off the jobs and population. But he values the roots he feels deep in this ground. His father used to work in the shed next to his Wressler\u2019s house, as a blacksmith, fixing farmers\u2019 tools. \u201cHe pounded and fixed everything, until they moved to throwaway scythes, throwaway everything.\u201d \\nWressler\u2019s red plaid flannel shirt with white plastic pearl snaps was all he needed to be comfortable on this fall morning. \u201cEverybody wanted an early winter. The pipeline people wanted it, so the Indians would leave, the Indians wanted it so they couldn\u2019t put in the pipeline. Instead, we\u2019ve got this.\u201d \\nHe shook his visitors\u2019 hands goodbye with a meaty hand. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 5:20 p.m. \\nA woman allegedly fired three shots at law enforcement officers during their operation to force protesters off private land, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. \\nCecily Fong, a spokeswoman for the department, said the woman was being placed under arrest when she pulled out a .38-caliber pistol and fired, narrowly missing a sheriff\u2019s deputy. Officers did not return fire, Fong said. \\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear exactly when the incident happened. \\nAuthorities took the woman in to custody. \\nPopping noises that some in the crowd thought was gunfire can be heard in this Facebook Live video produced by Atsa E\u2019sha Hoferer during the protests. It\u2019s unclear whether this video captures the shooting incident reported by police. Popping noises that some in the crowd thought was gunfire can be heard in this Facebook Live video produced by Atsa E\u2019sha Hoferer during the Dakota Access pipeline protest. \\nUpdate, 5 p.m. \\nA spokesman for protesters said they will continue efforts to block the project, despite being forced from a camp Thursday afternoon. \\nCody Hall says protesters likely will set up a new camp to the east, on federally-owned land that\u2019s also in the path of construction. \\nThe main camp of the protesters is on land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. That agency has taken no steps to evict protesters from that camp, citing free speech reasons. \\nThursday\u2019s eviction by authorities targeted protesters on private land owned by the pipeline developer. About 200 law enforcement officers launched the operation midday Thursday. On Wednesday, the demonstrators refused to leave voluntarily from the camp. \\nHall believes it won\u2019t be as easy to move the protesters off a new camp, if it\u2019s on federal land. \\n\u2014 The Associated Press \\nUpdate, 4:25 p.m. \\nAuthorities say they have ousted the protesters from a camp they had set up on land owned by the pipeline developer. \\nMorton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier says authorities will maintain a presence in the area to keep protesters off private land and prevent them from blocking a nearby highway. \\nLate in the afternoon, Kirchmeier said the camp was secure, though officers were still dealing with some protesters in the surrounding area. \\nNorth Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple said the effort was \u201cwell-handled from start to finish\u201d and resulted in no serious injuries. He said the protesters were given \u201cmore than ample time\u201d to move on their own, and that those who didn\u2019t leave voluntarily needed to be dealt with \u201cas we have.\u201d \\n\u2014 The Associated Press \\nUpdate, 4:05 p.m. \\nMedics say they have treated a tribal member who was hit by an ATV, as well as tribal members who were hit by pepper spray. \\nAlso, medics said they have helped a tribal member who was hurt by a falling horse. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 3:50 p.m. \\nAn estimated 250 demonstrators are still at the north camp and about 80 more, with a dozen horses, are at county road 134. \\nOn that road, protesters have set an area on fire near a bridge, according to the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. They also have burned tires on Highway 1806, the office said. \\nIn a prepared statement, Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said, \u201cLaw enforcement has been very methodical in moving ahead slowly so as not to escalate the situation.\u201d \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 3:22 p.m. \\nSixteen protesters have been arrested, according to the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department. No further details on the arrests were immediately available. \\nLaw enforcement officials are using pepper spray, bean-bag shot guns, concussion grenades and mace to move the demonstrators out of a camp that sits on private land. They have also deployed Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD), which make piercing noises. \\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline purchased the private land to complete its nearly 1200 mile-long pipeline. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 2:59 p.m. \\nProtesters have set tractors on fire. \\nAmbulances from the Standing Rock tribe are standing by to help protesters hurt in the clashes with law enforcement. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 2:45 p.m. (Pacific Time): \\nA herd of buffalo was seen surging over the prairie, bringing cheers from the demonstrators. They flowed over the ground like fast moving water, finally disappearing over the distant hills. \\nMeanwhile, a man named Tubs, of northern Ohio, said he was maced four times and struck with a club. He headed to the medical tent. \\nPolice on all-terrain vehicles are chasing demonstrators on horseback, kicking up a cloud of dust. A helicopter also pursued. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 2:32 p.m.: \\nAlfred Kills His Horse, 27, of the Lakota Nation, said he was standing on the front lines and was shot by a bean bag from a shotgun. \\n\u201cThe water is everything to us. I don\u2019t understand why this chaos is coming to us. We all drink water,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the violence. I don\u2019t want to get shot. We don\u2019t know any other way. We have been fighting the U.S. government for hundreds of years.\u201d \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 2:09 p.m.: \\nProtesters on horseback are galloping toward the front-line of the demonstration, wearing gas masks. \\n\u201cThey started advancing on our lines,\u201d said Dana Yellow Fat, Standing Rock Sioux tribal councilman. \u201cThey opened up a big gash on a man.\u201d \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 1:58 p.m.: \\nPolice are advancing with armored-personnel vehicle and ATVs. Campers are surrounded and outnumbered. Seven empty buses are en route while police move in. \\nSome protesters have locked themselves onto a pickup truck. \\n\u201cYou will be pepper sprayed if you do not get off of the pickup,\u201d an officer said through a megaphone. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 1:42 p.m.: \\nPolice continue to work to clear the protesters\u2019 camp on land owned by the Dakota Access Pipeline developer. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 1:23 p.m.: \\nDarryl Lies, from Douglas, North Dakota, said he came to the standoff \u201cbecause of the violation of private property rights. And the use of one right to trample another is an abuse of our God-given and our country-given rights.\u201d \\nLies is president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. \u201cThey are using the First Amendment right to trample private property rights,\u201d he said. \\nLies said the protests have harmed the relationship between farmers and ranchers and the tribe. \\n\u201cWe just want this to go away,\u201d he said. \\nTrent Loos, 50, of Loup City, Nebraska, said the protesters crossed the line when they went onto private property. \\n\u201cThe sheriff has executed his rights as he should. He has not caved to federal pressure,\u201d he said. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 12:46 p.m.: \\nPolice continue to push demonstrators south down the highway toward the protesters\u2019 main camp about a half mile away. The front-line camp is owned by pipeline developers. Opponents began moving the camp there in the path of construction last weekend. \\nThe first arrest on Thursday was made there as police encircle the camp, moving closer and closer, foot by foot. \\n\u201cWe need as much people as possible. They started spraying (pepper spray). They are pushing tents down,\u201d said Devin Blackcloud, a Standing Rock tribal member. \u201cNo one is budging. There are 150, 200 people willing to be arrested.\u201d \\nSome campers are running. Police pursued. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 12:30 p.m.: \\nPolice are moving protesters south on Highway 1806. Over the megaphone, police are saying: \u201cPlease move to the south. I am going to sound the alert tone. You guys are too close to the vehicles. Please move. \u2026 We do not want to arrest anyone. We are moving forward a few feet.\u201d \\nA line of demonstrators has formed, facing the oncoming riot gear-clad officers and their armored-personnel carrier. Police are also fanned out in the surrounding fields and many more are standing by a short distance away up the hill. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 11:57 a.m.: \\nBack at the main camp, south of the confrontation with police, the mood is hushed, subdued. Black smoke is still rising from the highway barricade that was set on fire. The camp dogs have begun howling. \\nTimes photographer Alan Berner cut his head on barbed wire during the flurry of activity earlier. Medics assisted, and his wound was cleaned. He declined stitches or staples and is headed back to the front line of demonstrations near the property owned by the pipeline developers. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 11:30 a.m.: \\nField medics have arrived to the scene of the faceoff between protesters and riot gear-clad police. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 11:15 a.m.: \\nA helicopter is circling low. Police in armored-personnel carriers and in riot gear are moving in and a showdown is coming. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 10:57 a.m.: \\nPolice officers in riot gear ordered protesters to leave their camp, erected on private property. The protesters then set aflame the barricade they had built on the highway. Thick black smoke billowed from the blockade. \\nChildren were being taken back to the main protester camp nearby, on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers property. Bulldozers are at the ready. \\n\u2014 Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter \\nUpdate, 10:22 a.m.: \\nThe Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Office has warned protesters at their new camp erected on property owned by the pipeline developers to leave \u2014 or be arrested. No one is leaving. Demonstrators are rushing to the front line of the protest. A helicopter is circling overhead. \\nA police officer shouted over a megaphone, over and over, that protesters should take their personal belongings and leave: \u201cWalk to the main camp; 0pen the road block. We will not hurt you. You need to come out with your hands raised. Come onto the road. Do not go into the field. Do not approach us with horses. Do not approach us with vehicles.\u201d \\nProtesters are locking arms, praying and drumming and burning sage, waiting to be arrested. \\n\u201cDisperse now or you will be arrested under North Dakota laws,\u201d police ordered, as protesters sing. \\nLive videos from the scene show a line of officers approaching the protesters\u2019 highway blockade, which appeared to have been set on fire.

S. also creates small-town divisions, where some business owners near the protest camp have plenty to say on the subject. They declined to give their names publicly, though, for fear of sending away customers. \\nIn the tiny town of Solen, which is on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and about a half hour\u2019s drive from the protest camps, some business owners are walking a difficult line. \\nFor instance, a non-Indian garage owner is married to a Sioux woman who sides with the opponents \u2014 while he finds the whole controversy a nuisance. \\n\u201cI think most of the people around here, Native and non-Native, would like to see it end. It\u2019s a big inconvenience. All the traffic, the cops. I am for the pipeline. North Dakota is an oil-producing state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the safest way to transport it.\u201d \\nAt home, the dividing line is clear. \u201cShe is convinced the pipeline is going to break and people are going to die,\u201d he said of his wife. \u201cShe\u2019s got her view, and I\u2019ve got mine.\u201d \\nUp the dirt road, off the main highway, is the Last Chance Saloon, decorated with branding irons, large, longhorn cattle horns and solid advice on a bumper sticker stuck on the wall: \u201cWhen in doubt, let your horse do the talking.\u201d \\nThe barkeeper, age 89, was similarly opinionated with the couple \u2014 yet circumspect. \\n\u201cI wish it would end; I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d she said, pouring fresh coffee for visitors into Styrofoam cups. \u201cAnd they keep coming, more and more.\u201d \\nA lifelong resident of this farming hamlet, she comes in to clean the bar every day for her son and mind the counter during the slow hours. \\n\u201cWhat else am I going to do, sit and look out the window? I like to stay busy.\u201d \\nAs for the coffee, it was hot, fresh and free. She wouldn\u2019t take payment, no. Not from out-of-town visitors. \\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me argue,\u201d she said. \\nOther nearby residents fear the pipeline protests will turn violent, like Ken Ressler, of St. Anthony, N.D., who\u2019s worried someone will be hurt.
