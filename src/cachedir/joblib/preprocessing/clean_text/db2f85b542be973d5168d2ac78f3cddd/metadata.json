By Darrell Lucus on November 13, 2015 Subscribe Colion Noir ( image courtesy NRA News) \\nWhen the National Rifle Association says something, you can almost take it to the bank that it\u2019s going to be outrageous. But even by those standards, a host on NRA News has really gone off the deep end. He\u2019d like us to think that if you\u2019re a gun owner, you have to endure the same hardships as racial minorities and LGBT people. \\nColion Noir is the host of \u201cNoir,\u201d a Webcast that has been on the air since 2014 on NRA News. It\u2019s part of an NRA push to bring its message to minorities and millennials. To give you an idea of just how out of touch the NRA is on this, the NRA began this astroturfing campaign soon after Sandy Hook. \\nOn the November 10 edition of his show, Noir claimed that people of color, gays, lesbians, and transgenders aren\u2019t the only ones who have the right to claim minority status. No, no\u2013according to this host, gun owners are minorities as well. Watch here. \\nNoir claims that the Second Amendment is what protects minority rights in \u201cthe land of the minority.\u201d As he sees it, if you support gun rights, \u201cyou\u2019re fighting for the right of people who disagree with you\u201d to own a gun. However, Noir shoots himself in the foot when he boils his argument down to one sentence: \u201cMajorities by definition accept the status quo. Minorities change it.\u201d \\nReally, Colion? Then why were efforts to reform our gun laws in this country derailed after Sandy Hook, even in the face of overwhelming majorities demanding that the status quo be changed? Oh, that\u2019s right\u2013because the NRA had the power to strike fear in the hearts of enough Senators that the measure couldn\u2019t get 60 votes for cloture. \\nMedia Matters\u2019 Timothy Johnson points out that Noir\u2019s argument falls flat on several other counts. For one thing, gun ownership is not something you\u2019re born with\u2013it\u2019s a choice. There is also no evidence that gun owners have ever faced the level of \u201csystematic and institutional discrimination\u201d that racial minorities and LGBT people have had to endure. \\nI did some digging on Noir, and found out he\u2019s more or less made to order for the NRA. According to The Daily Beast, his real name is Collins Idehen. Most of his videos are standard agitprop typical of an NRA host. When his show premiered last year , it didn\u2019t take long for it to turn into the usual NRA rants about how Hillary Clinton and Mike Bloomberg want to take our guns. \\nTo give you an idea about the kind of person Noir/Idehen is, he once claimed that Martin Luther King, Jr. was pro-gun because he tried to get a concealed-carry permit after someone firebombed his house in Montgomery. What Noir/Idehen doesn\u2019t tell you is that soon afterward, King concluded that he could not serve as the leader of a movement based on nonviolence when he himself had a gun. He got rid of the gun that he owned, contenting himself with posting unarmed guards at his house around the clock and not traveling alone. He realized that \u201cI was much more afraid\u201d when he had a gun in his house than when he didn\u2019t have one. \\nAs it turns out, this urban myth has been floating around the gun lobby for a long time. Just because a black host says it doesn\u2019t make it any less unhinged and inaccurate than it would from the mouth of Wayne LaPierre. The fact that the NRA considers someone who spews such easily debunked claptrap to be its \u201cGreat Black Hope\u201d and \u201cGreat Millennial Hope\u201d tells you all you need to know about the NRA.
