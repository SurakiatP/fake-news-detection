We\u2019re not going to sit and watch\u2026 The way they encircle Mosul shows they would like these terrorists to move into to Syria\u2026\u201d \\nRT reports: \\n\u201cThey\u2019re navigating terrorism from one place to another, limiting terrorism in one place, directing it to another place. That\u2019s the absolute truth of what is happening in our region,\u201d she explained. \\nWestern states only \u201cspeak about fighting terrorism\u201d and in meantime supply so-called \u201cmoderates\u201d who eagerly share Western aid with not so \u201cmoderate\u201d militants, according to the aide. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, Western partners speak about fighting terrorism, but they honestly do not. Quite the contrary, what they do on the ground is to supply weapons and armaments to terrorists whom they call \u2018moderate\u2019, while we know that on the ground there\u2019s no \u2018moderate terrorism.\u2019 They all exchange weapons and armaments on the ground. And they all constitute danger not only to Syria, but to the region and to mankind as well,\u201d Shaaban said. \\n\u201cWe see Western countries announcing that they will be supporting what they call \u2018Syrian moderates\u2019. There are no \u2018Syrian moderates\u2019, they are carrying on butchering people. Those are not \u2018moderates\u2019 for sure.\u201d \\nA never-ending storm in Western media, which are trying to diminish all the counter-terrorism efforts of Damascus and its allies, is a deliberate campaign that started at the very beginning of the Syrian crisis, Shaaban said. It was always \u201cabsolutely incredible, full of lies and falsifications\u201d and totally \u201cirrelevant to reality.\u201d \\n\u201cOne of the great challenges we\u2019re facing in the 21st century is the Western corporate media, that is no longer a media that depends on investigation, or cares about its credibility, or cares about the truth. Give me the names of Western journalists who are on the ground on Syria and who are actually looking at what is happening and reporting to Western people\u2026\u201d \\nThe attempts to pin the alleged airstrike on an Idlib school on Damascus or Moscow is one of the most recent examples of that campaign. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, which debunked the Idlib \u201choax,\u201d the latest smear campaign is waged with a purpose to diverse the attention of international community away from the \u201cwar crimes committed by the US-led coalition\u201d during the Mosul offensive. \\nThe US-led coalition and the US itself proved to be very untrustworthy partners in battling terrorism, unable to live up to their pledges, she said. \\n\u201cRussia signed an agreement with the United States and the United States was not able to implement its own agreement\u2026 The Pentagon prevented the White House from implementing an agreement.\u201d \\nFollowing Friday\u2019s meeting between Russian, Iranian and Syrian diplomats, Shaaban said Damascus is interested in attracting additional \u201ccredible\u201d partners to the alliance, in order to battle the \u201cmost challenging\u201d issue of our age. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an alliance against terrorism, we\u2019re in a war against terrorism, we have so many joint interests among our countries. \u2026 [The meeting was] focused on what is the best way to try and gather more regional and international forces to truly and honestly engage in a battle against terrorism, as we all understand that terrorism is the most challenging issue for the humanity in the 21st century,\u201d Assad\u2019s adviser said. \\nDamascus believes more countries will join in the counter-terrorism alliance of Russia, Iran and Syria, Shaaban said. \\n\u201cI\u2019m sure this nucleus of alliance is going to attract more countries. Now, if you think of India, or Brazil, or South Africa, or Algeria, or Tunisia, naturally you believe that there\u2019s no problem that these countries probably in the future joining\u2026 I\u2019m sure there are many countries who would like to be more active, China for example, who should be more active in fighting terrorism.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562482.1963923}
