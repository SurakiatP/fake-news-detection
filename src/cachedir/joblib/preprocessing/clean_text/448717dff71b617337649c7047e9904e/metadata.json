Which, in large part, it is. But to its director, Jodie Foster, it covers terrain more intimate than that, and more personal. It\u2019s a meditation on failure: how keenly people fear it, what they do when confronted with it. Its two main characters, captor and captive, inhabit the same purgatory. They\u2019re coming to terms with their own inadequacy. \u201cFailure is a big one for me  \u2014   people in spiritual crisis, in a moment in life of total \u201d Ms. Foster told me recently, explaining how the movie, to be released May 13, connects to her. Does she often think of herself as a failure? \u201cOh yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God, yeah. If Mother Teresa is propelled to do good works because she believes in God, I am propelled to do good works because of how bad I feel about myself. It\u2019s the first place I go. \u2018Oh, what did I do wrong? \u2019\u201d This is not the direction in which you expect a conversation with a   Oscar winner to turn. But as guarded as so many decades in the spotlight have made Ms. Foster, there\u2019s also something naked about her, a   too fervent to stay hidden. You see it in her best performances. You saw it at the Golden Globes in 2013, when she accepted an honorary award with a raw, rambling speech that set the Internet ablaze: Had she just come out of the closet? Had she even been in the closet? She was asking at once to be understood and to be left alone, still searching all these years later for a resolution to the contradiction of celebrity, and her remarks were so messy in their way that I was stunned when she told me that she\u2019d scripted them carefully in advance. \u201cEvery word,\u201d she said, adding that she even had them put on a teleprompter. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get it wrong. \u201d But what precisely was she trying to get right? The world was fixated on her allusions to her private life. She was focused on an announcement about her professional one: On the far side of 50, she was pivoting toward less glamorous work behind the scenes. She hasn\u2019t taken a new acting assignment since, instead concentrating on directing. \u201cMoney Monster\u201d is her fourth   effort along those lines, after \u201cLittle Man Tate\u201d (1991) \u201cHome for the Holidays\u201d (1995) and \u201cThe Beaver\u201d (2011) and it\u2019s by far the most ambitious, a New York City thriller with SWAT teams, explosives, George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Mr. Clooney is the financial guru, who loosely evokes Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC cable show \u201cMad Money. \u201d Ms. Roberts is his producer, who\u2019s in his ear throughout the hostage crisis, talking him through it, as steady as he is spastic. (The captor is played by Jack O\u2019Connell.) One striking aspect of the movie is how large Ms. Roberts\u2019s character looms, and I asked Ms. Foster if that would have been the case in a male director\u2019s hands. She said that she hadn\u2019t thought about that, but, in fact, many of the screenplay revisions that she requested involved fleshing out that role. Strong women are her trademark as a performer, the thread running through \u201cThe Accused\u201d (her first Oscar for best actress) \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d (her second) \u201cPanic Room,\u201d \u201cFlightplan,\u201d \u201cThe Brave One\u201d and more. But not just strong women: women who don\u2019t turn to a man in the clutch women whose strength is inseparable from the walls they\u2019ve built around themselves. They\u2019re \u201csolitary characters who don\u2019t have mothers and fathers and boyfriends,\u201d she told me, and they demonstrate her desire, when acting, \u201cto have an experience that\u2019s all mine, and I don\u2019t really want to share it. \u201d \u201cYet I\u2019m totally desperate to communicate it to you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really weird dichotomy. And I think that\u2019s me in life. \u201d She sat on a couch, legs curled under her and shoes kicked off, in an office here on the lot of Sony Pictures, which is distributing \u201cMoney Monster. \u201d I\u2019d last seen her in downtown Manhattan months earlier, when she was shooting a crucial scene and when she described, within minutes of our meeting, how powerfully the Clooney part spoke to her. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy on TV, but he\u2019s imbued with this sense of power,\u201d she said, adding that he\u2019s forced to ask questions that she has asked herself: \u201cAm I real? Am I a sellout? Is all of this real?\u201d She meant the adulation that comes with fame, which she achieved early. The year she turned 14, she had five movies released, including \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d \u201cBugsy Malone\u201d and \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d in which her precocious turn as an underage prostitute earned her an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. During her time at Yale University, she acted in another five movies, juggling them with her studies, including a thesis on   literature. Henry Louis Gates Jr. then teaching there, was one of her advisers. She babysat for his two young children, and he recalled arranging an interview for her with Toni Morrison and telling the novelist only that his student Alicia Foster  \u2014   that\u2019s Jodie\u2019s real name  \u2014   was en route. \u201cWhen she walked in, I think Toni almost had a heart attack,\u201d Professor Gates, now at Harvard, told me. He and Ms. Foster remain friends, and he said that he still marvels at the poise that \u201callowed her to get through a crisis that probably would have been crushing to most of us. \u201d He was referring to John Hinckley Jr. \u2019s shooting of President Reagan, which Mr. Hinckley, who had stalked Ms. Foster, said he did to impress her. She was in her freshman year at Yale. Not long after she graduated, she considered ditching movies altogether and doing graduate work with Professor Gates. \u201cThe Accused\u201d was about to be released, and she was convinced that the movie and her performance were no good. Her mother, Evelyn, worried that \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d would be a mistake and, as Ms. Foster remembers it, said to her: \u201cThe good part is Hannibal Lecter. Why are you taking the dull part?\u201d The two have always been extraordinarily close  \u2014   her mother was a single mom and carefully steered her career early on  \u2014   so it pained the actress when they had a much bigger tussle over \u201cNell,\u201d in which Ms. Foster played a wild woman (literally) who spoke a gibberish of her own invention. Evelyn Foster channeled her broader apprehensions about the movie into her daughter\u2019s specific decision to darken her hair for the role. \u201cShe was relentless, and she wouldn\u2019t get off it,\u201d Ms. Foster said. \u201cShe was yelling at me. Why did I have to dye my hair? She was just like, \u2018You\u2019re ruining your image,\u2019 or whatever it was. And I remember sending her this really long letter, and the letter was, \u2018I really love you, but I\u2019m not going to talk to you for four and a half months,\u2019\u201d until the movie wraps. \u201cShe totally got it  \u2014   she sent me flowers,\u201d Ms. Foster added. \u201cAnd then I talked to her four months later. That was one of the movies where if I thought for one minute that I was making a fool of myself, I would not be able to perform. \u201d She made clear to me that she was sharing that story only because it couldn\u2019t embarrass her mother, who has advanced dementia. Ms. Foster is mindful of the privacy of family members, including her two sons, the oldest of whom will leave for college in the fall, and her wife, the photographer Alexandra Hedison. The couple began their relationship soon after that Golden Globes speech and were wed in early 2014. Ms. Foster deflected questions about that. \u201cI never will talk about marriage and friends,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are only so many steps I can take to protect people I love. There\u2019s only so much I can do to keep them safe. It\u2019s kind of a horrible feeling to know that if somebody\u2019s close to you, you put them in danger of being hurt, of being sullied  \u2014   trivialized  \u2014   just by virtue of knowing you. \u201d In the Globes speech, she fleetingly acknowledged a previous relationship to Cydney Bernard, describing her as \u201cmy heroic   my   in love but righteous soul sister in life. \u201d Did she intend that as the kind of declaration about her sexual orientation that some   advocates had long pressed for? \u201cEverything I have to say on that subject, I said that night,\u201d she told me, acknowledging that some people remained puzzled. \u201cI can be vague. Vague is moving to me. \u201d In recent years, she has directed episodes of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d picking up Emmy and Directors Guild of America nominations. But her chance to helm movies came earlier, even though that opportunity still eludes many women. She was spared such resistance because so many male executives \u201cknew me as the    who showed up on time, and they didn\u2019t see it as a risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThey looked at me as if I was a daughter. They\u2019d seen me grow up. They knew my professionalism. \u201d So did the \u201cMoney Monster\u201d producers. \u201cTalk to anyone who has worked with her,\u201d said one of them, Lara Alameddine. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell you the same thing. She is the most prepared person. She\u2019s the first one there and the last one to leave. \u201d Mel Gibson, who starred in \u201cThe Beaver,\u201d said that \u201cthe way she directs films, the way she does anything  \u2014   it\u2019s just very smart. She attacks it and deals with it and delivers. \u201d The two formed a deep friendship after making \u201cMaverick\u201d more than two decades ago, though their bond baffles outsiders. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to adjudicate his behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly not sexist and certainly not racist. I know the guy I know, somebody who\u2019s really emotional, who I can have long, long conversations with, who\u2019s trustworthy, who shows up for me. \u201d Mr. Gibson said: \u201cI just love her, that\u2019s all. You meet people like that sometimes. You just instantly fall in love, and that\u2019s it, and it\u2019s the purest kind of thing. We call each other up all the time and just say, \u2018Hey, I love you. \u2019\u201d Ms. Foster\u2019s current emphasis on directing over acting partly recognizes that at 53, she won\u2019t find as many great roles as she once did. But it also reflects her ceaseless process of   and  . \u201cEverybody in my life said to me: When you stop acting, you\u2019re going to be lost,\u201d she said, meaning that directors don\u2019t quite have the visibility and currency of actual movie stars. \u201cWhat are you going to do when people don\u2019t take your phone call or when you can\u2019t get a reservation in a restaurant?\u201d I looked for some sign that she was being falsely modest or pulling my leg. Amazingly, she wasn\u2019t. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll lose my identity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I guess I need to find out, and I\u2019m willing to take that chance. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564430.8909156}
