The reason? The unsuspecting youngster was wearing one of the popular t-shirts that read \u201cMy dad is an ATM.\u201d (Image via redbubble.net) \\nA horrified Rakesh has vowed to never, ever don the t-shirt henceforth. \u201cThere I was, zooming around in my Merc as usual, with a few cops on the road saluting me. But as I was driving, I happened to notice large queues on the roads, outside ATMs. I thought of seeing what the problem was and stepped out of the car. The moment the crowd saw me, they looked intently at each other and before I knew it, they collectively sprinted towards me, gunning for my throat. I quickly hopped into my car and sped away, but they chased me unflinchingly. Thankfully, I saw my dad, surrounded by a few security guards, just returning from his morning walk. The guards were of no avail, as the mob overpowered them with ease and started frisking dad all over. Some of them even stuffed his mouth with their debit cards, hoping for some notes to come out. Thankfully, dad had only \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 rupee notes in his wallet, so the mobsters threw the wallet right back at his face, spat at us and went back. It was only after the melee subsided, did I realize the reason for it all happening \u2013 I was wearing one of my dozen of \u2018My dad is an ATM\u2019 t-shirts. Phew! Never putting these on again,\u201d the harrowed Rakesh narrated to The UnReal Times . \\nCompanies manufacturing the t-shirts have offered to insert a \u2018NOT\u2019 in the middle of the statement for free. \u201cWe\u2019re recalling all such t-shirts and without any payment, we\u2019re willing to stitch a ^ NOT after the \u2018is\u2019 and before the \u2018an.\u2019 The safety and security of our customers is our topmost concern,\u201d one such clothing manufacturer stated. \\nThe Bemaani family, however, received a flurry of support from the Bollywood fraternity. Tweeting to PM Narendra Modi was actor Arshad Warsi, who stated, \u201cMr. PM, your so-called masterstroke and surgical strike is paining not only the poor and common men, but also the billionaires. Of what good is all this, really? Can you please come back to India and repeal this goddamn rule? I don\u2019t mind sponsoring your return ticket, if you do this!\u201d Warsi was followed by director Anurag Kashyap, who tweeted angrily to the PM demanding an apology. \\nThe Bemaani family was also visited by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who sat in protest against the abrupt demonetization scheme. \u201cLike aloo ki factories, we also need paise ki factories instead of ATMs. If we empower the villagers, we can get this done soon,\u201d the Nehru-Gandhi scion stated. The Delhi CM was far more scathing in his diatribe. \u201cThe psychopath isn\u2019t happy with the already prevailing smog. He wants more people to come out to the streets, thereby increase the smog and punish Delhites fatally for not voting for him. Yehi to scam hai ji ,\u201d the AAP chief yelled. \\nA section of liberal democrats in the US, however, hailed the development as a sweet revenge against the presidential election of Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening! Billionaires all over the world will have to incur people\u2019s wrath like this, for having one of their own, and a racist, bigot, xenophobe at that, as the US president,\u201d said one such tolerant, intellectual democrat.
