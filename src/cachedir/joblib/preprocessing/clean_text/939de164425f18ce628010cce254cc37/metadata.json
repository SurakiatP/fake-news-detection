Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins 11/02/2016 \\nWhile speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported. \\nCharlie Spiering wrote: \\n\u201cHe has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,\u201d Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. \\nClinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. \\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges \u2013 the challenge posed by slavery \u2013 and we fought a civil war,\u201d she said. \\nShe warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. \\n\u201cBut we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,\u201d she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. \\nShe also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. \\n\u201cI know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. \\nA post at Barracuda Brigade observed: \\nLiberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of \u201chope and change\u201d when in fact it is just more of the same. \\nMoreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing. \\nStill, we have to ask \u2014 was Clinton\u2019s \u201chint\u201d a \u201cwarning\u201d or a \u201cthreat?\u201d \\nRelated:'"}, "time": 1742564130.213739}
