During a preview of an interview set to air on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cThe First 100 Days,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence pushed back against assertions that the   on the National Security Council constituted a demotion of homeland security adviser Tom Bossert and chief strategist and former Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon.  Pence said that neither Bannon and Bossert were demoted, and both are \u201chighly valued members of this administration. They\u2019re going to continue to play important policy roles. But I think with H. R. McMaster\u2019s addition as our National Security Adviser, a man of extraordinary background in the military, this is just a natural evolution, to ensure the National Security Council is organized in a way that best serves the president in resolving and making those difficult decisions. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett,  '"}, "time": 1742561717.9564316}
