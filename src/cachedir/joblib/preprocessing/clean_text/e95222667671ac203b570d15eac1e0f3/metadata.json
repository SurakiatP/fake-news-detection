minute joleah b lamb postdoctoral researcher cornell university lead author new study say hope would help draw attention plight call seagrass ugly stepchild marine organism say dr lamb not get lot

depth feet sediment grow load deadly hydrogen sulfide detoxify pump oxygen release photosynthesis root adaptation seagrass meadow become productive today fertilize cornfield spread across planet meadow alter sea floor build soil support entirely new ecosystem animal like manatee juvenile fish take residence killer whale big tourist attraction people probably not realize seagrass bed really

seagrass get little sunlight result dim deadly seagrass also pummel climate change warm summer temperature chesapeake bay cause plant lose much oxygen leave less oxygen pump root poison toxic sediment cloudiness water make heat even bad less sunlight plant produce even less protective oxygen begin double whammy say dr orth underwater meadow disappear economic value disappear chesapeake bay meadow
