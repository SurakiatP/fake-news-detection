Many things, really: a rebel commander a witty internal critic of the celebrity machine a teller of comic tales, true and embellished an inspiring and cautionary avatar of excess and resilience an emblem of the honesty we crave (and so rarely receive) from beloved purveyors of  . When I heard the news of Ms. Fisher\u2019s death on Tuesday, what immediately popped into my mind was not \u201cStar Wars\u201d but \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d  \u2014   that unforgettable episode from Season 2 of \u201c30 Rock,\u201d in which she turns up as a legendary and colossally difficult television writer, Rosemary Howard. [ Read Carrie Fisher\u2019\u2019s obituary ] Liz Lemon, the   television writer played (and created) by Tina Fey, idolizes Rosemary, seeing her as a pioneer and a spiritual mother. But even symbolic   relationships have a way of turning dysfunctional, and Liz comes to see Rosemary less as a beacon than a warning  \u2014   an image of the cynical, resentful,   dingbat Liz herself might well become. Emily Nussbaum, the New Yorker\u2019s television critic, remarked on Twitter that the episode was \u201cthe     of female comedy,\u201d which may actually be an understatement. The character of Rosemary Howard certainly embodies the glories and contradictions of   feminism, and Liz\u2019s ambivalence about her is a barbed and brilliant illustration of the anxieties of female comic influence. But the casting of Ms. Fisher  \u2014   whose performance on the show is somehow at once wildly winking and completely    \u2014   adds about 12 dimensions of meta. Anyone watching that episode will already know that Liz Lemon is a rabid \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan. Her default Halloween costume is Princess Leia Organa. Later, when she wants to get out of jury duty, Liz will coil her hair over her ears and dress in a belted linen djellaba, confident that no judge would ever impanel such a cosplaying nerd. She\u2019s wrong about that, and also wrong to sell out her Leia devotion, treating it as a source of embarrassment rather than power and pride. The princess allows Liz  \u2014   and not only Liz  \u2014   to be both geek and warrior, sex symbol and samurai, free spirit and prisoner of the corporate Death Star. Liz Lemon has two mothers, both played by Carrie Fisher. That statement can stand as a fictional index of Ms. Fisher\u2019s extensive   influence. Princess Leia  \u2014   now General Organa of the Rebel Alliance  \u2014   will always define her as an actress, something she claimed, in a recent Rolling Stone interview, not to mind. \u201cI like Princess Leia,\u201d she said. \u201cI like how she was feisty. I like how she killed Jabba the Hutt. \u201d That feistiness has been Leia\u2019s principal legacy, the early sign of a shift in the understanding of female heroism  \u2014   and the meanings of the word princess  \u2014   that has rippled through popular culture in the past 40 years. Leia is a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless   Disney princesses. She also foretold the recent, somewhat belated feminist turn in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d cycle itself. All of a sudden, and at long last, Leia is not the only   heroine in the galaxy, having been joined by Rey in \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d and Jyn in \u201cRogue One. \u201d Ms. Fisher\u2019s legacy may rest at least as much on her literary voice, on the alter egos she created on the page, as on any character she played onscreen. She was hardly the first or the only Hollywood figure to spill the beans about sex, drugs and other   shenanigans. Nor was she unique among writers in the way she mined her own painful history of addiction and mental illness for harrowing and humorous copy. But \u201cPostcards From the Edge,\u201d her 1987 roman \u00e0 clef about a movie star named Suzanne Vale with a cocaine problem and a difficult   mom, bristles with a bravery and candor that still feels groundbreaking. She went there, long before that was a catchphrase, and before that particular there was such a crowded piece of real estate. In her Rolling Stone interview and elsewhere, Ms. Fisher liked to cite Dorothy Parker as an inspiration. She carried that tradition forward, and the frank, funny, confessionally inclined and   women who now flourish on television and in print  \u2014   the list is too long they know who they are  \u2014   are in her debt. \u201cYou\u2019re my kid!\u201d Rosemary Howard cries out to Liz Lemon. An echo of the famous assertion of paternity in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d saga. And also an acknowledgment of Carrie Fisher\u2019s own undeniable status as a matriarch.'"}, "time": 1742628293.841309}
