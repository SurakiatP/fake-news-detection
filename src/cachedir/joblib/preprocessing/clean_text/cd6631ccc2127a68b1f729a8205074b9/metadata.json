The speeches feature Ali calling whites \u201ccrackers\u201d and \u201cwhite devils,\u201d and telling black congregants that blacks want to be segregated from whites. [The speeches, which were released after a Freedom of Information Act request by Washington watchdog group Judicial Watch, revealed that Ali had far more radical views about race than his more benign public persona might have led people to believe.  Not only did Ali thunder that the 1964 civil rights act was a \u201cswindle\u201d on blacks, he also went on to excoriate whites, calling them \u201c  devil white people,\u201d and insisting that \u201cthe   Negro is the original man and is superior to the white devil. \u201d The FBI files show that Ali told a crowd at a Washington D. C. mosque that he preferred \u201cdying outright\u201d or going to jail than going into the U. S. Army. In another speech delivered at a Cleveland mosque, Ali said the American flag \u201crepresented death and destruction,\u201d but the   \u201cMuslim flag\u201d represents \u201clife and prosperity, justice for all black men. \u201d According to the FBI reports, the groups Ali spoke to were congregations of the Nation of Islam, an extremist hate group the FBI defined as an \u201c    organization which espouses a line of violent hatred of the white race, Government, law and law enforcement. \u201d The Nation of Islam is highly   and teaches its followers that whites will all be killed in a coming \u201cWar of Armageddon. \u201d The   heavyweight champion, who passed away in June of 2016 after a lengthy battle with Parkinson\u2019s syndrome, is today portrayed as a courageous crusader for equal rights as well as one of America\u2019s most celebrated sportsmen. But, his   speeches reveal a figure steeped in hate and racist proclamations. Ali\u2019s family recently started a new civil rights campaign to fight   sentiment and have used their famed father\u2019s legacy as a basis to push their effort. Their \u201cStep into the Ring\u201d campaign began after Ali\u2019s son, Muhammad Ali, Jr. was briefly detained at a Florida airport. The boxer\u2019s namesake son said he was racially and religiously profiled by airport authorities. But, the files now reluctantly released by the FBI paint a far more radical Muhammad Ali than his publicly accepted reputation.
