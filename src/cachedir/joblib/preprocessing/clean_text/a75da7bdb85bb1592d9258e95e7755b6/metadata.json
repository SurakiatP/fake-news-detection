Can we find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other?\u201d For the 11th time in his tenure, President Obama sought to offer comfort and a way forward after a mass killing. At a memorial for five Dallas officers targeted by a black Army veteran, he praised the city as a model for progressive policing and said the country\u2019s racial tensions could be overcome. \u201cI\u2019m here to insist that we are not so divided as we seem,\u201d he said. Former President George W. Bush also spoke of healing. \u201cTo renew our unity we only have to remember our values,\u201d he said. _____ 2. The memorial paused for a long ovation for the Dallas police chief, David Brown, who has become the face not only of the city\u2019s grief but the voice of national police frustration. He expressed his feelings for his force and their sacrifice with the lyrics to the Stevie Wonder song \u201cAs. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be loving   the rainbow burns the stars out in the   the ocean covers every mountain high,\u201d he read. _____ 3. The family of Philando Castile, who was killed by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop, called for a special prosecutor to take over the case. He was one of two black men shot by police officers last week in killings that drew widespread attention. _____ 4. \u201cSecretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process,\u201d Bernie Sanders told a cheering crowd in New Hampshire. In his endorsement, intended in part to coax his 13 million voting supporters into Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp, he denounced Donald Trump as much as he praised her. \u201cYou were great, so great,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Sanders after they shared a hug. Her campaign is looking at a retired admiral and former top NATO commander, James Stavridis, as a possible vice president. _____ 5. Mr. Trump said he would announce his choice of a running mate by Friday. He\u2019s been considering Gov. Chris Christie retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn Senator Joni Ernst Gov. Mike Pence the former Speaker Newt Gingrich and two unknowns  \u2014   none of them seen as the party\u2019s top stars. He also criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her recent harsh criticism of his candidacy, calling her engagement in politics \u201ca disgrace\u201d to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable   Republican candidates are trying to escape Mr. Trump\u2019s shadow. _____ 6. U. S. stocks had a particularly good day. The Dow closed at a record high, and the S. P. 500 logged a second strong day. The Nasdaq, heavily weighted with technology and biotech stocks, erased its losses for the year. But the embrace of risk did nothing to raise historically low bond yields. _____ 7. Major League Baseball\u2019s   game is tonight in San Diego. The National League\u2019s team is rich with Chicago Cubs, including the full starting infield. Johnny Cueto of the San Francisco Giants pitches. Pitching for the American League team: Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox. (8 p. m. Eastern, Fox). _____ 8. \u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming victory. \u201d That\u2019s a lawyer for the Philippines, saluting an international tribunal\u2019s sweeping ruling against China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea. But tensions are hardly over. There is no mechanism to enforce the decision, and China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said, \u201cChina does not accept or recognize\u201d it. _____ 9. The House may vote this week on a bill requiring that most foods containing genetically engineered ingredients be identified. One of our   articles today looks at the myths and mysteries of G. M. O. s. For instance, mushrooms genetically modified not to easily bruise don\u2019t have to be labeled, because no DNA from another organism was added. And Japan\u2019s square watermelons have nothing to do with genetic manipulation  \u2014   they\u2019re just grown in boxes. _____ 10. Finally, it\u2019s moving day for David Cameron. The British prime minister is vacating 10 Downing St. in a hurry. The home secretary Theresa May, is to succeed him on Wednesday, just two days after she won the Conservative Party\u2019s leadership contest. Above, she walked past the only member of the household remaining behind: Larry the Cat, also known as chief mouser to the cabinet office. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
