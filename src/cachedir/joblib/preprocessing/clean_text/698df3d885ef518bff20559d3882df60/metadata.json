Today\u2019s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles, and the photographer Melissa Lyttle. When \u201cZoot Suit\u201d made its debut in New York in 1979, it was the first time a Chicano show had made it to Broadway. But the musical by Luis Valdez was a distinctly Los Angeles production: it was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving      youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against   in the summer of 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group\u2019s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the downtown stage for the first time since 1978. When tickets went on sale late last year, the production sold out quickly and has since been extended three separate times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and enthusiasm demonstrates how the play touches a deep nerve in Los Angeles, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to hear what the play means to them.

[The New York Times] Imagine you\u2019re a newly born elephant seal, like the one above. You\u2019re lying on the beach trying to get some   rest. And then all of a sudden, a loud, buzzing drone comes out of nowhere, totally interrupting your nap. These kinds of incidents are becoming more common on beaches up and down the California coast, according to workers at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito. Laura Chapman, 26, a rescue coordinator at the center, said in an interview Wednesday that the drones were likely being used for sightseeing or taking pictures, and that their pilots might be unaware of the harbor and elephant seals they are disturbing. \u201cWith new technology comes new responsibility,\u201d she said. Ms. Chapman said that the noise was interrupting a very sensitive period in the lives of the young seals, and that the disruption could have implications for the pups\u2019 nutrition. \u201cIf the animal\u2019s looking at the drone, if they\u2019re looking at you, they\u2019re being harassed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want people to know how big an impact they can have. \u201d Want to submit a photo for possible publication?
