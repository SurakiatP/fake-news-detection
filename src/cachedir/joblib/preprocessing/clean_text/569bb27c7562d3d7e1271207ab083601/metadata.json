Trump, his voice rising as Jim Acosta of CNN tried to interject. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to give you a question. I\u2019m not going to give you a question. \u201d \u201cYou,\u201d the   said, as Mr. Acosta and other stunned journalists looked on, \u201care fake news. \u201d Any hope that Mr. Trump would temper his attacks on the news media after the campaign seemed to dissipate in the marble atrium of Trump Tower on Wednesday, as the   holding his first news conference since July, turned a controversy over his ties to Russia into a deft and unrelenting attack on the journalists who reported it. It was a spectacle that attracted nearly 300 reporters to Midtown Manhattan  \u2014   the news conference was carried live in Australia, England and Germany  \u2014   and it came against an extraordinary backdrop: reports that intelligence officials had briefed Mr. Trump on a document alleging collusion between the Russian government and his campaign. CNN broke the news on Tuesday but declined to publish specific allegations, saying its reporters could not verify them. BuzzFeed News published the unverified claims in full, a move that prompted an ethical debate in journalistic circles  \u2014   and offered Mr. Trump an opening. \u201cThe fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks,\u201d the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said, inaccurately lumping the two news organizations together. But the result was classic Trump: Not only did he break the norms of presidential engagement with the news media, snubbing organizations because of an unflattering story, but he also had elements of a frustrated political press corps warring with one another. Immediately after the news conference, CNN defended its reporting and drew a sharp distinction between its news story and \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos. \u201d On a broadcast, the CNN anchor Jake Tapper said that BuzzFeed\u2019s move \u201churts us all. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible to put uncorroborated information on the internet,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Tapper said. \u201cI can understand why   Trump would be upset about that I would be upset about it. too. \u2019\u2019 Later, Chuck Todd, the NBC News moderator, repeatedly pressed BuzzFeed\u2019s editor in chief, Ben Smith, on why unverified claims did not amount to \u201cfake news. \u201d Mr. Smith, for his part, said he was \u201cnot going to participate in an attempt to divide the media against each other. \u201d (In a memo on Wednesday, BuzzFeed\u2019s chief executive, Jonah H. Peretti, defended the move. \u201cWe are going to keep doing what we do best, which is deliver impactful journalism,\u201d he wrote.) Still, by the time the news conference finished  \u2014   with Omarosa Manigault, the \u201cApprentice\u201d star and future member of the White House staff, heckling Mr. Acosta, shouting, \u201cCut it out!\u201d  \u2014   Mr. Trump had bobbed and weaved his way through nearly an hour of interrogation, offering vague answers to critical questions about his administration. Yet the conduct of the news media, a familiar foil from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign days, remained at the center of the day\u2019s story. The treatment of Mr. Acosta raised alarms among news media advocates and his fellow journalists, particularly after Mr. Acosta described a threat by Mr. Spicer to eject him from the news conference when he persisted in trying to ask the   a question. Harsh words between reporters and press secretaries happen. But an anchor for a rival network, Shepard Smith of Fox News, later came to Mr. Acosta\u2019s defense, saying that no \u201cjournalists should be subjected to belittling and delegitimizing by the   of the United States. \u201d The National Press Club also lamented Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior, saying in a statement: \u201cPresidents shouldn\u2019t get to pick and choose which reporters\u2019 questions they will answer based on what news outlet for which they work. \u201d Mr. Trump, who ultimately took one question from a CNN reporter, also called on journalists from two   organizations: BreitbartNews and One America News. Matthew Boyle, the Breitbart reporter, asked the   for his ideas on how to reform the news media. Mostly, however, Mr. Trump took questions from journalists at the major television networks, with John Roberts of Fox News going first. A Greek chorus of sorts  \u2014   mostly Trump supporters and aides, including Ms. Manigault  \u2014   watched from the side, applauding Mr. Trump and jeering questions from reporters they deemed unpleasant. A man who prides himself on finding an opponent\u2019s weakness, Mr. Trump at one point zeroed in on an existential question that has lingered in many newsrooms since his surprise victory: How much does the traditional news media still matter in a polarized age? When Hallie Jackson, an NBC News correspondent, asked the   if he would finally release his tax returns, to verify his claim that he has no financial dealings in Russia, Mr. Trump scoffed. \u201cYou know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, O. K.?\u201d the   said. \u201cThey\u2019re the only ones who ask. \u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think the American public is concerned about it?\u201d Ms. Jackson asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, before laying down the political equivalent of a  : \u201dI won. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562019.439805}
