David Perdue (R. .) cheered President Donald Trump\u2019s new executive order on immigration Monday shortly after the president signed it at the White House. [\u201cSince Day One, President Trump has kept his promise to protect our country and keep all Americans safe,\u201d said Perdue, the only Fortune 500 CEO serving in Congress. He went on:  Trump and his National Security Team have closely examined our vetting procedures for countries with ISIS strongholds and continue to take action to stop ISIS from exploiting our country\u2019s immigration system and refugee programs. They have made several updates to these efforts, including, allowing citizens from adequately vetted countries like Iraq to travel to the United States, and ensuring that people who have been granted green cards can travel to and from our country. . @POTUS\u2019 new Executive Order is meant to secure our country  protect all Americans and refugees from our shared enemy. pic. twitter.   \u2014   David Perdue (@sendavidperdue) March 6, 2017,  Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the executive order reflects the president\u2019s concern for the safety of the American people. \u201cWe must undertake a rigorous review of our visa and refugee vetting programs to increase our confidence in the entry decisions we make for visitors and immigrants to the United States. We cannot risk the prospect of malevolent actors using our immigration system to take American lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe executive order signed today is prospective in nature \u2014  applying only to foreign nationals outside of the United States who do not have a valid visa,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt is important to note that nothing in this executive order affects current lawful permanent residents or persons with current authorization to enter our country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a current valid visa to travel, we welcome you. But unregulated, unvetted travel is not a universal privilege, especially when national security is at stake,\u201d he said. #SecretaryKelly: We cannot risk prospect of malevolent actors using our immigration system to take American lives \u2192 https:  .   \u2014   Homeland Security (@DHSgov) March 6, 2017,  Monday\u2019s executive order comes after the rough rollout of the Jan. 27 executive order that suspended travelers from seven countries with a limited ability to vet immigrants and refugees: Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, and Sudan. That original executive order was challenged in the courts, and a federal judge blocked the administration from enforcing it. The new executive order tightens up the loose ends from the Jan. 27 order and reflects a more robust staff process now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is confirmed and in place along with other key staffers. Trump also dropped Iraq from the order after its government pledged to partner with the American government vetting immigrants and refugees from there. Perdue said the changes from the withdrawn executive order are focused on the real job of the president. \u201cThese updates underscore President Trump\u2019s intent to responsibly secure our country and protect all Americans and refugees from our shared enemy, ISIS. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561936.867755}
