Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces \u2014 leading Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels \u2014 took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. \\nThe issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.-supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains : \\n\u201cKurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. \\n\u201cHowever, Turkey\u2019s intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF.\u201d \\nThe problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey who\u2019ve been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. \\nSo regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, it\u2019s taking a much more proactive stance than that. \\nLast Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were \u201cthe heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria,\u201d Turkey targeted three Kurdish-controlled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out \u201c26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia\u201d and \u201chad killed between 160 and 200 combatants.\u201d \\nTurkey\u2019s major concern is that Kurdish-controlled enclaves will physically unite, \u201cthereby creating a de facto Kurdish mini-state along the Turkish border.\u201d As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. \\nThis tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.-led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently \u2014 even if somewhat grudgingly \u2014 bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. \\n\u201cFrom now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us,\u201d Erdogan said from his palace last week. \u201cLet them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly: they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.\u201d NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
