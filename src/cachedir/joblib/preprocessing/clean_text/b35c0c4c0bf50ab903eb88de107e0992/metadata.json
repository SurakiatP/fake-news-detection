Does Senator Boxer\u2019s support for Israel and for the domestic Jewish Agenda. \\n\\nPresident Obama signs the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act in the Oval Office, July 27, 2012. With him from left are Richard Stone, chairman, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA); Howard Friedman, past chair of AIPAC;, Rep. Howard Berman (D-CA); and Lee Rosenberg, AIPAC chair. It\u2019s just a (((coincidence))) that all five people standing behind Obama (((just happen))) to be Jewish. \\nDr. Slattery joined the show and pointed out hypocrisy of people like Jonathan Greenblat calling for Donald Trump not to appoint Steve Bannon to his administration over allegations that he did not want to his kids to go to school with Jews when so many of Greenblat\u2019s own staff at the ADL send their kids to Jewish-only day schools. \\nThis is a great show. Please share it widely. \\nOur show is aired live at 11 am replayed at ET 4pm Eastern and 4am Eastern.'"}, "time": 1742628451.1227207}
