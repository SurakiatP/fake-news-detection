Persistent Surveillance Systems\u2019 technology automatically stores all the footage on massive hard drives, making it available to law enforcement long afterward \u2014 but the idea police could access this information to solve a simple property crime is no less than alarming. \\nParticularly considering the company\u2019s founder has an intense military background. \\nRoss McNutt, Bloomberg reports, \u201cis an Air Force Academy graduate, physicist, and MIT-trained astronautical engineer who in 2004 founded the Air Force\u2019s Center for Rapid Product Development. The Pentagon asked him if he could develop something to figure out who was planting the roadside bombs that were killing and maiming American soldiers in Iraq. In 2006 he gave the military Angel Fire, a wide-area, live-feed surveillance system that could cast an unblinking eye on an entire city.\u201d \\nThough the technology had imperfections \u2014 even determining the gender of a person on the ground was impossible \u2014 its TiVo-like capabilities more than made up for any shortcomings. A person of interest could be followed by rewinding footage after, say, an IED exploded roadside, to track their movements \u2014 even if the cameras weren\u2019t focused directly on the explosion at the moment it occurred. If the cameras were in the air at the time, anything that happened was fully trackable both back and forward in time. McNutt\u2019s pitch for his technology concisely summarized, \u201cImagine Google Earth with TiVo capability.\u201d \\nAngel Fire truly evolved at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico after 2007, when upgrades allowed for \u201call-weather and nighttime capabilities and then was used as the basis for another system, called Blue Devil, which coupled wide-area cameras with narrow-focus zoom lenses in the same package.\u201d \\nOver time, after McNutt retired from the military, he worked to further improve the camera array and attended security conferences in hopes of garnering clients. After a brief but effective test run over the skies of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Los Angeles became the first U.S. city to employ Persistent Surveillance\u2019 system \u2014 and just as covertly as what has been taking place in Baltimore for the last eight months. \\nIn 2012, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department decided to conduct a trial of the system, launching surveillance over the Compton neighborhood for a total of nine days to determine if a contract would be desirable. Although the department ultimately decided against a long-term contract \u2014 citing quality in recorded footage as a detractor \u2014 the brief experiment had sharp repercussions when citizens learned about the covert project a full year afterward. \\nProtesters demanded a \u201ccitizen privacy protection policy\u201d from community leaders against such overarching intrusions by police, but as Bloomberg notes, none of those leaders \u2014 including the mayor \u2014 had been informed the about surveillance system flying overhead. \\n\u201cThere is nothing worse than believing you are being observed by a third party unnecessarily,\u201d Compton Mayor Aja Brown told the Los Angeles Times . \\nMcNutt next attempted to a contract with his own city, Dayton, after vastly improving both the cameras\u2019 resolutions, as well as the archive storage capacity and image processing capabilities. While Dayton police and city council jumped at the opportunity, controversy exploded during public hearings. \\n\u201cAt the hearings,\u201d recalled Joel Pruce, who teaches human rights studies at the University of Dayton, \u201cnobody spoke in favor of it except for the people working for the city. \\n\u201cThe black community, in particular, said, \u2018We\u2019ve seen this type of thing before. This will target us and you didn\u2019t even come to us beforehand to see how we\u2019d feel about it.\u2019\u201d \\nDayton promptly scrapped their plans for Persistent Surveillance\u2019 system after those hearings. \\nAfter the public radio show, Radiolab, aired a segment discussing Persistent Surveillance, Texas philanthropists Laura and John Arnold \u2014 John is a former Enron trader \u2014 contacted McNutt with the proposition to fund several months of his service if he could locate a willing city. \\nSince McNutt had met the Baltimore police lieutenant in charge of the city\u2019s ground-based surveillance camera system at security trade shows \u2014 and because the atmosphere in the city had just exploded following the death of Freddie Gray in police custody \u2014 the decision was easy. \\nIn January, McNutt began operating in a spare office above a parking garage, with the only identifying sign of Persistent Surveillance presence a piece of paper taped to the door, reading, \u201cCommunity Support Program.\u201d \\nBaltimore has already dealt with an excoriating report from the Justice Department on the city\u2019s policing practices and a recently-filed lawsuit with the FCC over law enforcement use of another invasive technology, Stingray, which mimics cell towers for tracking purposes. \\nMcNutt believes in the legitimacy of the services Persistent Surveillance can provide, and insists the technology isn\u2019t as invasive as it might sound since individual identifying details, among other aspects, aren\u2019t discernible, and because the every keystroke and action taken by analysts \u2014 like video footage \u2014 are logged and archived. \\nStill, this sort of surveillance \u2014 vague though it may be \u2014 undoubtedly represents yet another incremental incursion into people\u2019s private lives. And we all know where that slippery slope leads.'"}, "time": 1742561952.0752263}
