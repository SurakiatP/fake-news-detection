[The San Diego   reports, \u201c  vehicles poised to take taxi, train and truck driver jobs in the civilian sector also could nab many   slots in the Army. \u201d Additionally, \u201cWarehouse robots that scoot goods to delivery vans could run the same chores inside Air Force ordnance and supply units. \u201d  \u201cNew machines that can scan, collate and analyze hundreds of thousands of pages of legal documents in a day might outperform Navy legal researchers,\u201d they continued. \u201cNurses, physicians and corpsmen could face competition from computers designed to diagnose diseases and assist in the operating room  \u2026     Frogmen might no longer need to rip out sea mines by hand  \u2014   robots could do that for them. \u201d \u201cJust as in the civilian economy, automation will likely have a big impact on military organizations in logistics and manufacturing,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania professor Michael Horowitz. \u201cThe U. S. military is very likely to pursue forms of automation that reduce \u2018 \u2019 costs over time, as well as remove soldiers from   deployments where they might face risk from adversaries on fluid battlefields, such as in transportation. \u201d Henrik Christensen, the director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics at UC San Diego, added that \u201cthe jobs that are most boring will be the ones that get replaced. \u201d \u201cRobots will continue to replace the dirty, dull and dangerous jobs, and this will affect typically more uneducated and unskilled workers,\u201d said Christensen. \u201cYou need to look at the mundane things. Logistics tasks will not be solved by people driving around in trucks. Instead, you will have fewer drivers. The lead driver in a convoy might be human, but every truck following behind will not be. The jobs that are the most boring will be the ones that get replaced because they\u2019re the easiest to automate. \u201d During an interview with Quartz last week, Microsoft founder Bill Gates called for a robot tax to offset the jobs lost from automation. \u201cCertainly there will be taxes that relate to automation. Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50, 000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things,\u201d declared Gates. \u201cIf a robot comes in to do the same thing, you\u2019d think that we\u2019d tax the robot at a similar level. \u201d \u201cThere are many ways to take that extra productivity and generate more taxes. Exactly how you\u2019d do it, measure it, you know, it\u2019s interesting for people to start talking about now,\u201d he continued. \u201cSome of it can come on the profits that are generated by the   efficiency there. Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax. I don\u2019t think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax. It\u2019s OK. \u201d Gates also added that \u201cyou ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed of that adoption somewhat to figure out, \u2018OK, what about the communities where this has a particularly big impact? Which transition programs have worked and what type of funding do those require? \u2019\u201d Billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban also claimed on Sunday that robots are going to \u201ccause unemployment,\u201d posting, \u201cAutomation is going to cause unemployment and we need to prepare for it,\u201d to Twitter on Sunday, while in November, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk also predicted that automated robots would lead to mass unemployment, which he claimed could eventually create a universal wage from the government.
