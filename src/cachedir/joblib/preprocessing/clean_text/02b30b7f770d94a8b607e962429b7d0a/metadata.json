Although most the names on his list are fairly horrifying, none more so than who he is considering for White House Chief of Staff. Trump\u2019s top pick is reportedly former Breitbart bigwig, Steve Bannon. \\nSo what does a chief of staff do ? Well, the person holding this position is often called \u201cthe most powerful man in Washington.\u201d \\n\u201cThe duties of the White House chief of staff vary, yet traditionally encompass the following, such as: select and supervise key White House staff, control access to the Oval Office and the president, manage communications and information flow, and negotiate with Congress, executive branch agencies, and external political groups to implement the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d \\n\u201cIn fulfilling these duties, the chief of Staff oversees and coordinates the efforts of the following offices within the EOP and White House Office: the Council of Economic Advisers, National Security staff, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Legislative Affairs, and Office of Management and Administration, to name a few.\u201d \\nOkay, so that\u2019s an important job. So who the hell is Steve Bannon? Not surprisingly, he is the worst of the worst. \\nDavid Badash over at The New Civil Rights Movement summed it up quite nicely: Bannon \u201cstepped down at Breitbart to run the final few months of Trump\u2019s campaign, but for years he has run one of the most popular far, far right wing websites, Breitbart. It masquerades as a news site but it\u2019s home to the alt-right, as Bannon has bragged. In other words, the white supremacists and white nationalists, the anti-Semites, the anti-LGBT crowd, the anti-Black crowd, the anti-diversity, anti-feminism, anti-Obama movement. Racists, homophobes, bigots of every stripe get their \u2018news\u2019 at Breitbart. And it got Trump elected.\u201d \\nAccording to court filings from his divorce proceedings, Bannon is not only a sadistic wife beater , but he is also every bit as anti-Semitic as Breitbart itself. His wife testified that he fought against allowing his daughters to attend an upscale school because of the number of Jewish children that attended. \\n\u201cHe said that he doesn\u2019t like the way they raise their kids to be \u2018whiny brats\u2019 and that he didn\u2019t want the girls going to school with Jews.\u201d \\nThis man , this is who Trump wants to have serving as the White House Chief of Staff. His advisors are encouraging him to choose RNC Chair Reince Priebus, but we all know how Trump is with taking advice from people who might actually know what they\u2019re talking about. Who cares if Bannon actually knows anything about how to run the damn country, Trump just wants the biggest bigot he can find. \\nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742564378.0571642}
