Dave Brat told reporters in a hallway just off the House floor that he is confused by President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets attacking the House Freedom Caucus for hindering the president\u2019s agenda \u2014  specifically the American Health Care Act, or Ryancare. [\u201cI don\u2019t know who has his ear,\u201d said Brat, who is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and was part of the HFC team negotiating with the White House and the House Republican leadership to amend the Ryancare bill.  \u201cI don\u2019t think he is hearing that we are trying to serve him a victory \u2014  right? \u2014  Right now, this bill is at 17 percent in the polls, and that\u2019s not a winner. \u201d The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don\u2019t get on the team,  fast. We must fight them,  Dems, in 2018!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017,  Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) pulled the bill from the House floor Friday minutes before it was sure to be defeated. The Ryancare bill is a modification of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that created Obamacare. Although it was pulled from the floor, it is still active legislation and subject to manager\u2019s amendments from the chairmen of the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees, as well as changes made by the House Rules Committee, which reports the bill to the House floor with its final language. Brat said the key to fixing the American Health Care Act is to correct Obamacare provisions that drove up premiums, but in the current language in the Ryancare bill, premiums would still go up 10 percent or 15 percent. \u201cRight now, no young person can go out and buy a cheap insurance policy \u2014  by law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal regulations and mandates prevent you from shopping across state lines, which President Trump campaigned on. \u201d The president campaigned all over the country and told every arena audience that he would repeal Obamacare. Brat said the House Freedom Caucus is staying true to the president\u2019s campaign promises, which were not reflected in the Ryancare bill.

Dave Brat (@RepDaveBrat) March 25, 2017,  Another problem with the speaker\u2019s bill was that it was rushed through in a process that took only three weeks from Ryan releasing the text of the bill to what would have been a vote on the House floor. \u201cIf you have a good process, it will result in a good policy and then, that\u2019s good politics,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562650.864181}
