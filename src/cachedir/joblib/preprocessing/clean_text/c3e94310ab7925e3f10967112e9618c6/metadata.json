Wait, I changed my mind. They were big. \\nYou begin describing the big aliens\u2026 \\n\u201cThey were big.\u201d \\n\u201cWow! Big aliens,\u201d says the cabbie. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking. I never heard of anything like that. What were the big aliens like? Did they have legs?\u201d They had skin like leather. \\nYou don\u2019t tell the cabbie about aliens. \\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he says as he drives on. \u201cAliens! Gee. Makes sense, I guess. I never heard of nothing like aliens.\u201d Pass the rest of the ride in silence. Come to think of it, I did see some aliens tonight. And they were big. \\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d says the cabbie. \u201cLike I said, I never heard of anything like aliens before, but I was getting ready to believe you, especially if they had big, nice legs. Ones like you just described, though? Thanks but no thanks.\u201d Pass the rest of the ride in silence. Come to think of it, the aliens I saw did have big, nice legs. Five of them! \\nThe cabbie nods excitedly. \u2026and these hollow black eyes. \u2026and that\\'s it. \\nThe cabbie is rapt with awe. \u2026with fearsome ivory fangs. \\nThe cabbie signals you to keep going. \u2026and five big, nice legs. \u2026and that\\'s it. \\n\u201cAh, the legs! I can picture it perfectly,\u201d says the cabbie. \u201cAliens! I never heard of nothing like that before, but I can practically see those legs kicking, so nice and so big!\u201d \\nThe cab begins to swerve as the cabbie becomes more excited about how big the aliens\u2019 legs were and is no longer paying any attention to the road. I\\'m telling the truth! The legs were big! Wait, I just remembered! The legs were small! \\n\u201cYes, those big alien legs!\u201d the cabbie shrieks as he completely loses control of the vehicle, which goes careering up a nearby volcano. His last words as the taxi plummets over the verge and into molten lava are, \u201cI believe you!\u201d \\nSomeone believed that you were abducted by aliens, but at what cost? At the cost of dying in a volcano. Start Over \\n\u201cHere we are! Sister\u2019s apartment!\u201d says the cabbie. Great. How much do I owe you? Leave without paying. \\n\u201cThis one\u2019s on the house!\u201d says the cabbie. Thanks! \\nYou\u2019re outside your sister\u2019s apartment complex, which is where your sister makes $1,111 per day working from home. \\nYou super trust and super admire your sister. She is a master of logic and facts, and you know she\u2019ll have a high bar for believing your story. You\u2019ll need to remember a lot of good detail if you hope to convince her, and you\u2019ll need to hurry, since your memory is already feeling a little fuzzy\u2026 Text your sister about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens. Send your sister nine emails about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens. Text your sister the \"alien\" emoji, the \"abduction\" emoji, and the \"outside apartment\" emoji. \\nYour sister answers the door immediately. She invites you to sit down on the couch and hands you a microphone with the local news channel\u2019s logo cube on it and asks you to tell her what happened. I was abducted by aliens, and I am going to tell you all about it. Stand back, my sibling. I am going to convince you that I was abducted by aliens. \\n\u201cAliens, eh?\u201d your sister asks. \u201cAbducted by?\u201d Yes, my sister, they stole me from the atmosphere, and now I\\'m back. Precisely. Now listen up, my sibling. Here comes the tale. \\n\u201cGo ahead then,\u201d says your sister. \u201cTell me a story about how aliens stole you from the atmosphere.\u201d It began like any other night\u2026 It began right away with aliens\u2026 It began right after the aliens had left me in the forest and disappeared\u2026 \\nYou begin your story\u2026 \\n\u201cThe alien light dissipated. I was alone in the forest at night. \\nI decided to hail a cab, so I stuck out my arm in the universal sign for \u2018taxi.\u2019 Immediately, a cab burst from the forest. \\n\u2018Where you headed?\u2019 the cab driver asked.\u201d I got in and told him to go to my sister\\'s house. The cabbie got out of the cab. \\n\u201cIt was then I remember the cabbie got out of his cab.\u201d Then he got back in the cab. And that\\'s all I remember. \\n\u201cSo,\u201d says your sister. \u201cIf I have your story right, you hailed a cab in the forest, and at some point the driver got out of the vehicle, and that\u2019s all you remember.\u201d Exactly. There\\'s more to the story. Let me start over. \\n\u201cThe next thing I knew, he was back in the cab. \\n\u2018Where you headed?\u2019 he asked me again.\u201d I told him to go to my sister\\'s house. He got out of the cab again. \\n\u201cI believe you about the driver getting out of the car, but I don\u2019t think you saw any aliens,\u201d says your sister. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d \\nYour sister doesn\u2019t believe that you were abducted by aliens. You have failed. Start Over \\n\u201cThe cabbie floored it, and pretty soon we were driving through the city on the way to my sister\u2019s house, which is where you live.\u201d We arrived, and I thanked the cabbie for his service. \\n\u201cWhen we arrived, I got out of the cab. The cabbie and I pointed at each other and waved goodbye in silence for three minutes.\u201d And that\\'s the end of my story. \\n\u201cWell, it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment, but I\u2019m sorry to say I\u2019m not convinced that you saw any aliens,\u201d says your sister. \u201cIs that really the whole story?\u201d Yes, that\\'s it. There was more. \\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t believe you saw any aliens.\u201d \\nOuch. You really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens. You are a miserable bard of the supernatural, and your sister didn\u2019t believe you at all. You have failed. Start Over \\nYour sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony\u2026 \\n\u201cIt began like any other night. I thought it was Guy Fawkes Night, so I was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself.\u201d I would light the firework, run back to safety, look up, and\u2026 \\n\u201c Boom! Good riddance, Sir Fawkes!\u201d It was so much fun, I decided to light another firework. I wasn\\'t having fun, but I decided to light another firework. \\n\u201cI lit the firework, stepped back, and looked up. I expected to see a sparkling skyrocket. What I saw was\u2026\u201d A sparkling skyrocket, just as I had expected. A strange light in the sky. \\n\u201cYes, it was a skyrocket. My expectation was on the money. \\nI prepared to launch another firework into the sky. I loaded it up, sprinted back to safety, and looked to the sky again, this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the Butcher\u2019s Delight\u2026\u201d And the Butcher\\'s Delight it was. And that\\'s when it happened. \\n\u201cI was right again. In the clear sky above me, I saw the firework called the Butcher\u2019s Delight. \\nI set up the last firework, drew a match, and lit the fuse. It was a quick fuse, so the firework had already launched by the time I turned around and looked up, thinking I would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the Salute to James Buchanan firework. But is that what I saw, looking to the skies?\u201d Yes, it was. It was not, for that was when it happened. \\n\u201cYes, my sibling. The Salute to James Buchanan firework exploded as planned. \\nI applauded at the fireworks finale, congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as I realized that I had bungled the Guy Fawkes date again.\u201d Then I went home. Then I came right to you. \\n\u201cThank you,\u201d says your sister. \u201dThat was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself. And did you see any aliens while you were at it?\u201d Yes. No. \\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe you. You only told me about fireworks. I was expecting to hear more about aliens.\u201d \\nYou have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens. Wait, I didn\\'t tell it right. Start Over \\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says your sister. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad nothing happened with aliens.\u201d \\nYou have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens. Wait, I didn\\'t tell it right. Start Over \\n\u201cA strange light appeared in the sky.\u201d I ran, but the strange light followed me. I couldn\\'t escape it. There was a sudden burst of futuristic light. \\n\u201cScience enveloped me.\u201d The light only got more futuristic. Then all of a sudden, I was standing on the UFO deck. \\n\u201cWhen the light faded, I noticed that I was on a spaceship. \\nThis part of the ship was clean and triangular.\u201d I noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity. I could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space. \\n\u201cOkay, I think I understand that you were on a spaceship,\u201d says your sister. \u201cGet to the aliens, though. How about some aliens in the story? When you were on the spaceship, were there any aliens that you saw?\u201d Yes. I don\\'t know, but my boss from my first job was there. \\n\u201cMy boss from my first job was there, and he was happy to see me.\u201d My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said \u201cYes, that seems right.\u201d My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said, \"No, that\\'s wrong,\" but it later turned out that he was right. \\n\u201cHmm,\u201d says your sister. \u201cIt sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens, you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. Could that be right?\u201d Yeah, that\\'s definitely right. Wait, I told the story wrong. Let me start over. \\nYou were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens, but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. You failed! Start Over \\n\u201cThere were aliens. A crowd of them. Huge, mighty creatures with skin like leather, hollow black eyes, and fearsome ivory fangs.\u201d The aliens were shouting at me, but I couldn\\'t understand what they were saying. \"JENCH CREV AMAMU!\" the aliens shouted, but I could not understand. \\n\u201cFrom among the aliens, a bigger alien stepped forth. I immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens, as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket.\u201d The mayor took out a device. \\n\u201cThe mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes. \\nSuddenly, I could hear everything differently.\u201d The mayor then seemed to speak to me in English. \\n\u201c\u2018Welcome to my UFO,\u2019 said the mayor. \u2018You are now wearing language glasses. They allow you to understand anything that we say in our language, but be careful: It doesn\u2019t work the other way around. If you want to learn how to talk like us, you\u2019ll need to visit the Language Room and earn a diploma from the language guide.\u2019\u201d I told the mayor that I understood. I told the mayor that I didn\\'t understand. I asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was. \\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying, but I\u2019m going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is. \\n\u2018To do that, I will need to tell you how the world works. In the universe, there are three kinds of things. First, there is us. We are called people. You can tell we\u2019re people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big, thick legs. It\u2019s obvious. \\n\u2018Second, there is God. God is special, secret, and far away, and there is only one of him. And we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever. We don\u2019t know where God is, but we are looking for him. \\n\u2018Last, there is rocks. Rocks is everything else. Planets are rocks. Spaceships are rocks. Since you are not a person, you are probably also a rock\u2026unless of course you are God. But that\u2019s very unlikely and illegal.\u2019\u201d I asked the mayor how to find out if I am a rock or if I am God. \\n\u201c\u2018I still can\u2019t understand you, but here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while. Go to the Language Room, learn our language, then come find me and we\u2019ll see if we can find a use for you.\u2019\u201d The mayor left, and I was alone with the crowd of aliens. \\n\u201cIn the spaceship\u2019s deck, the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about God and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last.\u201d I left the deck area and went south into the hallway. \\n\u201cIn the Language Room, a man was standing on a small, circular stage. \\nAbove him hung a giant banner that read \u2018LANGUAGE TUTORIAL FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS.\u2019\u201d He began the tutorial. \\n\u201c\u2018Welcome to this free alien-language tutorial for English speakers!\u2019 said the man. \u2018If you are viewing this in hologram form, it means our captors have determined I am no longer necessary, and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison. Right on!\u2019\u201d I waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram. I continued watching the presentation. \\n\u201cHe was not a hologram. \\n\u2018Ha! Not yet! I wish!\u2019 he said. \u2018Please sit down, and let\u2019s get this presentation over with!\u2019\u201d I sat back down and kept watching the presentation. \\n\u201c\u2018Let\u2019s begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language: the word CREV,\u2019 the man began. \\nHe gestured in the air beside him, where the word CREV appeared in red light. \\n\u2018CREV is a verb that roughly translates as \u201cto be about to point at something.\u201d If you want to communicate effectively with the aliens, it\u2019s an extremely important word to know.\u2019\u201d \"CREV,\" I managed to say. \"CREB,\" I blurted stupidly. \\n\u201c\u2018For example, to announce that I am ready to point at something, I would begin with the word AMAMU, which means \u201cme,\u201d then I would say, \u201cCREV,\u201d then I would say what I am pointing at.\u2019 \\n\u2018Like this: AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP.\u2019\u201d I looked where the man was pointing. I knew then that the man was pointing at Meryl Streep. \\n\u201c\u2018Hello!\u2019 said Meryl Streep. \u2018I am definitely a hologram.\u2019\u201d \"AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP,\" I said as I pointed at the Meryl Streep hologram. \\n\u201c\u2018Very good. The next word we\u2019re going to learn is important, but be aware that it is very politically charged. I am of course talking about the controversial word CREVV, and you must be very careful with it. It\u2019s a slur that means \u201cbad alien\u201d and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials.\u2019\u201d \"CREVV,\" I said. I nodded solemnly. I asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context. \\n\u201c\u2018Here is an example of CREVV used in English context: Oh God. The aliens are killing me. Why did I say CREVV? Why didn\u2019t someone teach me not to say CREVV? I shouldn\u2019t have said CREVV.\u2019\u201d I said, \"Okay.\" I said nothing. \\n\u201c\u2018CREVV,\u2019 I said. \\nNo sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place.\u201d I was dead. \\nYou wrap your story about the aliens \\n\u201cAh. So\u2026you died?\u201d your sister asks. Yeah. Wait, I didn\\'t tell the story right. Let me start over. \\n\u201cHmmm. I\u2026doubt it,\u201d says your sister. \\nYou told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died, but your sister doesn\u2019t seem convinced. \\nNo one believed you! You failed. Wait, I didn\\'t tell the story right. Start Over \\n\u201c\u2018At this point, you\u2019re almost conversant in the language. You just have a couple more words to get through. I am now teaching you the word JENCH. It means \u201cGod.\u201d\u2019\u201d I said, \"JENCH.\" \\n\u201cFinally, \u2018The word BRIDE is the equivalent of the English word \u201cum.\u201d When you say the word BRIDE, it means that you have forgotten how to speak, and you are trying to remember.\u2019\u201d I said, \"BRIDE.\" \\n\u201c\u2018This concludes this first and only module of alien language for English beginners. Thank you for learning with me. Get out there, start speaking the language, and remember: If I\u2019m not already dead, please find someone who will kill me!\u2019 \\nWith that, the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the Language Room.\u201d I left the Language Room and went back out to the ship hallway. I went east. \\n\u201cI was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room.\u201d I went north.'"}, "time": 1742562042.3854709}
