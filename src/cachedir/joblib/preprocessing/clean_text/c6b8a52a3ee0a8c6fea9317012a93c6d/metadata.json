The findings of the effects of abortion are startling,\u201d he continued. \u201c59 percent increased risk for suicidal thoughts. 61 percent increased risk for mood disorders. 61 percent increased risk for social anxiety disorders. 261 percent increased risk for alcohol abuse. 280 percent increased risk for any substance use disorder. \u201d \u201cIf the cause of this mental anguish were anything besides abortion, women would be marching   against it, and Madonna would be threatening to blow the White House up over it,\u201d MILO concluded. \u201cAbortion is clearly so bad for women\u2019s mental health that it falls second only to Islam, and maybe the fact that I\u2019m gay. \u201d Written from prepared remarks.'"}, "time": 1742564197.2118638}
