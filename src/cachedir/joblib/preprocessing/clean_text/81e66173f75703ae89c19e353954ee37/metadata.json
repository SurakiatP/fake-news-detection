[In the video below, Live Action investigators called Planned Parenthood affiliates throughout the country, asking if they could have an ultrasound to check on the health status of their unborn baby:   \u201cOh, we won\u2019t be able to tell you if it\u2019s healthy or the gender,\u201d says a Planned Parenthood staff member in Farmington, New Mexico. \u201cIf you\u2019re, you know  \u2014   we specialize in abortions. You know, that\u2019s what our ultrasounds are for, to see how far along the, um, patient is. \u201d At Planned Parenthood in St. Paul, Minnesota, a worker states, \u201cWe do [ultrasounds] when, um, when performing abor  \u2014   um, abortion procedures. \u201d In Corning, New York, a Planned Parenthood staff member explains, \u201cNo, we only do  \u2014   we only do ultrasounds if you are terminating. \u201d \u201cWe have to do an ultrasound with an abortion, but we don\u2019t offer them for  \u2014   we can\u2019t do anything to make sure that the pregnancy\u2019s fine,\u201d says a Planned Parenthood employee in St. Louis, Missouri. At a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday, Live Action President Lila Rose was joined by U. S. Reps. Diane Black ( ) Vicky Hartzler ( ) Ann Wagner ( ) Trent Franks ( ) Chris Smith ( ) Steve King ( ) and other members of Congress to promote the defunding of Planned Parenthood and the redirection of its taxpayer funds to other federally qualified healthcare centers that provide comprehensive services for women without abortions. \u201cThe reality is Planned Parenthood\u2019s focus for pregnant women is abortion,\u201d Rose said at the press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not   care. It\u2019s not serving young mothers, promoting them, supporting them it\u2019s abortion. \u201d \u201cWomen in our country deserve far better than abortion,\u201d she continued. \u201cFar better than to be seen as, \u2018You need abortion in order to achieve your dream, in order to live your life, in order to have your career and your family the way you want,\u2019 and we reject that. \u201d \u201cI can think of no organization in the recent history of the world that has deceived the world more than Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Rep. Franks, noting that the abortion chain\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, has claimed defunding Planned Parenthood would be harmful to women. \u201cLive Action\u2019s investigative video series has completely exploded this ridiculous lie,\u201d he added. \u201cThe truth is Planned Parenthood is the largest perpetrator of abortion in America, mercilessly killing some 300, 000 human babies a year. \u201d \u201cPlanned Parenthood is not interested in providing health care to women,\u201d said Rep. Hartzler. \u201cIts exclusive mission and its area of expertise is abortion. If Planned Parenthood\u2019s mission is to serve the health needs of women, they are failing miserably. \u201d Rep. King said Americans must look hard at the morality of abortion and the fact that \u201cwe are borrowing money from China to fund Planned Parenthood. \u201d \u201cIf we fail to [defund Planned Parenthood] during this 115th Congress, shame on us,\u201d he said. The first video of Live Action\u2019s new campaign exposed Planned Parenthood\u2019s marketing of   care in support of its bid for taxpayer dollars. The   group\u2019s investigators were turned away at 92 different facilities, where Planned Parenthood staff said they do not provide   care, but do specialize in abortions.'"}, "time": 1742564338.1687534}
