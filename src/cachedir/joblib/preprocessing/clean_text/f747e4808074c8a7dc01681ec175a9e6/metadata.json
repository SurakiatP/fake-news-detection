Adam Schiff ( ) said it is \u201cway premature\u201d to conclude that members of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.  \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say anything definitively at this point,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe are still at the very early stages of the investigation. The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this. We really need to find out exactly what the Russians did. Because one of the most important conclusions that the intelligence community reached is that they are going to do this again to the United States. They are doing it already in Europe. So we can say conclusively this is something that needs to be thoroughly investigated but it\u2019s way premature to be reaching conclusions. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563909.2611127}
