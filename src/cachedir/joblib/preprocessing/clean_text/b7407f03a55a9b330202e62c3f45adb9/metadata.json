In what was a natural result of last year\u2019s riveting playoff run by the club, almost 600, 000 additional fans poured through the turnstiles at Rogers Centre, leaving the Blue Jays with the   attendance figure in the majors this season, behind only the Los Angeles Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals. For many years before that, the Toronto stadium was often a   concrete shell (or more than  ) a place where the crack of ball on bat echoed around the cavernous confines. But as the Blue Jays regained their swagger last season and this, the building has sprung to life again. With that has come more noise and more excitement but also some unruly behavior and even claims of verbal abuse directed at opposing players. \u201cIt\u2019s hockey fans,\u201d said Jason Kipnis, the second baseman for the Cleveland Indians, who played the Blue Jays in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series on Monday night. \u201cAnd I mean that in the best way, because I\u2019m a hockey fan, too. But that\u2019s exactly what you want out of the fans. You want that little feeling, like that 1 percent feeling where I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m safe right here. \u201d That was actually the case in the Blue Jays\u2019   playoff game against the Baltimore Orioles. During that tense contest, a spectator threw a can of beer onto the field as the Orioles\u2019 Hyun Soo Kim settled under a fly ball in the seventh inning. The can flew about a foot behind Kim\u2019s head and landed on the field, its sudsy contents spewing out. Kim\u2019s teammate Adam Jones, playing center field, was irate and later said that he and Kim were victims of racial abuse from spectators, a claim corroborated by at least one fan in attendance. It was not the first time a projectile had been thrown onto the field at Rogers Centre. In 2013, a drink was hurled during a   game involving the Orioles. And last year, after a disputed umpiring call in Game 5 of an A. L. division series between the Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers, spectators showered the Rogers Centre field with plastic water bottles, beer cans and other items. It was a rowdy and unsettling scene, and it drew rebukes from both the Rangers and the Blue Jays. Bottles even came close to hitting Toronto Manager John Gibbons as he went out to argue the call. At the time, Gibbons made   remarks about almost getting hit on the head, but after the recent   game, his patience had run its course. \u201cEnough already,\u201d he said after that game. \u201cLet us handle things on the field. \u201d After the beer can was thrown at Kim, the atmosphere in the stadium intensified, and at least a few fans said they heard others yelling racially abusive remarks at Jones and Kim. Avi Miller, a    Orioles fan, said in a telephone interview Monday that he was at the   game and had heard people yelling at Kim, who is South Korean, to go back to his country, and other things directed at Jones that he said he was not comfortable repeating. \u201cI am convinced that 99 percent of the people who were booing were booing the person that threw the can of beer,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut some people around me took a very low approach and they were yelling at Kim. \u201cIt was disappointing to hear,\u201d he added. Miller, who said he had been to games at more than 20 major league stadiums, said he had heard similar invective in other venues. But at the recent   game, it was worse, he said, even if it lasted only a few minutes. Miller said he was sitting in Section 130 down the   line, in foul territory, facing the direction from which the can was thrown. After the episode, he said, fans began yelling back and forth, and he suspected that alcohol might have played a role. \u201cIt was   basically happening after the incident,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the people around me were very disappointed by it. They were annoyed by it, too. \u201d Asked if he heard racial abuse directed at Jones, he said, \u201cYes. \u201d On Oct. 7, three days after the game, the police in Toronto charged    Ken Pagan with mischief, saying he had thrown the can of beer. The arrest was made based on video and photographic evidence. Tyler Smith, Pagan\u2019s lawyer, said his client faced a court date Nov. 10, when the state will turn over the evidence. Smith also said Pagan had stopped working at the media outlet Postmedia in the aftermath of the arrest. Smith said that he could not comment on the case until he saw the evidence. \u201cThis has had a huge impact on him,\u201d Smith said Monday. \u201cHe was a guy who was well respected in his community, and now everyone is blaming him for the fact that beer is no longer served in cans at the games. He has a lot of enemies out there. \u201d The Blue Jays announced that for the remainder of the postseason, all beer would be poured into cups when sold to customers. Before Monday night\u2019s game, there had been one playoff game played at Rogers Centre since the   contest  \u2014   the Game 3   clincher in which the Blue Jays ousted the Rangers in a rematch from last year  \u2014   and no trouble was reported. In their announcement, the Blue Jays said enhanced security measures would be in place to prove a \u201csafe and enjoyable atmosphere. \u201d But it is also an atmosphere that has become a lot louder as the Blue Jays have revived on the field. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed here the last couple of years,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cThere\u2019s something to it. We feel it. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an easy place to play for an opponent. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563887.5669467}
