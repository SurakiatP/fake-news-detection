The source of this ridiculous whopper is the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), whose embarrassingly biased reports from partisan hacks are reflective of the mainstream \u201cnews\u201d outlets that cite the group as a legitimate source. \\nAny reasonable journalist can take the most cursory of glances at the silly report to see at best, that it is not a valid source. The \u201chateful intimidation and harassment\u201d cited by the SPLC are, of course, not listed and therefore cannot be subject to scrutiny. This information, according to SPLC , was \u201ccollected through news reports, social media, and direct submissions via SPLC\u2019s #ReportHate page\u201d and is \u201clargely anecdotal.\u201d \\nThe phrase \u201clargely anecdotal\u201d should be a clue for mainstream media sources reporting about the so-called spike in hate crimes. \\nWatch this report, which is based on the fake report from the SPLC: \\nThe New York Times , who recently pledged to be more honest or something, reported that \u201cattacks against American Muslims surged last year\u201d citing the FBI (which leads to a broken link at the time of this writing) and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which immediately makes their entire article suspect: \\n\u201cSince the election, hate crime monitors like the Southern Poverty Law Center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at schools, mosques and elsewhere.\u201d \\nThere is no evidence. There is no due process. There are no convictions. Yet the mainstream media has been parroting the lie that hate crimes have increased since Donald Trump\u2019s election. \\nMainstream journalists have resources. They have money, they have numerous researchers and they have a massive platform. Yet, these same organizations do not bother to use their vast resources to inform Americans of the truth about the SPLC\u2019s fake report. This is why they have lost the trust of the American people. \\nLast year, the SPLC had an \u201c operating budget \u201d of over $35 million dollars. They have an endowment fund of over $300 million dollars. \\nRead More: Gulag-wide Bulletins from Sovereignty Unbound We respect your privacy, time, and inbox.

As America threatens to shatter, we must see how a semi-covert, global, cartel collective and their NWO in the USA (\"progressive\" neo-Marxists and neo-fascists corporatists, updated with 21st Century techniques and technology) intentionally perpetrate this sabotage, while we patriots try to prevent it.

If it comes to it, do not even respond in kind, until after the after the first times that extreme, anti-American violence is done by them. It calls for an attitude of self sacrifice -- first cheek, second cheek, then no more. \\nAnd speak out about the potential and strategic \"sense\" of the Obama/NWO\\'s DHS carrying out false flag missions of violence, blaming it on American patriots, perhaps upon our militia movements. \\nWe are in a real war, right now (of which others and I have been trying to alert fellow Sovereign Citizens for years) and the prime war is for the minds, hearts, and wills of the American People. We are opposed by an anti-American insurrection using any means of power (see Gramsci, Frankfurt School) including government power, as they are granted that opportunity.'"}, "time": 1742561818.0069296}
