After weeks of assailing reporters and critics in diligent defense of their boss, Mr. Trump\u2019s team has been uncharacteristically muted this week when pressed about his explosive  \u2014   and so far    \u2014   Twitter posts on Saturday accusing President Barack Obama of tapping phones in Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. The accusation  \u2014   and the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, and the former national intelligence director, James R. Clapper Jr. emphatically deny that any such wiretap was requested or issued  \u2014   constitutes one of the most consequential accusations made by one president against another in American history. So for Mr. Trump\u2019s allies inside the West Wing and beyond, the tweetstorm spawned the mother of all messaging migraines. Over the past few days, they have executed what amounts to a strategic political retreat  \u2014   trying to publicly validate Mr. Trump\u2019s suspicions without overtly endorsing a claim some of them believe might have been generated by Breitbart News and other   outlets. \u201cNo, that\u2019s above my pay grade,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary and a feisty Trump loyalist, when asked on Tuesday at an   briefing if he had seen any evidence to back up Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation. The reporters kept at him, but Mr. Spicer pointedly and repeatedly refused to offer personal assurances that the president\u2019s statements were true. \u201cNo comment,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said earlier in the day. Last week, Mr. Sessions recused himself from any investigations involving the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said on CNN on Monday. Mr. Kelly shrugged and added that \u201cif the president of the United States said that, he\u2019s got his reasons to say it. \u201d Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate intelligence panel, have said they will add Mr. Trump\u2019s request to   inquiries into intelligence community leaks. But Mr. Nunes and Mr. Burr said they had not seen specific evidence backing up Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. Other Hill Republicans have responded with similar verbal shrugs. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said on Tuesday that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what the basis\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement was. Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts, viewed with amazement outside the West Wing bubble, often create crises on the inside. That was never truer than when Mr. Trump began posting from his weekend retreat at his    estate in Florida shortly after sunrise on Saturday. His groggy staff realized quickly that this was no typical Trump broadside, but an allegation with potentially   implications that threatened to derail a coming week that included the rollout of his redrafted travel ban and the unveiling of the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. It began at 6:35 a. m. with a Twitter post reading: \u201cTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d Three other posts quickly followed, capped by a 7:02 rocket that read: \u201cHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is  . Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d That led to a succession of frantic staff conference calls, including one consultation with the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, as staff members grasped the reality that the president had opened an attack on his predecessor. Mr. Trump, advisers said, was in high spirits after he fired off the posts. But by midafternoon, after returning from golf, he appeared to realize he had gone too far, although he still believed Mr. Obama had wiretapped him, according to two people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. He sounded defiant in conversations at    with his friend Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, Mr. Ruddy said. In other conversations that afternoon, the president sounded uncertain of the procedure for obtaining a warrant for secret wiretaps on an American citizen. Mr. Trump also canvassed some aides and associates about whether an investigator, even one outside the government, could substantiate his charge. People close to Mr. Trump had seen the pattern before. The episode echoed repeated instances in the 2016 presidential campaign. During the primary contests, Mr. Trump seized on a false National Enquirer article that raised a connection between the father of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Later, Mr. Trump justified it to skeptical campaign aides by saying, \u201cEven if it isn\u2019t totally true, there\u2019s something there,\u201d according to a former campaign official. Over the weekend, aides to Mr. Trump decided the only real solution to the presidential Twitter posts was to kick the allegations to Congress. On Sunday, Mr. Spicer issued a statement saying that the matter was effectively closed and that the president would not address it again until the intelligence committees had released their findings  \u2014   which could be many months away. But that has not quieted the uproar. Mr. Comey was incensed by Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation because it implied that the F. B. I. had broken the law, and he pressed the Justice Department, unsuccessfully, to deny it. On Tuesday, even as Mr. Spicer was telling reporters that the matter was above his pay grade, he said the president had \u201cabsolutely\u201d no intention of taking back his accusations. Mr. Trump has not spoken to Mr. Comey about the matter, Mr. Spicer said, offering a muted response when asked if the F. B. I. director retained the president\u2019s confidence. \u201cI have no reason to believe he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, adding that Mr. Trump \u201chas not suggested that to me. \u201d Mr. Spicer bristled when pressed by a reporter to weigh in on the veracity of the president\u2019s wiretapping allegation. \u201cI get that that\u2019s a cute question to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve tried to play this game before. I\u2019m not here to speak for myself. I\u2019m here to speak for the president of the United States and our government. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562571.3036077}
