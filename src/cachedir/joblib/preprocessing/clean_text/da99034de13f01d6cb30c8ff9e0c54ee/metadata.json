Killing suspects \u201cpersonally,\u201d he said, helped goad police officers  \u2014   \u201cjust to show to the guys that if I can do it, why can\u2019t you?\u201d _____ \u2022 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan welcomes President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for two days of talks, hoping for progress in a   territorial dispute. The meetings come against a backdrop of uncertainty in relations between the U. S. and China, and tensions over the evidence of Russian interference in the U. S. election on behalf of   Donald J. Trump. The top U. S. commander in the    Adm. Harry B.

Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. _____ \u2022 As part of his campaign to stimulate the economy, Mr. Trump and three of his children met with the leaders of the world\u2019s most elite and successful technology companies: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla and others.

Here\u2019s how you can protect yourself. \u2022 Japan removed a longstanding prohibition against gambling, amid projections of a $40 billion a year industry. \u201cJapan is seen as the crown jewel of Asian gaming development outside of Macau,\u201d an analyst said. \u2022 A giant American private equity group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is among a group of investors offering $5. 5 billion for Tatts Group, the Australian gambling operator. Tatts shares jumped on anticipation of a bidding war. \u2022 Meitu, best known for an app that beautifies selfies, begins trading in Hong Kong with a valuation in the vicinity of $5 billion, offering a gauge of international interest in Chinese  . \u2022 Amazon announced its first delivery by drone: an Amazon Fire streaming device and popcorn flown two miles from an English warehouse to a customer identified as Richard B.

S. blocked an arms deal to Saudi Arabia over concerns about civilian casualties in Yemen. [The New York Times] \u2022 The Pentagon tightened rules on combat for the second time this year, aiming to increase protections for civilians. [The New York Times] \u2022 Australia\u2019s Defense Department failed to account for nearly $200 million in spending over and above the service contracts for military bases. [Sydney Morning Herald] \u2022 Japanese officials pushed the U. S. military to ground its troubled   Osprey aircraft after one crashed off Okinawa. [Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 India\u2019s demonetization is having a disastrous effect on Nepal\u2019s already sagging economy.

S. might take from a work culture that weathered long years of a painfully damaged economy without unleashing destabilizing resentment. \u2022 Al Franken, a Democratic senator who once made a living satirizing politicians, envisions an unfunny future under the Trump administration. \u2022 And meet the Michael Jordan of darts. Michael van Gerwen, a    Dutchman, has won 25 tournaments this year and has been ranked No. 1 since 2014. Even so, he still has something to prove. The death of John Glenn has resurfaced memories of his famous orbit of Earth in 1962. Back then, there wasn\u2019t much debris to block his view or threaten his spacecraft. Not so anymore. Humans have created millions of pieces of   \u201cspace junk\u201d during the past 60 years of space exploration. While most are less than 10 centimeters in diameter, even tiny objects can threaten spacecrafts and communications satellites. \u201cGoing at 17, 500 miles per hour, a little marble can wipe out a space station,\u201d said John Crassidis, an University at Buffalo engineering professor. When bits of junk collide, they often break apart, creating more debris. Adding to the clutter are the abundance of satellites technology companies are launching these days. NASA has called for stronger international regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s a political mess,\u201d Dr. Crassidis said. Japan, though, is stepping forward to confront the challenge. Last week its national space agency launched a spacecraft featuring a   cable that can safely guide debris into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. If the mission works, it could lead to more innovative approaches, like one a Japanese entrepreneur, above, recently discussed with The Times. He wants his company to be the leader in extraterrestrial trash collection. Its slogan: Space Sweepers.
