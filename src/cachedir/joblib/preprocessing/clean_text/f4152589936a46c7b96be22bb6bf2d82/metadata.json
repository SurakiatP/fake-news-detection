Trump now leads Clinton 47.8% to 42.4% in this national tracking poll. And remember the methodology of this poll \u2013 it is a 7-day rolling average with over 3,004 participants. \\nTrump \u2013 in a single day \u2013 jumped up 9/10s of a percent, while Clinton fell 9/10ths of a percent \u2013 a huge one-day swing of 1.8% \u2013 and that\u2019s on top of yesterday\u2019s 1.7% swing. In fact, in the last 9 days, Trump has risen 4 full points, while Clinton has lost 2.7% \u2013 a 6.7% swing. \\nBoth candidates \u2013 Trump on the topside, and Clinton on the bottom side of this chart \u2013 are now well outside of the \u201c95% confidence interval\u201d. \\nAccording to the University of Southern California researchers running the ongoing Understanding America Study: \u201cFigures lying outside the gray band mean that we are at least 95% confident that the candidate with the highest percentage will win the popular vote.\u201d \\nBut in addition, the closer such a surge to election day, the more sure of that result we can be. There is now little doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote nationwide. \\nDigging down into the numbers shows where the biggest surge lies. Trump now leads in all 3 age categories. With millennials, Trump now leads by 2.6%. Among the middle aged, Trump now leads by a whopping 5.2%. But in the 65 and over group, Trump\u2019s lead has now widened to 9.6%. \\nWhen sorted by education, Trump enjoys a huge 18.1% lead among those with a high school education or less. A landslide is defined as a 10-point lead. \\nAmong those with some college, Trump leads by 12.3%. \\nEven among those with advanced degrees, Trump is closing the once-huge gap. Clinton still leads here in this demographically small group by 13.1%. \\nWhen sorted by income, Clinton still leads among those making $35k or less by 17.8%. \\nHowever, among the middle class \u2013 those with household incomes of between $35k and 75k, Trump leads by 15.9%. \\nAmong those making $75k or more, Trump leads by 11.4%. When sorted by ethnicity, Trump\u2019s lead among whites continues to increase, now at 25.9%. \\nThis poll\u2019s one blind spot continues to be among blacks. Although Trump made a .9% gain yesterday, Clinton still dominates with an 82.1% lead. \\nIn the \u201cother ethnicity\u201d group, Trump now leads by 9.2%. \\nAmong Latinos, Clinton still leads by 18.2%, however, Trump did increase by .6% points yesterday, while Clinton fell by .9 percent; a one-and-a-half percent swing. Among the ever-critical female vote, Trump closed the gap yesterday by 1.5%. Clinton\u2019s lead has been cut to 8.5%. \\nAmong men, Trump increased his lead yesterday by a full 2 percentage points. He now leads Crooked Hillary by 19.8% among men \u2013 more than double Clinton\u2019s lead with women. \\nI\u2019m still reporting from Washington. Good Day.
