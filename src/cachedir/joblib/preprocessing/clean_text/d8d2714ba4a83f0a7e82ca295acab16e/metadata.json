This enraged man began taunting members of the media with chants of \u201cJew S. A.\u201d in place of USA. This same rabid moron also accused members of the press who were simply doing their jobs of being \u201cthe enemy\u201d and \u201cworking for the devil.\u201d So this just happened near the press pen at Trump\\'s Phoenix rally.

They stop dreaming. They stop trying. Hillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped.\u201d \\nWhat is both maddening and simultaneously pathetic is that many of these enraged Trump voters are losers who need someone to blame their own inadequacies on. They are often poorly educated and have low-paying jobs. But then again, if you fail to educate yourself or prepare for the job market by learning a trade or getting a degree, that is at least in part your own fault. But to try and direct your anger at others\u2013be they African-Americans, Hispanics, or women\u2013only proves your own impotence. Rather than facing their failures and trying to better themselves, these narcissistic simpletons choose to hate those who set goals and accomplish them. \\nThe type of Trump supporter who shouted at members of the media in Phoenix cannot face one simple fact: He or she has a made a mess of their life and the pain is too much to take. Therefore they lash out at others with hatred and bile. They cannot face one simple fact: Their time has passed and the future has caught up with them, just as it will catch up with Donald Trump on November 8. \\nFeatured Image Via NBC News Screengrab  '"}, "time": 1742561784.7983303}
