They played baseball, and they also toured sites significant to the civil rights movement as a nod to the team\u2019s heritage  \u2014   it is named, after all, for the Kansas City Monarchs, the Negro leagues club for which Jackie Robinson once played. \u201cI stood where Martin Luther King and John Lewis stood,\u201d wrote outfielder Myles Eaddy on a team blog after a visit to Selma, Ala. adding, \u201cIt is really cool to know how far we have come. \u201d Nearly a year later, the team\u2019s trip has helped inspire an apology being extended by Philadelphia to Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball\u2019s color barrier when he made his debut for the Brooklyn Dodgers at the start of the 1947 season. The apology comes as Major League Baseball, on Friday, celebrates the 69th anniversary of Robinson\u2019s first game with the Dodgers with its Jackie Robinson Day, initiated in 2004. Every major league player wears Robinson\u2019s No. 42, an annual sight in baseball. What is different this year is the apology from the City of Philadelphia for the manner in which the Phillies treated Robinson when he began his career. \u201cObviously, everyone learns about Jackie Robinson when they\u2019re a schoolkid,\u201d said Helen Gym, the council member who introduced the resolution to apologize to Robinson, which passed unanimously. But Gym added that the Monarchs\u2019 tour of the South and the 2013 movie about Robinson\u2019s life, titled \u201c42,\u201d further piqued her interest and the City Council\u2019s in remembering Robinson and owning up to the Phillies\u2019 contribution to the hostility he initially encountered. Although the resolution refers to the racism Robinson encountered as a visiting player in Philadelphia, it is generally accepted that the worst behavior the Phillies displayed toward him actually occurred earlier that season, in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, during one of the Dodgers\u2019 early homestands. It was then that the Phillies, led by their manager, Ben Chapman, repeatedly shouted racial slurs at Robinson when he stepped to the plate, an encounter that was vividly portrayed in \u201c42. \u201d The City Council resolution states that Robinson was told to \u201cgo back to the cotton fields. \u201d According to Jonathan Eig, whose 2008 book \u201cOpening Day\u201d chronicled Robinson\u2019s rookie season, Chapman and several Phillies also made comments about Robinson\u2019s physical features. Robinson later said that it was the closest he came to cracking and retaliating. \u201cFor one wild and   minute, I thought, \u2018To hell with Mr. Rickey\u2019s noble experiment,\u2019 \u201d Robinson once recalled, referring to Branch Rickey, the Dodgers executive who chose Robinson as the player he felt capable of integrating the game while having the discipline to not retaliate to the taunts and harassment he would face. In those initial games against the Phillies, Robinson held in his anger. \u201cHe knew this wasn\u2019t just symbolism,\u201d Eig said. \u201cHe knew if he could integrate Major League Baseball, it would affect lots of people\u2019s lives. And he knew if he lashed out, he might lose the opportunity. \u201d For his part, Chapman would insist years later that the taunting was motivated less by racism than by a desire to gain a competitive advantage over a presumably fragile rookie. He told the writer Allen Barra that he had also used epithets against Joe DiMaggio, who was of Italian descent, and Hank Greenberg, who was Jewish. \u201cI can imagine the possibility that both things were true,\u201d Eig said of Chapman, \u201cthat he was deeply racist and he thought that by attacking a black guy with this racist language he might make him snap, lose his composure, get the player to take the bait, get him thrown out for half a season, get him to quit. \u201d In any case, the initial taunting of Robinson by Chapman and his players created a backlash. In the second game of that series, according to \u201cOpening Day,\u201d the Dodgers\u2019 Eddie Stanky, a scrappy infielder and Philadelphia native, confronted the Phillies, shouting at them and calling them cowards for verbally abusing someone who could not fight back. Commentators weighed in, expressing sympathy for Robinson. \u201cIt was the first time a lot of white people and white reporters in particular noticed the abuse Robinson was taking,\u201d Eig said, adding, \u201cI interviewed a fan who had been a teenager who went to one of those games, heard the heckling, and was shocked. \u201d Chapman had come under pressure from within baseball by the time the Dodgers paid their first visit to Philadelphia that season, from May 9 to 11, with Robinson unable to stay in the same hotel as his teammates. He asked to have his picture taken with Robinson. The two men posed stiffly, holding the same bat. All these years later, the City Council resolution seems like a more genuine gesture of atonement. \u201cI\u2019m sure Robinson would agree an apology is in order,\u201d Eig said.'"}, "time": 1742561947.5932045}
