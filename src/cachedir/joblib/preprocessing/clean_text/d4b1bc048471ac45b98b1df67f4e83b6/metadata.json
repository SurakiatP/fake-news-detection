The stages came together, and so did the voices. With this operatically    spectacle last week  \u2014   which drew squeals and flurries of smartphone photos as people passed on a vaporetto, or water bus  \u2014   Mr. Domingo became the latest classical star to shoot a cameo for \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d the Amazon comedy about a fictional New York orchestra. The series has managed to attract several galas\u2019 worth of classical headliners  \u2014   past episodes have featured the pianist Lang Lang playing   with the violinist Joshua Bell, the pianist Emanuel Ax shuffling his feet through an interactive dance video game, and the conductor Gustavo Dudamel. The show\u2019s ability to draw so many   is both a testament to its growing success, and a reflection of the fact that there are now far fewer opportunities for classical artists to appear on television, which is still an important medium for reaching, and appealing to, new audiences. \u201cI became a lot more famous,\u201d Mr. Domingo recalled as he waited in a nearby palazzo for the   shoot to begin, \u201cwhen I sang a duet with Miss Piggy. \u201d Over the years, Mr. Domingo, 75, has reached broader audiences with appearances like that one, singing with Miss Piggy on a \u201cNight of 100 Stars\u201d program in 1982, as well as in cameos on popular shows, including \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d and with his own television specials. But such opportunities have become rarer for musicians in recent years, drying up just as a rapidly changing media environment  \u2014   which is disrupting how politicians communicate, how people consume entertainment and news and how advertisers sell products  \u2014   is posing particular challenges for the classical field. For devoted fans, a strong case can be made that it is the best of times: Streaming services allow people at home to watch concerts by the Berlin Philharmonic and performances from the Salzburg Festival, the Vienna State Opera, the Metropolitan Opera and more. But it is harder than ever for classical stars to appear on   TV, leading to concerns that the field, always something of a niche when it comes to mass media, is becoming a more distant one at a time when music education is also on the wane. It was not always thus. In 1956, Elvis Presley was not the only superstar to make his debut on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d  \u2014   Callas did as well, with a lengthy excerpt from Puccini\u2019s \u201cTosca. \u201d NBC used to commission and televise new operas, including Gian Carlo Menotti\u2019s \u201cAmahl and the Night Visitors. \u201d The soprano Beverly Sills was not just a guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d but also a guest host. The   Marilyn Horne appeared on the \u201cThe Odd Couple. \u201d David Gockley, the veteran American impresario, said that those television appearances drove a wider interest in the art form  \u2014   and sold tickets. \u201cOur audience knew a lot of these names because they were on television,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the mainstream media paying much attention to opera these days, and it makes a difference. \u201d Peter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, said that dwindling television opportunities had forced the company to reach audiences in new ways  \u2014   both by starting its Live in HD cinema simulcasts and through social media. Last season, he said, the Met\u2019s videos were viewed about 7. 5 million times on Facebook and YouTube. \u201cWe have to create our own communications systems,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. There are exceptions. \u201cSesame Street\u201d still features classical musicians from time to time the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d has had dancers and musicians present clues and Stephen Colbert has invited ballet dancers and classical artists on both \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and \u201cThe Late Show. \u201d But those kinds of appearances are fewer and farther between. So \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d which some musicians and critics initially rolled their eyes at, has taken on an importance to classical music that grew after the show won two Golden Globes this year. The show, of course, has Mozart in its title, and is loosely based on the 2005 memoir of the same name by Blair Tindall, an oboist who set out to explore, in the words of her subtitle, \u201cSex, Drugs and Classical Music. \u201d So a good portion of the viewers who stream it may already be music fans. But with a cast that includes stars like Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Bernadette Peters, Malcolm McDowell, Lola Kirke and, in a small role, Jason Schwartzman, the series also draws viewers who may not (yet) have subscriptions to their local orchestras. Paul Weitz, who was directing the episode with Mr. Domingo and is an executive producer of the show with Roman Coppola and Mr. Schwartzman, said that the possibility of reaching those viewers was especially enticing to the musicians who have appeared. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a huge issue, and it\u2019s something that is dealt with in the show a lot, about whether classical music is going to be passed on to a new generation,\u201d Mr. Weitz said between shots in his director\u2019s chair. \u201cAnd all these artists, the reasons that they\u2019re doing this show is because they feel like it\u2019s good for that aspect of the art  \u2014   that it can bring the music to different people. And anecdotally, I think that\u2019s actually the case. \u201d Mr. Domingo, who moved to Mexico as a child and maintains strong ties there, said that he was drawn partly by the chance to appear with Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal, a Mexican actor whose career he has followed since the film \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d more than a decade ago, and partly because he was intrigued by a new series that shines a light on the field. So Mr. Domingo, who remains one of the hardest workers in opera, recorded his vocals for the duet, \u201cL\u00e0 ci darem la mano,\u201d this month at a midnight session at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, right after finishing a performance there in the title role of Verdi\u2019s \u201cSimon Boccanegra. \u201d (The soprano part, which Ms. Bellucci, who is playing a fiery diva known as La Fiamma,   to, was recorded in San Francisco by the rising star Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez.) And last week he flew here for a   shoot, the day after singing in Verdi\u2019s \u201cI Due Foscari\u201d at Teatro Real in Madrid, where he sang the role of the Doge of Venice. \u201cWhen I finished,\u201d he said, \u201cI said, \u2018Tomorrow I\u2019ll go to my city to see how my people are behaving. \u2019\u201d The coming \u201cMozart\u201d season will also shine a spotlight on contemporary music, with a cameo by Nico Muhly, the young American composer whose opera \u201cTwo Boys\u201d was staged at the Met in 2013. He wrote a piece for the show  \u2014   an aria from an imaginary opera based on the story of Amy Fisher, who at the age of 17 became known as the Long Island Lolita after shooting and severely wounding the wife of her lover. Mr. Weitz said that the aria struck the tone he strove for in the show  \u2014   mixing ridiculous and comic elements with sublime moments, through music. \u201cNico\u2019s fake Amy Fisher opera actually achieves that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely preposterous and silly and at the same time  \u2014   and this was very important, it\u2019s what I was hoping for  \u2014   it\u2019s actually moving. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628391.2364929}
