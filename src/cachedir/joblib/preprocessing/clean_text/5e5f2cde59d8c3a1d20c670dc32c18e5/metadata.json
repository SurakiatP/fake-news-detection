Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nA new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. \\nCNBC reported : FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI\u2019s name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former FBI official tells CNBC. \\n\u2026. \\nAccording to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: \u201cA foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election.\u201d Comey\u2019s position, this official said, was \u201cif it is said, it shouldn\u2019t come from the FBI, which as you\u2019ll recall it did not.\u201d \\nDirector Comey didn\u2019t want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but he had no qualms about sending a letter to Congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. \\nWith each new revelation and detail, it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that FBI Director Comey may have violated the Hatch Act with his letter to Congress. It is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. \\nWhen the information was bad for Donald Trump, Comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. However, he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \\nIt is becoming clear that Comey has abused his power and must be removed as FBI Director immediately.\""}, "time": 1742563665.880522}
