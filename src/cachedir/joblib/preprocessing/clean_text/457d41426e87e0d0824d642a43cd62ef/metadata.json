We capture that again when we drill, baby, drill!\u201d  Trump\u2019s executive order directs the U. S. Department of the Interior to review the   bans to allow \u201cresponsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our treasury and jobs to our workers. \u201d Obama\u2019s prohibition on new drilling in U. S. water around Alaska includes most of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, and in 31 underwater canyons in the Atlantic Ocean. President Obama enacted it last December under using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority to designate certain offshore areas unavailable for commercial use. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton also invoked the legislation. President Trump said that the offshore drilling ban harms the economy. He explained, \u201cOur country\u2019s blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves, but the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production. \u201d Trump added, \u201cThis deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562297.942304}
