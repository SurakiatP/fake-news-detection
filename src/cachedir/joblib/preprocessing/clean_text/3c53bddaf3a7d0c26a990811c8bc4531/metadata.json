They have all but admitted what we already know\u2013a 2,000-mile physical wall is simply not feasible. \\nWell, we got more confirmation earlier this week from another prominent Trump surrogate. Specifically, his chief foreign policy adviser admitted what we have long suspected\u2013when Trump declares, \u201cI\u2019m building a wall,\u201d he\u2019s just engaging in campaign hype. \\nPeople for the American Way\u2019s Right Wing Watch noticed that on Monday, veteran foreign policy and terrorism expert Walid Phares sat down with France 24\u2019s Surabhi Tandon to discuss Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy. Phares served as a top foreign policy adviser to the Mitt Romney campaign, and took up the same role with Trump. He is best known as an ardent Islamophobe who had close ties to extremist militia groups during the civil war in his native Lebanon. \\nThe conversation soon turned to Trump\u2019s wall. Right Wing Watch got a clip. \\nTandon asked Phares how Trump\u2019s planned wall would affect the United States\u2019 relationship with Mexico; Trump has let it be known that one way or another, Mexico will foot the bill for the wall. Phares replied that Trump plans to build the wall along the American side of the border. However, as far as he knows, it won\u2019t be a brick-and-mortar wall. \u201cNow, will we see a physical wall on hundreds and hundreds of miles of border? I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \\nAccording to Phares, what Trump has in mind is something like what exists in Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in north Africa. He claimed that there was a simple concept in place in those cities for anyone who wanted to cross into Spain via Morocco\u2013\u201cyou come, you knock on the door, you have your paper, and you come in.\u201d \\nTandon pounced, reminding Phares that Trump has been clamoring for a physical wall for the entire campaign. But this major Trump surrogate apparently didn\u2019t get the memo. Phares claimed that Trump only talked about building a wall \u201cto raise the attention.\u201d However, since then, Phares has said that Trump has \u201cevolved the concept\u201d of a wall. How so? \u201cMeaning, \u2018If nothing is done, I\u2019m going to go back to square one and build a wall. But if I can start talking with the Mexicans, I may not have to do all the wall everywhere because the Mexican government is going to finally send troops to stop these cartels.'\u201d \\nBut wait a minute. Trump himself has declared the wall will stretch along the entire border. And he even managed to get the wall into the Republican platform. See for yourself , on page 26: \u201c(W)e support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\u201d \\nAnd yet, a major Trump surrogate\u2013indeed, his top surrogate on foreign policy\u2013has effectively left his candidate on an island. \\nWatch the whole thing here ; the exchange about the wall begins at the 6:30 mark. As I write this on Wednesday night, I can find no evidence that either Trump or the RNC has spoken up to correct the record. And I can find no evidence that Phares himself has tried to clarify his remarks. I can only conclude one thing\u2013Trump himself knows he\u2019s not building a wall.
