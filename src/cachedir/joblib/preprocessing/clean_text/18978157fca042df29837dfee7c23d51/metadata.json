He was 89. The cause was multiple myeloma, his wife, Julie Blatty, said. \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d the story of a    girl possessed by a demon, was published in 1971 and sold more than 13 million copies. The 1973 movie version, starring Linda Blair and directed by William Friedkin, was a runaway hit, breaking   records at many theaters and becoming the   film to date for Warner Bros. studios. It earned Mr. Blatty, who wrote the screenplay, an Academy Award. (It was also the first horror movie nominated for the   Oscar.) \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d marked a radical shift in Mr. Blatty\u2019s career, which was already well established in another genre: He was one of Hollywood\u2019s leading comedy writers. Mr. Blatty collaborated with the director Blake Edwards on the screenplays for four films, beginning in 1964 with \u201cA Shot in the Dark,\u201d the second movie (after \u201cThe Pink Panther\u201d) starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau and, in some critics\u2019 view, the best. His other Edwards films were the comedy \u201cWhat Did You Do in the War, Daddy?\u201d (1966) the musical   \u201cDarling Lili\u201d (1970) and \u201cGunn\u201d (1967) based on the television detective series \u201cPeter Gunn. \u201d He also wrote the scripts for comedies starring Danny Kaye, Warren Beatty and Zero Mostel. In praising his 1963 novel, \u201cJohn Goldfarb, Please Come Home! ,\u201d a Cold War spoof that Mr. Blatty later adapted for the screen, Martin Levin of The New York Times invoked the humorist S. J. Perelman, one of Mr. Blatty\u2019s literary idols Mr. Blatty, he said, \u201cwrites like Perelman run amuck. \u201d The phenomenal success of \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d essentially signaled the end of Mr. Blatty\u2019s comedy career, making him for all practical purposes the foremost writer in a new hybrid genre: theological horror. It was a mantle he was never entirely comfortable wearing. When he declined his publisher\u2019s entreaties for a sequel to \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and instead delivered an elegiac memoir about his mother, \u201cI\u2019ll Tell Them I Remember You,\u201d published in 1973, Mr. Blatty felt the first cinch of the   straitjacket. \u201cMy publisher took it because I wanted to do it,\u201d he was quoted as saying in \u201cFaces of Fear\u201d (1985) a collection of interviews with horror writers by Douglas E. Winter. \u201cBut the bookstores were really hostile. \u201d \u201cThe sad truth is that nobody wants me to write comedy,\u201d he said in another interview. \u201c \u2018The Exorcist\u2019 not only ended that career it expunged all memory of its existence. \u201d Mr. Blatty gave various accounts of what led him to try his hand at horror. He sometimes said the market for his comedy had waned in the late 1960s, and he was ready to move on. At other times, he said that his mother\u2019s sudden death in 1967 had led to a renewed commitment to his Roman Catholic faith, and to a soul searching about life\u2019s ultimate questions, including the presence of evil in the world. In every account, he said the idea for \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d was planted in 1949, when he was a student at the   Georgetown University in Washington and read an account in The Washington Post of an exorcism under the headline \u201cPriest Frees Mt. Rainier Boy Reported Held in Devil\u2019s Grip. \u201d The incident, widely discussed at the time among Georgetown students and faculty members, came back to Mr. Blatty 20 years later as the basis for a book about something not getting much press in the fractured, murky landscape of   America: the battle between Good and Evil. He began writing what he thought would be a   thriller about a girl, a demon and a pair of Catholic priests. About halfway through, he later said, he sensed he had something more. \u201cI knew it was going to be a success,\u201d he told People magazine. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to finish it and become famous. \u201d William Peter Blatty was born on Jan. 7, 1928, in Manhattan to Peter and Mary Blatty, immigrants from Lebanon. His father left home when he was 6, and his mother supported the two of them by selling quince jelly on the streets, yielding a wobbly income that precipitated 28 changes of address during a childhood he once described as \u201ccomfortably destitute. \u201d The church figured prominently in his life. His mother was a churchgoing Catholic, and he was educated at prominent   schools that admitted him on full scholarships: the Brooklyn Preparatory School, now closed, where he was the 1946 class valedictorian, and Georgetown, from which he graduated in 1950. After serving in the Air Force, Mr. Blatty worked for the United States Information Agency in Beirut. He returned to the United States for a public relations job in Los Angeles, where he hoped to begin his career as a writer. He had already published his first book  \u2014   a memoir, \u201cWhich Way to Mecca, Jack?\u201d  \u2014   but was still working in public relations in 1961 when he appeared as a contestant on \u201cYou Bet Your Life,\u201d the television quiz show hosted by Groucho Marx. He and a fellow contestant won $10, 000. His winnings freed him to quit his day job and become a   writer. He never had a regular job again. Mr. Blatty lived in Bethesda. In addition to his wife, the former Julie Witbrodt, whom he married in 1983, he is survived by their son, Paul William Blatty three daughters, Christine Charles, Mary Joanne Blatty and Jennifer Blatty and two sons, Michael and William Peter Jr. from earlier marriages seven grandchildren and six  . Another son, Peter Vincent Blatty, died in 2006 his death was the subject of Mr. Blatty\u2019s 2015 book, \u201cFinding Peter. \u201d His work after \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d included several more theologically themed works of horror, including \u201cThe Ninth Configuration\u201d in 1978 (a reworking of \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane,\u201d from 1966)  \u2014   and \u201cLegion\u201d in 1983. Both books were made into movies, directed as well as written by Mr. Blatty the film version of \u201cLegion\u201d was released in 1990 as \u201cThe Exorcist III. \u201d Mr. Blatty became reconciled over the years to the overwhelming dominance \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d  \u2014   most recently adapted into a 2016 TV    \u2014   would have on his reputation as a writer. (He also maintained a sense of humor about it, as reflected in the name of a comic novel about Hollywood he published in 1996: \u201cDemons Five, Exorcists Nothing. \u201d) He knew, he told several interviewers, that it would be what people remembered him for. But one thing bothered him. Many moviegoers, including the president of Warner Bros. had interpreted the movie\u2019s climax  \u2014   in which the younger of the two priests (played by Jason Miller) goads the demon into leaving the girl to take up residence inside him instead, then jumps to his death  \u2014   as a win for the demon. That was not how Mr. Blatty meant it. For years he pleaded his case to Mr. Friedkin, a longtime friend. In 2000, Mr. Friedkin relented, issuing a   director\u2019s cut of the film that made the triumph of Good over Evil more explicit. With the same purpose in mind, Mr. Blatty rewrote parts of the original book, even adding a chapter, for a   edition of \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d published in 2011. It was essential to him, he told The   of New Orleans in 2000, that people understand the point of \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d: \u201cThat God exists and the universe itself will have a happy ending. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628471.9116359}
