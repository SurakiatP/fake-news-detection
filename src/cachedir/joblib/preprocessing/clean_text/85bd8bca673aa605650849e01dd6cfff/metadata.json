But more than one member of this   reading group in Marin County, Calif. got squeamish when the host announced that the taco appetizers he had prepared that night were filled with   Rocky Mountain oysters  \u2014   that is, animal testicles. \u201cThe fun part was looking at the expressions,\u201d said the club\u2019s founder, Andrew McCullough, 53. \u201cSome guys had real difficulty swallowing. I kept eating. I have standards I need to adhere to, as secretary and founder. \u201d The Man Book Club is going into its ninth year. It has 16 members, a number of whom are lawyers and engineers in their  . Each month, the host must prepare a meal appropriate to the book under discussion. There was an   French supper to accompany Henry Miller\u2019s \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d and a meal of refined comfort food presented on TV trays for Bill Bryson\u2019s   memoir, \u201cThe Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid. \u201d \u201cI was always a little jealous of my wife\u2019s book clubs,\u201d Mr. McCullough said. \u201cNow our wives are jealous of us. We\u2019ve created something that is more durable. The book club my wife belongs to  \u2014   there\u2019s a lot of changeover. \u201d Women, it seems, can afford to drop in and out of reading groups. In its 2011 survey of voluntary organizations, the Pew Research Center found that 11 percent of Americans were active in \u201cliterary, discussion or study groups such as book clubs\u201d and that women were more than twice as likely to take part in such gatherings as men were. Perhaps because participation in reading groups is perceived as a female activity, some   book clubs have an outsize need to proclaim the endeavor\u2019s masculinity. In addition to going by the name the Man Book Club, for instance, Mr. McCullough\u2019s group expresses its notion of manliness through the works it chooses to read. \u201cWe do not read   chick lit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main character cannot be a woman. \u201d This is detailed in the Man Book Club\u2019s criteria, on the group\u2019s website: \u201cNo books by women about women (our cardinal rule)\u201d. The members of the club rate books on a scale of 1 to 10. The leader, with a score of 8. 8, is \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d by Richard Russo the   book, at 3. 3, is \u201cOscar and Lucinda\u201d by Peter Carey. Another   reading group, this one with a name even more insistently macho than that of the Man Book Club, is the International Ultra Manly Book Club, of Kansas City, Kan. It was started by a group of college friends, and its website hammers home its   identity through prominent images of Chuck Norris, Dwayne Johnson (better known as the Rock) and Oprah Winfrey, standing before an Oprah\u2019s Book Club logo beneath the legend \u201cNot Your Mother\u2019s Book Club. \u201d Unlike the Marin County group, the International Ultra Manly Book Club is not big on the   element. When one of its members does bring food to one of the monthly   it tends to be \u201cmanly  \u2014   like, spicy,\u201d said John Creagar, 32, one of the regulars. In explaining the club\u2019s purpose, the International Ultra Manly Book Club website makes explicit the notion that men take literature as seriously as women. The \u201cAbout Us\u201d section says it was founded, in part, on the vision that \u201cone day we could step out of the shadow of our mothers\u2019 book clubs and proclaim that yes, we too, are intellectuals. \u201d If that mission statement seems a tad defensive, there are indeed women who treat book clubs as entities that lie beyond the masculine sphere. Two years ago, Edward Nawotka, 44, a writer and editor in Houston, was out for drinks with the guys from his reading group, the Houston Men\u2019s Book Club, when a woman started hitting on its president. \u201cShe asked how we knew each other, and when we said, \u2018book club,\u2019 she was like, \u2018Wait, are you gay? \u2019\u201d Mr. Nawotka said. (He added that he and the woman ended up dating.) He said he understood her reaction. \u201cFiction is designed to examine empathy,\u201d Mr. Nawotka said. \u201cMen aren\u2019t encouraged to talk about their feelings or emotions in public. When your friend gets divorced, you don\u2019t sit around with the guys wondering, \u2018How do you think Jon feels about getting divorced? \u2019\u201d But over discussions of Jos\u00e9 Saramago, Haruki Murakami and Anthony Doerr, the 15 members of his group have formed a bond. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other through family tragedies,\u201d Mr. Nawotka said. \u201cWhen I needed a divorce attorney, I turned to these guys. \u201d And when the founding member\u2019s wife died from cancer, all the club members attended the funeral. Jon Tomlinson is the founder of the NYC Gay Guys\u2019 Book Club, which meets at the Jefferson Market Library in New York City and has 1, 200 members in its Meetup. com group. Anywhere from 10 to 60 men show up at the monthly meetings. \u201cPeople come to connect, to find their place in a new city, to fall in love,\u201d Mr. Tomlinson said. Especially popular NYC Gay Guys\u2019 Book Club novels have included \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room\u201d by James Baldwin, \u201cA Single Man\u201d by Christopher Isherwood and \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d by Donna Tartt, Mr. Tomlinson said. The selection process, he added, is largely democratic, but at times he feels obligated to vet suggestions. \u201cSome guy wanted to read a   book on lesbians who were persecuted in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get people to read that book. \u201d For the International Ultra Manly Book Club, in Kansas City, the monthly meetings provide a space to explore literary depictions of what it means to be a man. The regulars have considered the issue while discussing everything from \u201cAbraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\u201d by Seth   to \u201cRabbit, Run\u201d by John Updike. \u201cManliness means something different for all of us,\u201d Mr. Creagar said. But all the members share a love of books. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that if guys read, we don\u2019t think that deeply about it,\u201d Mr. Creagar said. The club rates the books it reads on a   system for overall quality, and on a    system for \u201cmanliness. \u201d \u201cGilead,\u201d by Marilynne Robinson, for instance, earned four and a half stars and three hand grenades. Mr. Creagar suspects there are many male readers who would love to join a book club. \u201cBut they don\u2019t get asked,\u201d he said, \u201cor they worry that, if they do join, they\u2019ll be seen as intruding on a female activity or stigmatized as being the only guy. \u201d For this reason, the International Ultra Manly Book Club sees itself as a resource for men seeking a literary community. In addition to listing its reading schedule, its site includes \u201cbest of\u201d lists, including the \u201cTop 100 Books for Every Man. \u201d Though it includes rough stuff like \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\u201d by Hunter Thompson and \u201cBlood Meridian\u201d by Cormac McCarthy, the list has room for gentler works, like \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d by C. S. Lewis and the Harry Potter series. And yet the group has standards. \u201cWe are not allowed to suggest books that our mothers have suggested,\u201d Mr. Creagar said. \u201cWe had an accident one time. We read \u2018Water for Elephants.\u2019 It was a huge mistake. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564596.9191868}
