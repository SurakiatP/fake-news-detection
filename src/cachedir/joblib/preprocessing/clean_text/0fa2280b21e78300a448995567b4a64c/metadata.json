Darren Salter, the senior coroner for Oxfordshire County, said Mr. Michael, 53, died at his home in    of natural causes: dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver. Dilated cardiomyopathy develops when the heart\u2019s ventricles enlarge and weaken, a process that usually starts in the left ventricle. The weakening of the heart\u2019s chambers causes the heart muscle to work harder, and over time that reduces its ability to pump blood. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. Fat buildup in the liver can be caused by drinking alcohol, but there is also a common nonalcoholic variant that is related to being overweight or obese. Mr. Michael had a history of hard living: In 2007 he was sentenced to community service and barred from driving for two years after he was found asleep behind the wheel of a car while under the influence of drugs. The following year, he was arrested on suspicion of possessing crack cocaine. Mr. Salter\u2019s statement did not specify the cause of the fat building in the liver. Because the death was natural, \u201cthe investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further enquiries,\u201d Mr. Salter said in a statement. \u201cNo further updates will be provided and the family requests the media and public respect their privacy. \u201d Mr. Michael, who was born in London to a British mother and a Greek Cypriot father, started the group Wham! with a high school friend, Andrew Ridgeley. The pair became household names with the 1984 single \u201cWake Me Up Before You  . \u201d They split up in 1986, and Mr. Michael began a solo career with his album \u201cFaith,\u201d released in 1987. His final studio album featuring new songs was \u201cPatience\u201d in 2004. On Monday, Mr. Michael was celebrated at Paris Fashion Week when the designer Stella McCartney closed her show with a procession of models dancing to his song \u201cFaith\u201d and chanting the words \u201clove\u201d and \u201cfaith. \u201d Mr. Michael had famously cast five supermodels who had appeared together on the cover of British Vogue  \u2014   Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz  \u2014   in the David   video for his 1990 song \u201cFreedom! \u201990. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563103.7992837}
