Though Ford Motors were resistant to Trump\u2019s trade policy positions and threatened to move jobs to Mexico, the CEO has now announced that, instead, production will remain American. \\nIs Trump pulling televangelist-style miracles \u2013 with arrangements ahead of time in the back room \u2013 or is he making things happen because he is in a position to make good on his policy promises? Either way, Ford and other big companies will be keeping optics in mind when they decide whether or not to play ball with the wild card Trump administration (at this point, still to be). If this actually becomes the trend, perhaps there is a lot of positive that can be done for the economy, and perhaps good paying jobs can return for struggling working class Americans. Only time will tell, but he hasn\u2019t even assumed office yet. \\nFord CEO Folds? Trump Confirms Carmaker Won\u2019t Move Production To Mexico \\nby Tyler Durden\\nJust hours after Ford CEO complained of the \u201chuge impact\u201d of Donald Trump\u2019s proposed trade plans, following the company\u2019s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan, Donald Trump tweeted \u201cJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky \u2014 no Mexico,\u201d seemingly winning his first \u2018america-first\u2019 victory.\\nAs WSJ reported yesterday, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.\\nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, \u201cWe all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.\u201d \\nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.\\nFord\u2019s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.\\nAnd then hours later, Donald Trump tweeted\u2026\\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky \u2013 no Mexico\\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \\n\\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \\n\\nWhich was followed by a statement from Ford confirming Trump\u2019s comment\u2026\\nThis article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge . \\n'"}, "time": 1742564455.2244697}
