They went viral before going viral was a thing  \u2014   their undergraduate years coincided with the birth of Facebook, and the first song cycle Benj Pasek and Justin Paul wrote, called \u201cEdges,\u201d was discovered, shared and performed by musical theater majors around the country. Now, at the age of 31, after a decade of being touted as promising,    and    Pasek and Paul have arrived. Their first original musical, \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d a daringly   show that explores the charged interplay between collective grief and social media after a misconstrued high school suicide, begins previews Monday, Nov. 14 and is generating prize chatter even before it opens on Broadway Dec. 4. Five days later, their first   Hollywood movie, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d a romantic Ryan   Stone musical fantasia for which they wrote the lyrics, opens that film was the hit of this year\u2019s festival circuit. But that\u2019s not all. In an era in which the film and television industries are showing a renewed interest in musicals, they have written all the songs for a movie starring Hugh Jackman  \u2014   a P. T. Barnum biopic called \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d  \u2014   which is now in rehearsal and scheduled for release late next year by 20th Century Fox. Disney has hired them to write new songs for a   remake of \u201cSnow White. \u201d Oh, and they even have a song in \u201cTrolls,\u201d the DreamWorks Animation comedy that opened early this month. \u201cI love them,\u201d said Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, who hired the pair to write three songs for the television show \u201cSmash,\u201d and became so enamored that he is now a   on \u201cDear Evan Hansen. \u201d \u201cTo me, they\u2019re the future of the musical, on stage or screen. \u201d Musical theater history is peopled by   pairings. And even before they graduated from the University of Michigan, Pasek and Paul  \u2014   that\u2019s the branding they fell into as    their surnames in alphabetical order  \u2014   have been prospectively placed in the pantheon. \u201cRodgers  Hart. Lerner  Loewe. Pasek  Paul? It has a nice ring to it,\u201d said a university publication in 2006. They are handsome and charming,   and exuberant, observant, obsessive, and, of course, neurotic. Mr. Pasek writes words, and Mr. Paul writes music, but they have opted, right from the beginning, to share credit for both elements of their songs. They estimate that they spend 350 days a year together, for six to 12 hours at a stretch, sending texts and video clips back and forth when they are not in the same room, and even sometimes when they are. \u201cEverything that we\u2019ve studied and loved has all built to get to be in a moment like this,\u201d Mr. Paul said during a joint interview at Sardi\u2019s, surrounded by caricatures of the industry\u2019s greatest talents. \u201cOur goal was always, if we could just write songs and tell stories, and get to do that every day, that\u2019s our dream. \u201d [A Pasek and Paul primer: six videos to watch] Although their sensibility is contemporary, they are deeply rooted in the musical theater tradition, and their sound is somewhere on the border between show tunes and pop  \u2014   they are not part of the   revolution on Broadway. They have proven especially deft at musicalizing emotional yearning: The 11 o\u2019clock number in \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d is a poignant effort by an apologetic single mother (Rachel Bay Jones) to comfort her disconsolate son (Ben Platt). In \u201cLa La Land,\u201d the climactic song is a stirring recollection by an aspiring actress (Ms. Stone) reflecting on inspiration at a casting call. \u201cI think we\u2019re attracted to material that\u2019s hopeful and messy, and in that mess, there\u2019s an attempt at getting at truth,\u201d Mr. Pasek said. They are, on the surface, quite different from each other. Mr. Paul, who lives in Harlem, is a churchgoing Christian from Westport, Conn. straight married and the father of a    daughter. Mr. Pasek, who grew up in Ardmore, Pa. and now lives on the Upper West Side, is gay, Jewish and single. But they both began as little boys who loved to sing. Mr. Paul, a talented pianist, started early. At age 3, he was singing gospel music with his father, a pastor, in church. Later, he sang and danced at senior centers with Music Theater of Connecticut and then, at Staples High School, he performed in \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d conducted the orchestra in \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d and spent his free time poring over Broadway \u201cfake books,\u201d which help pianists master melodies. Mr. Pasek also sang with a parent: His mother is a developmental psychologist and professor with a propensity for bursting into song. (\u201cShe\u2019s like a   musical theater character, in the best possible way,\u201d he said.) She wrote and performed songs from a child\u2019s point of view (\u201cThey were a big hit on the synagogue circuit,\u201d he said) and he remembers guest starring with her at about age 7. Mr. Pasek sang and traveled with the Philadelphia Boys Choir  Chorale, and then, as a student at Friends Central School, performed in musicals including \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d and \u201c42nd Street. \u201d They compare themselves to brothers, who bicker and bond, knowing their relationship will endure. A recent fight, over whose bad habits were to blame for their difficulty replacing the final first act song in \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d sent Mr. Pasek stalking out of their Columbus Circle studio into the street, but then, 10 minutes later, calling Mr. Paul for a lengthy   that prompted the pair to ditch the disputed number and start over. Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul met the summer before college, at a freshman orientation weekend, and connected over a shared sense of humor, a passion for the work of Jason Robert Brown and an obsession with \u201cMerrily We Roll Along. \u201d (The title \u201cEdges\u201d alludes to a \u201cMerrily\u201d lyric.) Mr. Pasek wanted to record some songs he had written as a high school senior, and he recruited Mr. Paul as an arranger and accompanist with that, their collaboration began. They mined their own experiences, and those of their friends, for material, acting out songs as they wrote. \u201cI kept watching them observe the social experiment of college and find ways to articulate it,\u201d said Nick Blaemire, a fellow Michigan student who is now an actor in New York, recalling a night when he told Mr. Pasek about his difficulty expressing love to a girlfriend, and seeing that become \u201cI Hmm You. \u201d Raised in the digital age, and aware of the role social media played in fueling their popularity, they have demonstrated an ease promoting their work  \u2014   at first with CDs and a homespun tour of \u201cEdges,\u201d and more recently with producers, performers and journalists  \u2014   that has served them well. \u201cThey\u2019re salesmen, and always have been  \u2014   they know how to explain what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Mr. Blaemire said. Michael Gracey, the director of \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d had imagined asking a number of songwriters to contribute songs to his film, but, as he talked with Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul about the movie, abandoned that plan to give them all the work. He even videotaped their songwriting sessions, convinced that they would be of significance for posterity. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to describe the enormous impact those two have had on this film,\u201d he said. The director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle, had a similar experience: He was looking for seasoned lyricists who could write words for songs composed by Justin Hurwitz when Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul, seeking the gig, gave him proposed lyrics for a song called \u201cCity of Stars. \u201d That became a signature number. \u201cIt was screamingly obvious that we had stumbled onto a gold mine with these guys, and we brought them on right away,\u201d Mr. Chazelle said. Their promise was evident as soon as they started writing together. Brent Wagner, the emeritus chairman of the musical theater program at the University of Michigan, still remembers the night in 2005 when Mr. Blaemire, then a junior, persuaded him to stop by the Kerrytown Concert House in Ann Arbor to see \u201cEdges. \u201d \u201cIt was a youthful work, and it wasn\u2019t completely advanced  \u2014   there wasn\u2019t even music written down  \u2014   but it was marvelous, and at that moment, you knew you were in the midst of real talent and real understanding of theater craft,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cBy the time they left school,\u201d he said, \u201cwe knew it would just be a matter of time. \u201d Jeff Marx, the Tony     of \u201cAvenue Q,\u201d was equally convinced  \u2014   so sure that he placed a bet on them. A Michigan alumnus, he had taken on Mr. Pasek as an assistant in the summer of 2005. (\u201cI looked at his Friendster profile and he seemed like a nice kid. \u201d) The next year, when Mr. Pasek asked to return, Mr. Marx told him he needed to stop interning and focus on writing shows with Mr. Paul. Mr. Paul couldn\u2019t afford to write full time  \u2014   he needed to earn money for school  \u2014   but Mr. Marx was so intent that he offered to give Mr. Paul money in lieu of what he would have earned from a summer job. Then, when Mr. Paul said he was unwilling to accept charity, Mr. Marx repositioned his offer as a wager, staking him $7, 000, to be repaid only if Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul made it to Broadway within the next decade. It happened, but in an unexpected way. They had a frustrating experience adapting the Roald Dahl children\u2019s book \u201cJames and the Giant Peach,\u201d which was mounted at Goodspeed Musicals in 2010, and has been revised since. They remain proud of their songs, and the show is still being produced at small theaters, but the Dahl estate has decided to restrict professional productions to make room for a different adaptation. Their musical version of the 1991 film \u201cDogfight\u201d was presented at Second Stage, Off Broadway, in 2012, and was generally admired, but not well enough to make the leap to Broadway. But after the initial songwriter for the adaptation of the 1983 family film \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d was let go, they were brought in  \u2014   and nominated for a Tony Award  \u2014   when the show, which was developed to tour, ended up transferring to Broadway in 2012. Six years after Mr. Marx\u2019s bet, Mr. Paul handed him a check at the opening night party. \u201cMy money was safe,\u201d Mr. Marx said. Other mentors have stepped in, too. Stephen Schwartz, the writer of \u201cPippin\u201d and \u201cWicked,\u201d has been advising them since Mr. Paul met him as an undergraduate. Mr. Schwartz recommended them to Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty (\u201cRagtime\u201d) who admitted them to a Dramatists Guild fellowship. Ms. Ahrens and Mr. Flaherty assigned them to observe the development of \u201cNext to Normal,\u201d where they met the director Michael Greif (best known for \u201cRent\u201d) who is now directing \u201cDear Evan Hansen. \u201d The new show was borne from an observation Mr. Pasek had about how his own high school community reacted when a former student died unexpectedly he noted the desire of many, including himself, to be counted among the bereaved for someone they did not know well. Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul had talked about the idea for years when a producer, Stacey Mindich, who had helped commission \u201cDogfight,\u201d offered to finance their dream project. She introduced them to the work of a playwright, Steven Levenson, who became the \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d book writer, turning their musings into a narrative. The show, developed through   productions last year at Arena Stage in Washington and this year Off Broadway at Second Stage, features a   performance by the    Mr. Platt (\u201cPitch Perfect\u201d). As a high school student he had discovered Pasek and Paul via YouTube, and sang one of the \u201cEdges\u201d songs at a senior concert. (Mr. Platt is not the only Pasek and Paul fan in his family  \u2014   his father, Marc Platt, is the producer of \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cSnow White. \u201d) The duo\u2019s work demonstrates an understanding of the contemporary lives of teenagers, but several of their collaborators have also been struck by their empathy for parents. \u201cThe insight they seem to have into the heart of a   mother has been there as long as I\u2019ve known them,\u201d said Ms. Jones, who has played Pasek and Paul mothers in \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d and \u201cDear Evan Hansen. \u201d \u201cThey use these tiny moments to describe enormous feelings that have no words  \u2014   a lyric about a Ninja Turtle   or glow stars on the ceiling,\u201d she said, referring to a song that was used during the early stages of \u201cDear Evan Hansen. \u201d Both Ms. Jones and Mr. Platt distinctly remember the day Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul brought in a new song, \u201cSo   Small,\u201d in which her character describes the impact of the breakup of her marriage on his character\u2019s childhood. \u201cIt makes you die inside because it\u2019s so real,\u201d she said. Mr. Platt agreed. \u201cEverybody was a big wreck. \u201d As they now prepare for the openings of the musical and movie, Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul describe what looks like sudden success as largely a coincidence. They have been working on \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d for six years, they finished writing songs for \u201cTrolls\u201d and \u201cLa La Land\u201d more than a year ago, and they haven\u2019t yet begun work on \u201cSnow White. \u201d But still  \u2014   on one particularly busy recent day, they started in Dumbo, Brooklyn, at 8:30 a. m. for a \u201cGreatest Showman\u201d script meeting traveled to Midtown to tweak \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d arrangements with their orchestrator, Alex Lacamoire split up so Mr. Paul could go to a Chelsea studio to record tracks for \u201cShowman\u201d while Mr. Pasek sat in on auditions for Mr. Platt\u2019s understudy went to MoMA for a screening of \u201cLa La Land\u201d hosted by Jennifer Lawrence and then to an   at the Rainbow Room\u2019s Bar SixtyFive. Most days aren\u2019t nearly that varied or that glamorous. And at the start of each project, it is still the two of them, trying to figure out how to tell a story through music. \u201cNothing changes  \u2014   the next time we have to write a song we\u2019re going to sit down at a piano and bang our heads against it for a long time and talk ourselves blue in the face about what it should be,\u201d Mr. Paul said. Mr. Pasek jumped in, finishing the thought: \u201cFacing the blank page doesn\u2019t get any easier. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561657.7079012}
