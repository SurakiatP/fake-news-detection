Lucero led the way, holding the hem of her strapless ball gown in one hand and a matching bouquet of silk garden roses in the other. Her parents, Alberta and Abundio Cedillo, followed. From a distance, the chambelanes could have easily been mistaken for cadets at a police academy graduation, walking in sync wearing black suits with gold aiguillettes around their right shoulders, eyes hidden under peaked hats with gold insignia. The Rev. Silvio A. Ortiz began the quincea\u00f1era Roman Catholic Mass by congratulating Lucero, who knelt before him at the altar. He blessed several items, including a porcelain doll, a symbol of Lucero\u2019s childhood. Applause echoed through mostly empty pews. Then Lucero and her court scurried into the limo, heading for the party, a catered affair for 150 guests at a Greek Orthodox church hall in Bay Ridge. Widely celebrated among Latinos, the quincea\u00f1era marks an important milestone in a girl\u2019s life. Part birthday party, part rite of passage, it symbolizes a girl\u2019s entrance into womanhood when turning 15, traditionally showcasing her purity and readiness for marriage. But the quincea\u00f1era has also been Americanized. And the increasingly elaborate celebrations reflect the changing landscape of Latinos in the United States. In fact, Lucero\u2019s quincea\u00f1era was not, strictly speaking, a quincea\u00f1era at all. The celebration, held in February, had many of the traditional trappings: a Mass, a catered bash with live music, and a ceremony in which Lucero\u2019s transition to womanhood was marked by trading her flats for heels. But Lucero turned 15 a year ago this was an adapted Sweet 16. \u201cI wanted to switch it up,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cI wanted to keep some of my parents\u2019 traditions but celebrate at a different age. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s how it\u2019s done in the United States,\u201d she added. \u201cThe modern quincea\u00f1era has become the   manifestation of what it means to be visible in an American system on your own terms,\u201d said Rachel V.   a folklorist and professor in the Department of Mexican American    Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. At the same time, she added, the celebrations create \u201ca space that recalls your cultural heritage. \u201d Lucero initially felt reluctant to ask her parents for the party, calling it \u201ca big waste of money on just one day. \u201d Contemporary quincea\u00f1eras do tend to have a hefty price tag. Event planners, bakers and caterers, hair stylists, makeup artists and D. J. s have all become part of what will soon be a   industry, said Mar\u00eda Bejarano, director of Quincea\u00f1era Magazine, a trade publication. \u201cWhen you put the numbers together, it\u2019s stratospheric,\u201d Ms. Bejarano said. \u201cThe quincea\u00f1era business is a monster that keeps on growing. \u201d The celebration has spawned specialized retailers, fashion expos, even a reality show, \u201cQuiero Mis Quinces,\u201d promoting custom parties. Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen\u201d was among the most popular themes last year, according to quincea\u00f1era store owners. Many girls are incorporating decidedly secular and   elements. They choreograph their traditional dance routines to mainstream pop music instead of waltzes. Lucero opened the dance floor to a Beyonc\u00e9 mix. In 2013, Disney introduced a line of   quincea\u00f1era dresses, retailing for $300 to $900, and its theme parks offer catered events like the Belle of the Ball package, which starts at $20, 000. For an additional $2, 500, quincea\u00f1eras can make royal entrances in     carriages. In New York, a quincea\u00f1era celebration averages around $10, 000, according to Alfonso Caviedes, who owns Fantasy, a   dress shop in Jackson Heights, Queens. He offers a layaway system on dresses, which on average cost $600. \u201cSome families cannot afford to pay for the dresses up front,\u201d Mr. Caviedes said. Rosa Jimenez, who owns Bridal by Rosa\u2019s in East Harlem, puts the typical cost even higher. \u201cI would recommend that families set aside at least $15, 000,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a wedding. \u201d The median household income for Latinos in the United States in 2014 was just over $42, 000, according to the Census Bureau, and in New York City the figure is lower. But the high prices don\u2019t dissuade families from celebrating. Villa Russo, an event hall in Queens, charges up to $18, 700 a night for 275 guests. About 30 quincea\u00f1eras a year are held there. Families book custom bakers, like Iva Velazquez in Brooklyn. Ms. Velazquez supplies cakes for 15 quincea\u00f1eras a year her prices can quickly run into the thousands, depending on sugar flowers, ruffles and other intricate details. Some have come to resent such extravagance. \u201cNowadays, families are disrespectful to the church,\u201d said Ana Morales, quincea\u00f1era coordinator at St. Paul\u2019s Church in East Harlem. \u201cThey bring in these loud musicians, like mariachis, to the quincea\u00f1era. The parties in the pews are taking pictures they are on their cellphones. They seem to have forgotten why they are in church. \u201d As a result, St. Paul\u2019s has been less inclined to hold such Masses. \u201cThe quincea\u00f1era is a symbol of status and recognition,\u201d Ms. Bejarano, the magazine director, said. \u201cFamilies want to celebrate big. But it\u2019s these strong ties to tradition that distract parents from thinking about how they will pay for their daughters\u2019 future education. \u201d Professor   of the University of Texas, finds such criticism problematic. \u201cPeople don\u2019t tend to question lavish bat mitzvahs,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople make the assumptions that Jewish communities are more affluent, whereas Latino communities are stereotyped as impoverished. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like talking to someone who is on a diet and saying, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t really eat that,\u2019 and assuming that they don\u2019t know what they are putting in their mouth,\u201d she added. Lucero\u2019s parents, cooks by trade, had been saving for this day for two years. Now both 50 years old, they immigrated to the United States from Mexico in their early 20s. \u201cMy parents grew up poor,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cThey used to work in the fields. My mom, when she first got to the U. S. she used to work in factories. My mom never had a quince, so she told me, \u2018I didn\u2019t have a chance, but you do! \u2019\u201d \u201cOf course this is a sacrifice for us,\u201d Mr. Cedillo acknowledged. \u201cBut we don\u2019t see it that way. This is tradition. Lucero is a good daughter, and she deserves a party. \u201d The quincea\u00f1era appeals to both new immigrants and those established for several generations, Professor   said, but for different reasons. For newer arrivals, it\u2019s about \u201ccreating a display of affluence,\u201d she said. For   or   Latino Americans, the quincea\u00f1era has become a way to reclaim traditions with which they\u2019ve lost touch. Staging these elaborate celebrations requires a system of patronage, particularly in Mexican communities, in both Mexico and the United States. The girl\u2019s parents reach out to relatives and friends to help pay for everything from the limo to the beer. Lucero\u2019s godparents  \u2014   12 relatives and friends had been selected  \u2014   helped cover the celebration\u2019s cost: around $13, 000. At the church hall in Bay Ridge, Lucero walked slowly between two columns of chambelanes as they held their costume swords. When she arrived at a white throne, two of her godparents handed her a long, bedazzled scepter and placed a crystal tiara atop her carefully curled hair. Mr. Cedillo knelt before his daughter with a silk pillow holding sparkling silver shoes. Lucero lifted her ball gown just enough to let her feet emerge from the layers of fabric. He removed her flats, swapping them for the   heels. The moment, a traditional part of the quincea\u00f1era, is supposed to be the first time a young girl wears high heels and dances with a man. This was not quite the case with Lucero. \u201cI\u2019ve danced since I was 9,\u201d she said after the party. \u201cThis is definitely not the first time I\u2019ve put on heels. \u201d At nearly 1 a. m. the staff was clearing away empty plates. Lucero\u2019s parents called up the godparents and handed each a basket of fruit and blankets as thanks for their sponsorship and attendance. The family huddled to say a prayer. Then the lights dimmed and banda  \u2014   traditional   Mexican music  \u2014   blasted through the speakers. Lucero\u2019s father and uncle emerged from the kitchen, carrying a roasted pig on their shoulders. The guests had formed a running circle around the dance floor, and Lucero joined them after changing into a   cream dress. Soon she was dancing barefoot to her own manic adolescent rhythm, her sparkling high heels clutched tightly at her side.'"}, "time": 1742628401.5166054}
