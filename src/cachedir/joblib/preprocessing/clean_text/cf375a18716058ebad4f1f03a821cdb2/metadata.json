Right now they are in the grieving phase.\\nThis image captured by Daily Mail photographer Jae Donnelly tells it all \u2013 actually, there are many angles and snaps of this priceless moment at the Daily Mail :\\n\\nAccording to the Daily Mail :\\nHillary Clinton\u2019s closest aide Huma Abedin wept openly in the street on Friday as she returned to the place where the Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign was fought \u2013 and lost. \\nAbedin looked like she had the weight of the world on her shoulders as she visited the campaign headquarters of the failed presidential candidate \u2013 after her own stumbles and her husband\u2019s sexting habits helped contribute to Clinton\u2019s historic defeat.\\n[\u2026] The pain and emotion of the situation were clearly visible on the face of the long-time loyalist, despite the dark large-frame sunglasses that covered her eyes. \\nEvidently, her breakdown was triggered by a text message, as the Daily Mail notes:\\n\u201cAbedin appeared to start weeping after she read a message on her mobile phone as she made her way to the Brooklyn headquarters.\u201d \\nIt is thought that Huma feels guilty for the campaign\u2019s defeat, as the last minute FBI investigation into Hillary just before election week was largely due to the 650,000 emails found on her husband\u2019s laptop, himself under fresh investigation for allegedly misdeeds involving underage girls. Regardless of the merits of either of the investigations, it may have taken Hillary down a final peg, just enough for Donald Trump to win the presidency.\\nThough Huma is taking it quite hard, she is hardly the only one upset.\\nHillary Clinton herself has been reportedly crying inconsolably, and cycling through systematic blame against her surrogates and opponents, while lamenting her own loss of what is, no doubt, \u2018rightfully\u2019 hers.\\nAs SHTF reported, it was the primary reason why she did not make an appearance on election night:\\nAccording to Ed Klein who spoke with a close friend and confidante of Hillary, that she did, in fact, have a serious breakdown and was in no condition to speak to America on live television.\\nThe shock of losing after having been a \u201c98%\u201d lock for the Presidency was simply too much to bear. And as you might expect from a Clinton, it was everybody else\u2019s fault: \\nShe was crying inconsolably. She couldn\u2019t stop crying. And her friend, her female friend from way, way back said it was even hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard\u2026 her friend said she could make out that she was blaming James Comey, the Director of the FBI, for her loss, and, I don\u2019t understand exactly, the president of the United States for not doing enough. ( Via Gateway Pundit) \\nThe question is, did Hillary really cast the bulk of blame on the loyal aide who is typically more closely at her side than even her daughter or husband?\\nHillary has a notoriously dark reputation for (allegedly) throwing objects at the former president , castigating her staff and surrogates and demeaning the general public and even her own supporters .\\nWe can only imagine how bad she took her rage and despair about the big loss on Huma.\\nRead more: We Finally Know Why Hillary Disappeared On Election Night: \u201cShe Was Crying Inconsolably\u2026 It Was Hard To Understand What She Was Saying She Was Crying So Hard\u201d \u201cShe Was In Full Meltdown\u201d: Hillary Unleashed On Donna Brazile For Unapproved Debate Question \\nEvidence Surfaces That \u201cDNC Chair Fed Questions to Hillary Campaign in Advance\u201d \\nMake No Mistake: \u201cEveryone Who Is Warning About Clinton Is A Target and They Are Marked\u201d \\nMedia Faces Blowback From Clinton Worship: \u201cThey Bet the Farm on Hillary\u2026 And Lost\u201d \\n'"}, "time": 1742564172.0912423}
