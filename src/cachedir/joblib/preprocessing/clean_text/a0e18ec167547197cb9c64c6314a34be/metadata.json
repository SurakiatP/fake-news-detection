During that fateful assignation, Ms. Leggero was searching Mr. Kasher\u2019s car for a lost cigarette when she instead found a pair of women\u2019s underwear  \u2014   not hers. Mr. Kasher, who acknowledged that they belonged to a previous paramour, said that he could still remember his panicked reaction. \u201cAll of my focus was on going, like: \u2018What? I don\u2019t know what those are,\u2019\u201d he said over a recent dinner with Ms. Leggero here. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know what objects are. I don\u2019t know what fabric is. \u2019\u201d Ms. Leggero, who was not especially angry then or now, laughed at Mr. Kasher\u2019s recollection. \u201cThat\u2019s a good joke  \u2014   you should do that in your act,\u201d she said. Now married, Ms. Leggero, a saucy standup, actress and   of the Comedy Central historical satire \u201cAnother Period,\u201d and Mr. Kasher, a hyperverbal performer, podcaster and creative contributor to films like \u201cZoolander 2,\u201d have found further ways to strengthen their union. Though they had a proper honeymoon after their Oct. 11 nuptials, they have spent the past weeks on what they are calling their \u201cHoneymoon Tour. \u201d At these comedy shows in comfortable destinations, they perform their individual routines, then appear together. (The tour started on May 22 in Honolulu and continues through Monday in Los Angeles.) Yes, this tour, which offers the sufficiently rare sight of      on the same bill, allows them to earn money while vacationing at luxury resorts (like the San Ysidro Ranch, where they were now dining). It is also an opportunity for them to bond as a couple, and to stave off feelings of isolation that many comedians experience. \u201cIt is the ideal way to tour,\u201d Mr. Kasher said. \u201cExcept for having to split the money, this couldn\u2019t be better. \u201d Later that night, they performed at Velvet Jones, a Santa Barbara nightclub where Ms. Leggero joked about having never wanted to marry and having no desire to become pregnant. (\u201cYou have to stop drinking in public,\u201d she explained.) Mr. Kasher needled her for claiming that he had performed on HBO. (\u201cI\u2019ve never been on HBO,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my wife. \u201d) Over dinner, the two spoke with more tenderness for each other. Before they began dating, Ms. Leggero said, she was \u201ca serial monogamist\u201d Mr. Kasher said he was \u201cbusy, romantically\u201d (by which, he added, he meant \u201cvery promiscuous\u201d). But, from afar, they appreciated each other\u2019s work, and Mr. Kasher said he considered Ms. Leggero the type of friend \u201cthat you\u2019ll text every six months to remind them that you\u2019re around, if they\u2019re ever single. \u201d Chelsea Peretti, the \u201cBrooklyn  \u201d star and a longtime friend of the couple, said that they were compatible because they were both \u201cblunt hippies. \u201d \u201cThey have this weird common ground,\u201d Ms. Peretti said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey both have this spiritual side and this side that likes to be indulgent. Moshe does Burning Man, and Natasha will do spa baths that I don\u2019t venture into. But then they both can be cutting and outspoken. \u201d Despite the misgivings about marriage she joked about, Ms. Leggero said that when they were dating, she felt they were \u201con the marriage track. \u201d But Mr. Kasher, who has written in his memoir, \u201cKasher in the Rye,\u201d about growing up in Oakland, Calif. and Brooklyn as a child of divorced parents, said he had felt uncertain about the relationship models he\u2019d seen in his life. Ms. Leggero, who grew up in Rockford, Ill. was more guarded about her upbringing but agreed with Mr. Kasher\u2019s assessment that her parents were also volatile. (\u201cNext question,\u201d she said softly.) Mr. Kasher compared his hesitation to his fear, earlier in his career, of moving from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, where they now live. \u201cSomebody said to me, \u2018You know, you can just move back,\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cI was like: \u2018Huh. Yeah.\u2019 The same thing with marriage. Why not give it a whirl? And if you fail, you can just get a divorce. \u201d The wedding was a traditional Jewish ceremony  \u2014   Ms. Leggero converted from Roman Catholicism  \u2014   and took place at the couple\u2019s house in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. \u201cBecause we\u2019re comedians, we agreed: No bits at the wedding,\u201d Mr. Kasher said. But, Ms. Leggero added, \u201cHe let me have just one. \u201d After their vows, the couple momentarily disappeared, then reappeared to mock a   rite by holding up a sheet that said, \u201cShe\u2019s a virgin!\u201d Ms. Peretti, who married the comedian Jordan Peele (\u201cKey  Peele\u201d) this year, said Ms. Leggero and Mr. Kasher\u2019s ceremony was so enjoyable that it made her question her decision to elope with Mr. Peele. \u201cIt was bittersweet, going to a fun wedding,\u201d Ms. Peretti said. \u201cYou go, \u2018Ugh, are we missing out on family and friends?\u2019 And then ultimately, we decided, \u2018Nah. \u2019\u201d As professional partners, Ms. Leggero and Mr. Kasher said they did not compete over material or industry stature, though Mr. Kasher, who also works on \u201cAnother Period,\u201d said wryly that he can sometimes feel \u201ca power imbalance\u201d there. \u201cI make her scream \u2018executive producer\u2019 when we\u2019re making love,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a constant reassurance that I\u2019m valued and it wasn\u2019t nepotism. \u201d Though they could point to only a few examples of other comic spouses who have traveled and performed together  \u2014   vintage duos like Gracie Allen and George Burns or Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, or contemporaries like Bonnie McFarlane and Rich Vos  \u2014   they said their tour let them lean on each other in lonely moments on the road. Looking back on a New Year\u2019s Eve when he was performing solo in Grand Rapids, Mich. Mr. Kasher said: \u201cAt 12:05, I was in the lobby of a Courtyard Marriott with some Doritos and a Diet Coke, headed to my room to watch Netflix. It\u2019s nice to be on the road and do these shows. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so sad,\u201d Ms. Leggero said. If there is any downside to marital bliss, they say, it is the fear that happiness will take away the tension and the skepticism that shape their comedic perspectives. \u201cWhen you become happy, and your life is becoming more solid and stable, it is a little harder,\u201d Ms. Leggero said. \u201cI felt like I was much funnier when I had, like, $30 in my account. \u201d Of course, if they need to make their lives complicated again, they can have a baby. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely people in comedy that have had children for material,\u201d Mr. Kasher said. Her routine notwithstanding, Ms. Leggero said she was ready to embrace having a child, but added, \u201cI\u2019m not having it for material. \u201d Mr. Kasher replied, \u201cWe\u2019re naming it Material. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628374.2892914}
