Having crossed the boundary into the taboo realm of Jewish power, Spencer is now under vicious attack from not only the mainstream media, but from some segments of the \u201calternative media\u201d that are revealing themselves as nothing more that Zionist tools. \\nDr. Slattery joined the show and commented on the significance of someone with the visibility of Spencer, someone with the ability to stage a major conference, addressing the reality of Jewish power. \\nThis show will open your eyes to the amazing progress that we are making. Please share it widely. \\n\\nOur show is aired live at 11 am replayed at ET 4pm Eastern and 4am Eastern. Related Share:'"}, "time": 1742628538.9993482}
