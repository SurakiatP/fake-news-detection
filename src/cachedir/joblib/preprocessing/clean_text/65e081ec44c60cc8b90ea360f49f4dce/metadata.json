[\u201cThe Arizona Board of Education has voted to approve new education standards to replace the Common Core State Standards,\u201d Education Week reports,  \u201cBut the changes are minor rather than a   repudiation of the   effort to set standards for what students should know in   arts and mathematics. \u201d  The prominent change in the standards is the addition of cursive writing lessons through fifth grade, an element that Common Core does not provide. In addition, Arizona\u2019s standards will now require younger students to study the concepts of time and money, and to spell frequently used words. \u201cThese new standards represent the final step in the repeal and replacement of the common core in Arizona, and they reflect the thoughts and recommendations of thousands of Arizona citizens,\u201d said state schools superintendent Diane Douglas in a press release. \u201cThe federally mandated Common Core Standards were initially adopted by the SBE in 2010 without a thorough public review, which deeply frustrated many Arizonans,\u201d Douglas continued. \u201cThat lack of public input became an even larger concern as problems with the standards were identified, many of which were related to the resulting curricula. \u201d \u201cCommon Core has at last been eliminated,\u201d the superintendent said. \u201c[W]e now have excellent ELA and math standards developed by Arizonans for Arizona students. \u201d The \u201cCommon Core\u201d standards were previously rebranded as the Arizona College and Career Ready Standards by former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R). Douglas campaigned for her post in 2014, running on an   Core platform. In September, KJZZ in Arizona reported that Douglas endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election with the statement that Trump \u201cshares my belief that the federal government\u2019s role in education needs to be reduced rather than expanded. \u201d Dr. Sandra Stotsky, an author of the celebrated Massachusetts ELA standards, was asked to review the draft of the Arizona ELA standards, and shared her recommendations to Douglas and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) with Breitbart News. Stotsky expressed her disappointment: If it is not possible to find a group of Arizona newspaper editors to rewrite the poorly written English language arts standards, then I suggest that Superintendent Douglas and Governor Ducey   all the 2003 Arizona literature standards in place of those in this draft document. Overall, they were quite good. For example, in grade 11, students are to read \u201cworks of American literature that reflect our major literary periods and traditions. \u201d Stotsky also pointed out that a   Core Thomas B. Fordham Institute reviewer observed in 2010  \u2014   in a comparison of Arizona\u2019s prior standards with Common Core: \u201cArizona treats literary and   texts distinctly and thoroughly and in more detail than the Common Core. \u201d Writing at education blog \u201cTruth in American Education\u201d about the Arizona standards, Shane Vander Hart observed, \u201cThere has been some technical changes, but as far as I can see most of the foundational problems still exist. The early elementary standards are still  . There is still an over emphasis on informational text. The math standards still do not adequately prepare students for STEM programs in college. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Superintendent Diane Douglas, who campaigned on ending Common Core, put her stamp of approval on this process and these standards,\u201d he continued.  \u201cIt is also disconcerting that these standards were voted on instead of allowing an additional month of review and public comment. Arizona can do better than this. \u201d At Ricochet, Arizona high school parent Shawnna Bolick writes, \u201cIn a shocking irony, the very person  \u2014   Diane Douglas  \u2014   who promised to \u2018stop Common Core,\u2019 recommended the \u2018revised\u2019 standards standards virtually identical to the Common Core state standards foolishly adopted by the SBE in 2010. \u201d Bolick explains that Ducey directed the state board of education in 2015 to have \u201cteachers and parents to bring [standards] forward together,\u201d and, citing the fast adoption of Common Core in 2010, to \u201cmake right the situation  \u2026    with full transparency. \u201d She states, however, that, despite the formation of a standards development committee that included parent members, \u201cfor the past year and a half the standards were only being reviewed by \u2018technical professionals\u2019 and lobbyists in   meetings. \u201d \u201cThese individuals were largely   core individuals,\u201d Bolick continues. \u201cMultiple requests were submitted to the Arizona Department of Education to include parents or people with opposing viewpoints, but these were turned down each time. \u201d Bolick concludes that the state\u2019s \u2018bureaucratic tyrants\u201d have \u201c \u201d Arizona\u2019s standards. In a column at Breitbart News, Stotsky urged the elimination of state boards of education and departments of education, observing, \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clearer that the main groups oppressing parents, local school boards, and local teacher unions with Common   standards and tests (regardless of what they are actually called) are state boards of education and state departments of education. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561837.8498344}
