November 1, 2016 Raymond Ibrahim \\nNote: In what follows, Shillman Fellow Raymond Ibrahim reviews Force and Fanaticism: Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond, by Simon Ross Valentine. A shorter version of the book review first appeared in the Middle East Quarterly (Fall, 2016, vol. 23, no. 4). \\nValentine, a British Methodist pastor and teacher who taught in Saudi Arabia, has written a useful book about the desert kingdom. Most interesting is its exploration of how the monarchy is \"the single greatest force in spreading Islamic fundamentalism\"; it \"has spent as much as $100 billion to spread Wahhabism in the West,\" yet \"America and Britain have been, and are continuing to be, implicit supporters of Wahhabism.\" \\nValentine discusses the background of how this \"unholy alliance\" came about. He warns: \"If the West simply ignores it, Saudi Arabia\\'s role in international terrorism seems likely to worsen rather than conveniently disappear.\" This is troubling considering that \"ISIS is Saudi Arabia\\'s latest monstrous contribution to world history.\" \\nThe author explores important topics, including the mutawwa , or religious police, and provides useful historical context, discussing the origins of \u201cWahhabism,\u201d its alliance with the House of Saud, and the oil discoveries that changed everything. \\nThe book\u2019s primary defect is standard. Valentine regularly insists that \u201cit is of the greatest importance to distinguish between Wahhabism and Islam generally.\u201d Anything good, positive, tolerant and peaceful is ascribed to Islam; anything bad, negative, intolerant, and violent\u2014misogyny, draconian punishments, execution of apostates, intolerance for and discrimination against non-Muslims\u2014is ascribed to \u201cWahhabism.\u201d \\nThis position appears to be based on the author\u2019s own cultural presuppositions. Thus he \u201cfelt confused and puzzled\u201d to hear of Wahhabi intolerance, including the \u201cattempt to propagate their beliefs by force,\u201d prompting him to wonder: Can you force someone to love God?.... In all the conversations I had with ulema, imams, Mutawa [religious police] and Saudis generally there was never a mention of \u201clove,\u201d the idea that God loved me, just frightful talk of hell, burning and future pain if I did not believe and accept the Wahhabi faith.\u201d \\nHad Valentine engaged in a critical reading of Islamic doctrine and history\u2014as opposed to projecting his Christian notion of God onto Islam\u2014he would\u2019ve known that Muhammad, followed by countless caliphs and sultans throughout the centuries, did \u201cpropagate their beliefs by force\u201d (the overwhelming majority of today\u2019s Muslim world was taken from non-Muslims \u201cby force\u201d) and that although Islam attributes 99 characteristics to God, \u201clove\u201d is not one of them. \\nValentine\\'s readers would\u2019ve benefit much more had he simply laid out his useful information concerning the inner workings of the Saudi regime and its unholy alliance with the West, without trying to tackle the deeper question of what Islam really is\u2014leading to yet another book marred by Islamic apologetics.'"}, "time": 1742563256.7552528}
