According to a report in the New York CBS Local, \u201cdozens\u201d of invaders have been streaming through the streets of McAllen, Texas, on a daily basis. \u201cThey have been taken to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where they were released by Border Patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum,\u201d CBS said. Border patrol agent Chris Cabrera told CBS News that they\u2019ve been seeing a spike in immigrants crossing the U.S.\u2013Mexico border illegally, thanks in part to the election. \u201cThe smugglers are telling them if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that there\u2019ll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date,\u201d Cabrera said.'"}, "time": 1742628476.4098506}
