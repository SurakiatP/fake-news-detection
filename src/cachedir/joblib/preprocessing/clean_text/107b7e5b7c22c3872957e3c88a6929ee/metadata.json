All that work was to ensure her children\u2019s potential would be realized. Ms. Lewis raised them by herself after a divorce in 1984, motivated by her vow to keep them safe and pay for their college educations. \u201cThese children, I cannot lose them to drugs, I cannot lose them to crime,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd today, my children, all three of them, are successful. But their success, the way the world is, they cannot help me. \u201d Ms. Lewis left her security guard job in 2009, a year and a half after tests showed she had cancer in her left breast. The disease has returned four times since, most recently in August, despite repeated treatments of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to remove cancerous tissue. \u201cIt takes a whole lot of effort to psych yourself that you\u2019re not going to die,\u201d she said. Ms. Lewis must scrape together every dollar to cover medications, hospital bills and other expenses, including rent and groceries. She receives a combined $2, 089 a month from her Social Security and pension payments. \u201cI can\u2019t look to my kids to contribute and help me because they will go under,\u201d she said. They have homes, responsibilities and children of their own, she said. Ms. Lewis\u2019s two sons are police officers, one in Texas and the other in upstate New York. Her daughter is a teacher in New Jersey. Ms. Lewis tries to see them and her nine grandchildren whenever she can. \u201cI\u2019m fighting the cancer because it\u2019s fighting me,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I want to live. I worked so hard. I want to enjoy my grandkids. \u201d In 2011, Ms. Lewis contacted Community Health Advocates, a program run by the Community Service Society of New York, one of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It helped Ms. Lewis buy medication at a lower price. This year, she sought its help again. The Community Service Society used $1, 380 in Neediest funds to pay an outstanding medical bill and back rent, and to buy a special mattress that allows Ms. Lewis to elevate her legs and sleep more comfortably. The yearslong fight against cancer has taken a toll on her body, if not her spirit. Her grip is so feeble she requires a neighbor\u2019s help to open a can of tomato sauce. Part of a tooth broke off simply chewing a carrot. Even if the cancer goes away, she will need to wear a wig for the rest of her life because her hair has grown back in unsightly patches. \u201cYou never know how cold you are at night until you have no hair,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. When it came time to select a wig, she balked at fancier ones because she worried they would make her look like Tina Turner or the Lion King. \u201cI just want something where when my grandkids look at me, I\u2019m still grandma,\u201d she said. A desire for normalcy sealed her decision not to remove her left breast, especially after doctors told her the cancer could return anyway. She does not care what her reconstructed breast looks like now. \u201cIt looks distorted,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s mine. \u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a husband, but I like to go swimming with my kids and grandkids. I want to be normal, as normal as I can be. \u201d She has covered the walls of her Harlem apartment, which she calls a cage, with photographs of her grandchildren, as well as artwork they have made for her, turning the sterile, austere space into a shrine to her family. Doctors have told Ms. Lewis that after her current radiation treatment, which will run through December, her condition could stabilize for five years. She absorbed the news with skeptical optimism, aware that her health has fluctuated and that she is unlikely to keep living on her own. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll be in an assisted living home,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. She has already started looking at options. \u201cI\u2019ve made peace with myself with the way I\u2019m going. \u201d For now, Ms. Lewis, often tired and sick from treatments, leaves her apartment as often as she can. She visits her    mother once or twice a week, attends services at the Ephesus   Adventist Church in Harlem and is a regular at her neighborhood\u2019s senior center. \u201cI have my bad days,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cBut I have my good days, too. I look at my bad days, the good days overrule. If I stay in this bed, I will surely die. If I get out of this bed, I can make myself do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562221.0637312}
