[But the federal government has arrested and jailed at least 76 people since 2001 from the seven countries covered in the first stage of the president\u2019s reform, which was announced late January.  That fact means there is a huge error in the judge\u2019s rationale for imposing a \u201cTemporary Restraining Order\u201d ban on the president\u2019s popular reform of the expensive refugee and immigration programs. In a hearing before the decision, Judge James Robart told a lawyer from the Department of Justice that the federal government has not arrested people since 2001 from any of the seven countries named in the reform, since the 20o1 atrocity in New York. \u201cHow many arrests have there been of foreign nationals for those seven countries since  ?\u201d he asked. The justice department\u2019s lawyer replied, \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t have that information,\u201d prompting Robart to answer his own question: Let me tell, you, the answer to that is none, as best I can tell. You\u2019re here arguing on behalf of someone that says we have to protect the United States from these individuals coming from these countries and there\u2019s no support for that. But according to a database built by the Senate\u2019s immigration subcommittee, the federal government has arrested and convicted at least 73 people from the seven countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen. The Senate\u2019s database was assembled despite repeated refusals by Obama\u2019s deputies to provide   data to the Senate subcommittee in 2016. However, by reviewing public data, \u201cat least 380 of the 580 individuals convicted of terrorism or   offenses between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2014, were born abroad,\u201d the report concluded in June 2016. The committee\u2019s report also added: At least 380 of the 580 were   (71 were confirmed   and the remaining 129 are not known).  Of the 380   at least 24 were initially admitted to the United States as refugees, and at least 33 had overstayed their visas. Additionally, of those born abroad, at least 62 were from Pakistan, 28 were from Lebanon, 22 were Palestinian, 21 were from Somalia, 20 were from Yemen, 19 were from Iraq, 16 were from Jordan, 17 were from Egypt, and 10 were from Afghanistan. A check by Breitbart News shows that the people convicted include five Iranians, 19 Iraqis, two Libyans, 21 Somalians, six Syrians, three Sudanese and 20 Yemenis. That\u2019s a total of 76 people, at least. The committee\u2019s review of arrestees was overseen by Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions,   of the Senate immigration panel. Sessions is expected to become the nation\u2019s Attorney General, and will likely reverse the justice department\u2019s 2016 policy of hiding information about terrorists\u2019 immigration status from the public. A review of the Senate\u2019s data in 2016 by Breitbart News showed that at least 100 men named for Mohammed have been arrested and convicted for   crimes since 2001.  '"}, "time": 1742561726.591817}
