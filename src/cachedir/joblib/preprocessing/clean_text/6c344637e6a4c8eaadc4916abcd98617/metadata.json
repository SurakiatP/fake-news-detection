Streaking across the sky on Sunday night in his papal airliner, returning from a visit to Armenia, Francis also visibly winced, momentarily overcome with emotion, when a journalist, Cindy Wooden, mentioned the recent attack at an Orlando gay nightclub and noted that Christians are sometimes blamed for stigmatizing homosexuals. Francis did not directly address the Orlando killings. But he endorsed a comment of one of his top advisers who, soon after the Orlando attack, said that the church had marginalized gay people  and should apologize. The pope said the church \u201cmust\u201d not only apologize to a gay person it offended, \u201cbut we must apologize to the poor, to women who have been exploited, to children forced into labor. \u201d Marianne   executive director of DignityUSA, a leading organization of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics, said the pope\u2019s remarks represented a powerful statement, if not enough. \u201cFor a pope to acknowledge that the church has done so much damage to gay people, and that we deserve an apology, is an unprecedented act of humility,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut a statement of remorse is only as good as the change in behavior that follows. \u201d Francis\u2019s outreach toward gays has been part of his broader effort to welcome people who have felt marginalized by the church. He made global headlines early in his papacy when he signaled a new openness toward gays when he famously uttered, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d Francis\u2019 words raised hopes among some gay Catholics and others that he might make significant changes inside the church itself. Some advocates even wondered if he might loosen the church\u2019s prohibition of   marriage as part of his broader move to make the church more welcoming to unconventional families. But Francis has steadfastly opposed   marriage. His   document on family life, \u201cAmoris Laetitia,\u201d called on the church to welcome gay people but flatly closed the door on   marriage. \u201cHe\u2019s not liberal,\u201d said the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who is close to the pope. Instead, Father Spadaro said Francis sought to avoid categorizing people and wanted a welcoming environment devoid of discrimination. \u201cOf course,\u201d he added, \u201che wants a church of open doors. \u201d In a statement, Ryan Hoffman,   director of Call to Action, a Catholic group, praised Francis\u2019 remarks but also called on Catholic officials to \u201creform teachings and practices that refer to gay people as \u2018objectively disordered\u2019 and \u2018intrinsically evil.\u2019 \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time Francis\u2019 wise words translate into just action,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. Ms.   pointed to cases of the firing of gay employees of Catholic schools in the United States after they married in civil ceremonies. She also noted that bishops around the world often played leading roles in campaigns against gay rights. \u201cWe need the church to understand the reality of our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd where church teaching and practice has caused so much trouble. \u201d Popes have a tradition of apologizing for past sins of the church. In 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a sweeping apology for the church\u2019s errors over the previous 2, 000 years. Francis himself offered a striking apology during his 2015 trip to South America, when he asked for forgiveness for the church\u2019s complicity in the brutality of the era of Spanish colonialism. \u201cThere are a lot of people at the Vatican who don\u2019t like the church ever admitting we ever did anything wrong,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit priest and senior analyst for The National Catholic Reporter. \u201cWith gays, it is especially important because they are still subject to persecution and discrimination all over the world, and even in the United States. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561774.0995288}
