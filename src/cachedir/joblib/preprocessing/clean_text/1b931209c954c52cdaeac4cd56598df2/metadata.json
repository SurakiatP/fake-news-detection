The two quakes  \u2014   one measuring 5. 4, the other 5. 9, according to Italy\u2019s national volcanology center  \u2014   were two hours apart on Wednesday evening, and caused damage to a number of buildings in several central Italian towns. They were part of the same seismic activity that began with the Aug. 24 quake in the Apennine Mountains. The epicenters were in the province of Macerata, near the towns of Castelsantangelo sul Nera, Visso and Ussita, but the quakes were felt as far away as Veneto in the north, and even many Romans  \u2014   including employees of the Foreign Ministry, which was evacuated  \u2014   took to the streets after buildings began to tremble. The situation is \u201cnot so catastrophic\u201d as could have been expected after such a powerful quake, Fabrizio Curcio, the head of Italy\u2019s civil protection department, said at a news conference on Wednesday evening. He said several people had gone to hospital emergency rooms for light injuries and panic attacks. A third quake measuring 4. 6 struck shortly before midnight. \u201cYou can understand how these sequences can strain people,\u201d he said. Many people had decided not to spend the night in their homes, he said, so several towns had set up temporary lodgings. Officials said civil protection workers and firefighters, including teams trained to find people in rubble, were on site in the stricken towns to monitor developments. But steady rainfall and darkness made a thorough evaluation more difficult, Mr. Curcio said. \u201cWe\u2019ll know more as assistance to the areas continues,\u201d and with the approach of daylight, he added. On Wednesday night, many in the quake zones opted to forgo temporary lodgings and slept in their cars, Italian television reported. Geologists said shocks were to be expected after a strong earthquake like the one that struck in August, which effectively destroyed the town of Amatrice, in the Lazio region, as well as other towns in Umbria and the Marches region. On Wednesday night, at least 30 aftershocks  \u2014   including the two more powerful tremors  \u2014   were registered. Carlo Meletti, of the national volcanology center, noted that in past earthquake disasters aftershocks had continued for some six months. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say whether the sequence will continue like today, and whether it will extend to the north,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we can say is that it\u2019s part of the same system of faults that began on Aug. 24. \u201d The Apennines are situated in a highly seismic area, and after each quake, criticism over the failure to better protect buildings there has become a national refrain. Massimo Cialente, the mayor of L\u2019Aquila, the Abruzzo city that was destroyed in a 2009 earthquake, said residents there also felt Wednesday\u2019s quake, even though the epicenter was more than 60 miles away. \u201cIt shows we have to do more to secure the country, because we can\u2019t be terrorized every time there is an earthquake that hits 5. 0,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563612.9928975}
