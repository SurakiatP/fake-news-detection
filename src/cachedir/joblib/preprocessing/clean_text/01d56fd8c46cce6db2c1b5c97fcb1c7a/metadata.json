During the interview, Assange discussed the idea of \u201cfake news\u201d and how WikiLeaks\u2019 refusal to editorialize their content and rather provide pure data to the public has allowed them to publish facts without bias.  \u201cWhat is special about WikiLeaks is that it\u2019s not just another damn story,\u201d said Assange, \u201cit\u2019s not just another damn journalist putting their damn byline, advertising themselves and their position on another damn story. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not reading   knowledge,\u201d Assange said in discussing WikiLeaks vast database of information. \u201cWhen you read a newspaper article, you are reading weaponised text that is designed to affect a person just like you  \u2026     I think that is the real beauty of WikiLeaks  \u2026     it is that sea of information, that treasure, that intellectual treasure, that rebel library of Alexandria you can go into. \u201d Surprisingly, Assange said that he was quite happy to see the narrative of \u201cfake news\u201d being pushed by the media, claiming so far WikiLeaks has a 100% correct record when it comes to verifiable information. \u201cWhen the narrative of fake news came out and was then taken off effectively by the   press and pushed around  \u2026     I could see exactly where that was going. I was rather happy about it,\u201d Assange said. \u201cWikiLeaks is very happy that there is a narrative about fake news out there because we have a perfect record of having never got it wrong in terms of authentications. \u201d \u201cThe real value in WikiLeaks is it is a wonderful library that you can trust  \u2026     But the library has to be marketed. And so the   business, which we\u2019re also in  \u2014   I view that as a kind of marketing effort for what is much more substantial, which is our archive,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe try and maximize the value of the information to readers. So that\u2019s publishing it at the moment when they most want to read it, when they most want to know what it contains. And that\u2019s definitely before an election rather than after election. \u201d When asked about the accuracy of the released emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Assange said, \u201cWe had lots of critics in the Democratic Party, liars in the Democratic Party  \u2026     saying that what we published was not accurate  \u2014   trying to imitate it, sometimes saying it directly. And of course we could mathematically prove that they were liars. And it\u2019s not every day that you can mathematically prove that your critics are full of it. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
