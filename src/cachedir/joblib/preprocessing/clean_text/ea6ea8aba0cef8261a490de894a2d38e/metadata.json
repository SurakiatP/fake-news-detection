I will be visiting with the leaders in many different countries to strengthen our old friendships, build new partnerships, and unite the civilized world in a fight against terrorism. In that spirit of unity, I will travel to lands associated with three of the world\u2019s great religions. My first stop will be Saudi Arabia  \u2014   the heart of the Muslim World. There, I will address a historic gathering of the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations. I will represent the views of the American people frankly and clearly. Many of these leaders have expressed growing concern about terrorism, the spread of radicalization, and Iran\u2019s role in funding both. Now it appears Muslim leaders are ready to take more responsibility and a much bigger role in fighting terrorism in their region. It\u2019s about time we do it, we\u2019ll do it together, but it has to be done. America cannot solve all of the world\u2019s problems, but we can  \u2014   and we must  \u2014   help any nation willing to join in the common cause of eradicating terrorism from the face of the earth. Next, I\u2019ll travel to the ancient city of Jerusalem to talk with my good friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, about bringing peace and prosperity to both our nations. Israel is an important American ally, but in recent years we haven\u2019t always treated them that way. It\u2019s time to renew our friendship. While I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem to discuss ways to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians. From there, I\u2019ll head to the Vatican, where I will have the great honor of an audience with Pope Francis. I look forward to speaking with the Pope about how Christian teachings can help put the world on a path to justice, freedom, and peace. I will also meet with friends and allies in Europe at a gathering of NATO in Brussels and at the   Summit in Italy. Finally, I will close my trip by saying thank you to some of the courageous men and women of the United State Military serving their nation overseas. In my Inaugural Address, I pledged to strengthen America\u2019s oldest friendships, to seek new partners in pursuit of peace, and above all  \u2014   to always put American people first. I also pledged that our partners must show that they\u2019re partners, they must show that they\u2019re friends, and they must contribute financially to the tremendous cost  \u2014   the money that we\u2019re spending  \u2014   is so big it\u2019s so much and it\u2019s not fair for our nation.  They have to help and I\u2019m sure they will. The fact is that I\u2019m excited about new possibilities for peace and prosperity  \u2014   and I hope you are too. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561780.612284}
