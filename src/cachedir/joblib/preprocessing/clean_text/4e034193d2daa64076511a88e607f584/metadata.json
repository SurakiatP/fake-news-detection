In reply to Republican complaints earlier this month, Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cort\u00e9s acknowledged officials are preparing for all contingencies, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. \\n\\nBut George said the provisional ballot printing doesn\u2019t make sense even for contingencies. And it doesn\u2019t compare to demand in 2012. \\n\\n\u201cThe claim that it is for contingency planning is bogus,\u201d George said in an email. \u201cIn 2012, Stafford County used less than 500 provisional ballots \u2014 in 2016 they received 30,000. In 2012, Loudoun County used 700 provisional ballots. In 2016, they received 84,000. In 2012, Fairfax used 2,500 provisional ballots; in 2016, they received over 265,000. This is ridiculous.\u201d \\nBut spokeswoman Dena Potter of the Virginia Department of Elections said the state is trying to accommodate a court order. \\n\\n\u201cAs part of its emergency preparedness efforts and in response to the [December] 2015 consent decree related to mitigating long lines at the polls, the Department issued guidance to local registrars on August 29, 2016, that included having enough provisional ballot envelopes to equal at least 20 percent of the number of active voters as of September 1,\u201d Potter said in an email. \u201cAs of September 30, there were 5.5 million voters registered in Virginia. As with any contingency planning, we hope that we don\u2019t have to use these but they will be available in case we do.\u201d \\n\\nThe decision to print so many provisional ballots comes after an April announcement by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and a key ally of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. McAuliffe said he would allow more than 200,000 released felons to vote on Nov. 8. \\n\\nThe decision immediately brought a legal challenge from the Republicans, who won their suit in July. Virginia law says the governor must individually clear such cases, and cannot widely add so many released felons back to the voter rolls. \\n\\nGeorge believes the court loss is part of the thinking behind the surge in provisional ballots. The thousands of felons who signed up to vote after McAuliffe\u2019s order were initially welcomed to the voter rolls. George said left-wing voter groups were ready for the order, and signed up thousands of felons within hours. \\n\\nIf those felons now walk into a polling place and demand a ballot, they will be accommodated, George charged. George also said he is concerned other ineligible voters will be handed such provisional ballots simply if they demand them. \\nProvisional ballots are only counted by city and county election boards after Nov. 8, and Republicans should be prepared for things to go against them, George said. Each board has a Republican and a Democrat, and an McAuliffe appointee. \\n\\n\u201cGuess which way the vote is going to go,\u201d said George. \\n\\nVirginia leaders have been dealing with election headaches for months. On Oct. 13, Virginia legislators questioned Cortes at a hearing. One Republican leader, citing election problems, called for Cort\u00e9s to resign, according to the Times-Dispatch. \\n\\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent upon the governor to replace you quickly with competent and nonpartisan leadership,\u201d said Delegate Timothy Hugo, R-Fairfax.'"}, "time": 1742628476.515932}
