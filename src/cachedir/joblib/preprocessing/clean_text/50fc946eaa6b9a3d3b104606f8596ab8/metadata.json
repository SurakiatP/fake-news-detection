Perspective is still in early days of development, but in the future, you may have to adjust your speech in order to satisfy the lofty standards of Google. Otherwise, the company\u2019s faceless AI might just have to \u201cimprove\u201d you. Where\u2019s Sarah Connor when you need her? The good news is that, for now at least, Perspective is about as effective as   with a lisp. Software engineer and columnist David Auerbach has found the program woefully inept at sorting \u201ctoxic\u201d comments from ordinary ones. Because the AI currently focuses on words rather than meanings, inoffensive comments like, \u201cRape is a horrible crime,\u201d or, \u201cfew Muslims are a terrorist threat,\u201d were assigned \u201ctoxicity\u201d ratings of over 75 percent. Of course, even if Perspective could successfully sort \u201ctoxic\u201d comments from innocuous ones, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re going to be deleted or buried. According to the project\u2019s homepage, the system performs no function other than detection. But statements from the project\u2019s developers make it clear that censorship is the end goal. Indeed, the system seems to have been developed to augment the left\u2019s ongoing war on comments sections. The software was initially made available just to organizations that are part of Google\u2019s Digital News Initiative, including the BBC, The Financial Times, and The Guardian, which promptly began testing the software to moderate their comments sections. \u201cNews organizations want to encourage engagement and discussion around their content, but find that sorting through millions of comments to find those that are trolling or abusive takes a lot of money, labour and time,\u201d says Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, the Google social incubator that built the tool. \u201cAs a result, many sites have shut down comments altogether. But they tell us that isn\u2019t the solution they want. \u201d Google couldn\u2019t be clearer: it\u2019s a censorship bot. And just because it\u2019s currently limited to news sites and comments sections doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be rolled out to social networks and the rest of the web. Twitter, which just introduced yet another system to punish users who hurt celebrities\u2019 feelings, would probably love to get their hands on a working version of Perspective. Twitter already has a tremendous depth of data on its users, including gender, location, and personal interests. Imagine that data, combined with an AI tool designed to pinpoint inconvenient content, in the hands of a CEO who has done little to conceal his political biases. The idea of an   Google robot watching over us all, making sure our speech is \u201cimproved,\u201d has greatly excited mainstream media. Google, says the BBC, is going to \u201cmake talk less toxic. \u201d According to WIRED, Perspective will put a stop to \u201cabusive comments that silence vulnerable voices. \u201d New York magazine portrays Perspsective as a friendly a robot, \u201ca kind of Clippy for the comments section. \u201d Our robot overlords are certainly getting a warm welcome, The left are likely to be disappointed though. If Auerbach\u2019s early research on Perspective is any guide, the system is designed to filter out impoliteness, not political disagreement. Google\u2019s censorbot might turn the comments section  \u2014   and perhaps the web  \u2014   into a grey, sanitized dystopia scrubbed of strong emotions and trollish humor, but it won\u2019t get rid of facts. In other words, myths about gender wage gaps, police racism, and \u201cmoderate\u201d Islam are still going to get debunked. Even Skynet can\u2019t keep some things quiet.
