They are making the claim that Trump wasn\u2019t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it\u2019s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there\u2019s proof. \\nThe American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked \u201cHow likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.\u201d Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It\u2019s VERY unlikely that whites aren\u2019t getting jobs because minorities are, but that\u2019s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it\u2019s \u201cextremely likely\u201d that minorities are taking jobs from white people.

Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump\u2019s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. \\nPost election, this is what the study found: \\nThe question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d that whites can\u2019t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is \u201cnot at all\u201d likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don\u2019t think that. \\nMore than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are \u201cviolent.\u201d 84 percent think that of Muslims. \\nUnfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: \\nDemocrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I\u2019ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. \\nGreat idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots\u2019 claims go unchallenged. \\nFeatured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images Share this Article!
