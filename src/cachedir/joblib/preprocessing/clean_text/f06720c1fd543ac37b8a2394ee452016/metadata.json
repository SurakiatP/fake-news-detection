Alexis welcomes comments, letters, and queries in order to advance, explain, and expound rational and logical discussion on issues such as the Israel/Palestine conflict, the history of Christianity, and the history of ideas. In the interest of maintaining a civil forum, Alexis asks that all queries be appropriately respectful and maintain a level of civility. As the saying goes, \u201ciron sharpens iron,\u201d and the best way to sharpen one\u2019s mind is through constructive criticism, good and bad. However, Alexis has no patience with name-calling and ad hominem attack. He has deliberately ignored many queries and irrational individuals in the past for this specific reason\u2014and he will continue to abide by this policy. By Jonas E. Alexis on November 4, 2016 \"Over the last decade, the NSA has significantly increased the surveillance assistance it provides to its Israeli counterpart, the Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU; also known as Unit 8200), including data used to monitor and target Palestinians.\" \u2026by Jonas E. Alexis \\n\\nMy dear friend Mark Dankof has recently sent me an article which documents that a 17-year-old Israeli firm named Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization has been working with the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and DHS\u2019s Customs and Border Protection since 2009. There is more: \\n\u201cU.S. state and local law enforcement agencies use Cellebrite\u2019s researchers and tools as well, as does the U.S. military, to extract data from phones seized from suspected terrorists and others in battle zones. \\n\u201cIn July, months after the unknown third party provided the FBI with a method for getting into the San Bernardino phone \u2014 an iPhone 5C running iOS 9 \u2014 Cellebrite announced that it had developed its own technique for bypassing the phone\u2019s password/encryption lock. And the company is confident that it will be able to deal successfully with future security changes Apple may make to its phones in the wake of the San Bernardino case\u2026 \\n\u201cData extracted from phones has eclipsed data extracted from desktop and laptop computers in recent years, since the former can yield not only detailed logs about a user\u2019s activities, interests, and communications, but also, in many cases, map the user\u2019s whereabouts over weeks and months to produce a pattern of life.\u201d [1] \\nBloomberg itself confirmed that Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization has indeed been working with the FBI. [2] CNN calls Cellebrite \u201cthe mysterious \u2018outside party\u2019\u2026\u201d [3] \\nThis shouldn\u2019t be a surprise at all, for we know that the NSA and the Israelis are almost two sides of the same coin. The New York Times itself agrees with the prevailing view that \u201cthe N.S.A. was routinely passing along the private communications of Americans to a large and very secretive Israeli military organization known as Unit 8200.\u201d [4] One can reasonably say that Israel has a way in which the NSA is loused up: \u201cOver the last decade, the NSA has significantly increased the surveillance assistance it provides to its Israeli counterpart, the Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU; also known as Unit 8200), including data used to monitor and target Palestinians. In many cases, the NSA and ISNU work cooperatively with the British and Canadian spy agencies, the GCHQ and CSEC. The relationship has, on at least one occasion, entailed the covert payment of a large amount of cash to Israeli operatives.\u201d [5] \\nSolomon Ehrmann, a Viennese Jew, would have been pleased with what Israel has been doing. In a speech delivered at the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith in 1902, Ehrmann envisioned a future in which \u201call of mankind will have been jewified and joined in union with the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith.\u201d When that happens, \u201cnot only the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith but all of Judaism will have fulfilled its task.\u201d [6] \\nBaruch Levy, one of Karl Marx\u2019s correspondents, would have agreed. He declared: \u201cThe Jewish people taken collectively shall be its own Messias\u2026In this new organization of humanity, the sons of Israel now scattered over the whole surface of the globe\u2026shall everywhere become the ruling element without opposition\u2026. \u201cThe governments of the nations forming the Universal or World-Republic shall all thus pass, without any effort, into Jewish hands thanks to the victory of the proletariat\u2026Thus shall the promise of the Talmud be fulfilled, that, when the Messianic epoch shall have arrived, the Jews will control the wealth of all the nations of the earth.\u201d [7] \\nWell, Judaism is seeking to fulfill \u201cits task\u201d through the state of Israel, which we all know by now is based on the Talmud. [8] But Solomon, Levy, and others could not understand that no force is strong enough to impede the triumph of Logos in history. Julian the Apostate tried but failed miserably. Voltaire, Helvitius, d\u2019Holbach, D\u2019Alembert, Lametrie, Diderot, and nearly all the leading lights of the French Revolution tried. Not a single one of them succeeded because they were essentially fighting against the moral and political order, which is based on reason. \\nIf Hegel is right, that reason will triumph in the end, then Solomon, Levy and their minions cannot win. Their evil work is actually drawing them closer and closer to destruction. These people will continue to fail because they are blind to higher realities. They cannot not see that ultimate reason is the beginning and end of human history. They should have at least read Hegel\u2019s position on the philosophy of history. \\nWorld history, Hegel tells us, \u201cis governed by an ultimate design\u2026whose rationality is not that of a particular subject, but a divine and absolute reason,\u201d [9] and sometimes this divine and absolute reason has a cunning way of working itself out in history, irrespective of what evil men intend to do. This \u201cdivine and absolute reason,\u201d says Hegel will \u201crealize its end\u201d in due time. [10] \\nThe carnal man simply cannot understand this \u201ccunning of reason\u201d because he is again blind to higher metaphysics. Higher realities goes back to Heraclitus, Plato and Aristotle and was refined by people like Aquinas. It states that there is a mathematical, philosophical, moral, and political order in the universe and it is bigger than human beings. \\nHeraclitus wrote: \u201cListening not to me but to the Logos\u2026\u201d [11] According to scholar Eva Brann, Heraclitus \u201cdirects us not to intellectual self-reliance, not to seek some truth, but to comprehend and follow this truth: that said b the Logos.\u201d [12] This Logos, according to Heraclitus, is both \u201ca maxim and Wisdom Inarnate.\u201d According to Brann\u2019s interpretation of Heraclitus, \u201cThis great Logos has a wisdom, or rather it is the Wise thing, and this Wise Thing has a maxim, or rather it is that practical principle which guides everything through everything, relates all things to all things\u2026\u201d [13] \\nWhat Heraclitus and others of that era were trying to establish is that there is an order in this universe, which is undeniable. There is a mathematical, philosophical, esthetic, political and moral order. Any deviation from that order has serious consequences, including intellectual death. And anyone who studies the universe from a rational and truthful standpoint can recognize that order. \\nEven physicists and mathematicians like P. C. W. Davis, Sir Fred Hoyle, John D. Barrow, Frank J. Tipler, Sir Martin Rees, among others, have come to realized that the mathematical order in the universe demands an explanation. [14] That explanation cannot be attributed to chance at all. [15] \\nRees himself argues that there are basically six numbers that sustain the physical properties of the entire universe. If you change any one of those six numbers (such as the strong nuclear force, gravitational force, etc.) \u201ceven to the tiniest degree, there would be no stars, no complex elements, no life.\u201d Rees adds, \u201cHad these numbers not been \u2018well tuned,\u2019 the gradual unfolding of layer upon layer of complexity would have been quenched.\u201d [16] \\nWell, these numbers are \u201cwell tuned\u201d because they were based on what the Greeks and St. John call the Logos, which the carnal mind ultimately rejects. This \u201cabsolute reason,\u201d says Hegel, will bring about the end of history. \\nBut looking at all the evil and chaos in this world, obviously the carnal man would think that there cannot be an \u201cinfinite power, which realizes its ends.\u201d But Hegel would respond by saying that this is why this \u201cinfinite power\u201d is \u201ccunning\u201d and is more powerful than human beings. \\nThis \u201cinfinite power,\u201d according to scholar Robert C. Tucker\u2019s interpretation of Hegel, \u201cfulfill its ulterior rational designs in an indirect and sly manner. It does so by calling into play the irrational element in human nature, the passions.\u201d [17] \\nThe carnal mind simply lacks vision and insight to understand all this because he limits himself only to the primitive idea that the material universe, as Karl Sagan hubristically propounded, \u201cis all that is or was or ever will be.\u201d [18] \\nThe carnal mind cannot see that the materialist position lacks intellectual rigor to explain simple things like love, hate, justice, truth, hatred, etc. The best that the carnal mind can offer here is to posit that those things are simply illusions. As Nobel Laureate Francis Crick put it years ago in his book The Astonishing Hypothesis : \u201cThe Astonishing Hypothesis is that \u2018You,\u2019 your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.\u201d [19] \\nRichard Dawkins makes the same assumption when he argues that the universe is \u201cjust electrons and selfish genes,\u201d therefore \u201cmeaningless tragedies\u2026are exactly what we should expect, along with equally meaningless good fortune.\u201d [20] \\nThe word \u201cmeaningless\u201d itself implicitly assumes something called \u201cmeaningful.\u201d And both words again assume that there is a \u201claw\u201d by which to differentiate what is \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201cmeaningless.\u201d And a law assumes a \u201clawgiver.\u201d That\u2019s what the carnal mind like Dawkins is promiscuously trying to deny! Perhaps people like Dawkins need to think goodness that they have never met people like Kant. \\n[1] Kim Zetter, \u201cWhen the FBI Has a Phone It Can\u2019t Crack, It Calls These Israeli Crackers,\u201d The Intercept , November 1, 2016. \\n[2] Yaacov Benmeleh, \u201cFBI Worked With Israel\u2019s Cellebrite to Crack iPhone,\u201d Bloomberg , March 30, 2016. \\n[3] Jose Pagliery, \u201cCellebrite is the FBI\u2019s go-to phone hacker,\u201d CNN , April 1, 2016. \\n[4] See James Bamford, \u201cIsrael\u2019s N.S.A.
