The Virgin Mary, Francis said, \u201cencourages us with her faith,\u201d when she acknowledged that the \u201cMighty One has done great things for me. \u201d She also \u201cknew how to give thanks to God who looked upon her littleness,\u201d he said, and \u201crecognised the great things that God was accomplishing in her life. \u201d Importantly, the Pope noted, Mary did not sit by idly but \u201cset off to visit her cousin Elizabeth who was old and needed her to be close by. \u201d \u201cMary did not stay at home because she was not a young couch potato who looks for comfort and safety where nobody can bother them,\u201d Francis said. \u201cShe was moved by faith because faith is at the heart of Our Mother\u2019s entire life story. \u201d In his message, the Pope told young people that God is watching over and calling them, looking at all the love they are able to offer. \u201cLike the young woman of Nazareth,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can improve the world and leave an imprint that makes a mark on history \u2014  your history and that of many others. \u201d \u201cThe Church and society need you,\u201d he added. \u201cWith your plans and with your courage, with your dreams and ideals, walls of stagnation fall and roads open up that lead us to a better, fairer, less cruel and more humane world. \u201d The Pope also encouraged young people to cultivate a relationship of familiarity and friendship with Mary as \u201cour Mother,\u201d urging them to speak to her \u201cas you would to a Mother. \u201d \u201cTogether with her,\u201d he said, \u201cgive thanks for the precious gift of faith that you have received from your elders, and entrust your whole life to her. She is a good Mother who listens to you and embraces you, who loves you and walks together with you. \u201d \u201cI assure you that if you do that, you will not regret it,\u201d he said.
