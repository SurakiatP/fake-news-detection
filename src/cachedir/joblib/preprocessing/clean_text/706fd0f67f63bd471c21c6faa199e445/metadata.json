It is insane,\u201d he told the student paper. \u201cThe crazier and crazier that this left gets .\\u2009.\\u2009. the more the alt-right is going to be laughing their asses off [and] getting more pissed.\u201d, he was quoted as saying. \\n{snip} \\nBut Rectenwald says he began getting \u201cdirty looks\u201d in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group, including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. \\n\u201cAs long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,\u201d they wrote of the untenured assistant professor. \\n\u201cWe seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the \u2018destruction of academic integrity\u2019 Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program\u2019s approach to global studies,\u201d they argued. Rectenwald likened the attack to \u201ca Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large,\u201d said the professor, a popular instructor who was graded 4.4 out of 5 on ratemyprofessors.com . \\nThe same day the letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. \\n\u201cThey claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health. They suggested my voicing these opinions was a cry for help,\u201d Rectenwald told The Post. \u201cThen they said I should leave and get help.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nStudents told him that professors openly discussed with students how he may be fired. \\nThe leave has \u201cabsolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,\u201d said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel. \\nBut Rectenwald is disheartened. \\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid my academic career is over,\u201d he said Rectenwald. \u201cAcademic freedom: It\u2019s great, as long as you don\u2019t use it.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628479.616221}
