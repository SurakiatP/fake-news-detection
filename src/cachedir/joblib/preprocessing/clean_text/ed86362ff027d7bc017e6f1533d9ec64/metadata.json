Is it on my wall?\u201d he said, imagining Mrs. Clinton trying to use the popular social media site. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary. \u201d Mr. Obama also needled Mrs. Clinton for paid speeches she gave for Goldman Sachs. He noted that if his comedy routine, during his final appearance at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, was successful, he could earn \u201cserious Tubmans\u201d  \u2014   a nod to Harriet Tubman, the American abolitionist whose image will be printed on future $20 bills. He referred to Senator Bernie Sanders, who was in the audience, as \u201ccomrade,\u201d a reference to his political status as a democratic socialist. But the president reserved his most biting commentary for the Republicans running for president, repeatedly turning to the party\u2019s chaotic nominating contest for comedic fodder. Mr. Obama mocked Senator Ted Cruz for calling a basketball hoop a \u201cbasketball ring\u201d while campaigning in Indiana. \u201cWhat else is in his lexicon?\u201d Mr. Obama asked, working hard to contain a broad smile. \u201cBaseball sticks? Football hats?\u201d He paused, then added: \u201cBut sure, I\u2019m the foreign one. \u201d The president showed a picture of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio eating pancakes as he noted that \u201csome candidates aren\u2019t polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. \u201d And he tweaked Republicans in the audience for their search for an alternative candidate, noting that the options for dinner were steak or fish. \u201cA whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may not like steak or fish. But that\u2019s your choice. \u201d And then there was Donald Trump. Mr. Obama riffed at length about Mr. Trump, the     who was not in attendance. The president wondered aloud why Mr. Trump had chosen not to be there. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he said no,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIs this dinner too tacky for the Donald?\u201d He joked that Mr. Trump had some foreign policy experience because \u201che has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. \u201d And he noted that Mr. Trump may be the best person to succeed in closing the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. \u201cTrump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The president delivered his remarks with deft comic timing in a lengthy monologue that was both ironic and introspective. Members of the news media did not escape the president\u2019s acerbic sense of humor. He joked that the movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d about The Boston Globe\u2019s investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests and holding the powerful accountable, was \u201cthe best fantasy film since \u2018Star Wars. \u2019\u201d And he tweaked the news media for giving Mr. Trump \u201cthe appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. \u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s most personal jab at a journalist was aimed at Jake Tapper, the host of \u201cThe Lede\u201d on CNN. He noted that several journalists had left the White House beat in recent years, and then added: \u201cJake Tapper left journalism to join CNN,\u201d prompting Mr. Tapper to raise a wine glass. As has been his habit, Mr. Obama made fun of himself. He joked about his age  \u2014   and the common maladies that afflict men over 50  \u2014   suggesting that he felt far older than he did when he became president. \u201cHillary once questioned whether I\u2019d be ready for a 3 a. m. phone call,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNow I\u2019m awake anyway because I\u2019ve got to go to the bathroom. \u201d He also noted that he had spent two days in London recently having lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, playing golf with Prime Minister David Cameron, and seeing a Shakespeare performance at the Globe Theater. \u201cJust in case anyone is debating whether I\u2019m black enough, that should settle the debate,\u201d he said. Perhaps the most surprising moment of the president\u2019s appearance came in a video produced by the White House showing Mr. Obama considering how to spend his time after leaving office. In the video, Mr. Obama first turns to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for advice. But then the president decides to call someone else for help  \u2014   former House Speaker John A. Boehner, a Republican who was once a fierce adversary. The video shows the president and Mr. Boehner sitting in the White House movie theater watching the ending of \u201cToy Story. \u201d Mr. Boehner notes that he finally got the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d that had eluded the two leaders during budget talks. \u201cOn a sweet Chevy Tahoe,\u201d Mr. Boehner says, pulling out a pack of cigarettes and offering one to Mr. Obama, who has spent his presidency chewing nicotine gum to try to kick his smoking habit. The president\u2019s eyes go wide. Mr. Obama closed his appearance on a serious note, saluting Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter who had been held in an Iranian prison, and who attended the dinner Saturday night. He promised that his administration would \u201ccontinue to fight\u201d for journalists held against their will. And he praised the Washington press corps for trying to resist the commercial pressures to dumb down journalism, saying that \u201cthere are so many of you who are pushing against those trends. \u201d He then offered just two words: \u201cObama out. \u201d He dropped his microphone, and turned from the podium.'"}, "time": 1742628598.0983846}
