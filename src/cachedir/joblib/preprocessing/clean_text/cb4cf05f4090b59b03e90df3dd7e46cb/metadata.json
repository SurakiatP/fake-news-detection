November 07, 2016 ormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a news conference at the United Nations in New York in this March 10, 2015 file photo. \\nBefore WikiLeaks Podesta emails were released, Wall street investment analyst Charles Ortel called the Clinton Foundation \u201cthe largest unprosecuted charity fraud ever attempted\u201d \\nThe Wall Street investment analyst, has been looking into the Clinton Foundation since the spring of 2015. Ortel explains why he believes the Clinton Foundation is a \u201ccrooked charity cooking the books\u201d with over $2 billion dollars in revenue, in an exclusive video interview for The Daily Caller News Foundation. \\nThe Clintons, according to Ortel, have figured out how to turn their public service into a business. This charity is \u201ca perfect gathering place and a front\u201d to act as if you are helping others, when in fact they bring powerful people together, concocting deals and making people rich, including the Clinton's, Ortel says. \\nOrtel\u2019s charges raise the specter that the IRS and other government agencies are picking winners and losers for charities now with two sets of rules. Tea party groups, as well as Democrat Congresswoman Corrine Brown, who is facing over 300 years in prison for her $800,000 slush fund, faced the wrath of government, while the $2 billion Clinton charity that bends rules, goes without scrutiny, he says. Ortel gave a candid evaluation of the Democratic candidate, he said the Clinton's are not \u201cworthy to clean the brass on the White House doorknobs\u201d let alone be the leader of the free world.  \""}, "time": 1742563072.179072}
