Even as he played, he could see troops fighting in the distance and hear gunfire ringing out in the civil wars that raged through his childhood. He practiced every day, dreaming of playing in professional European soccer leagues. He had never seen a soccer game on television  \u2014   played on pristine fields with roaring fans  \u2014   but at 11, he left his family for Abidjan, the country\u2019s largest city, to play for a local team for the next three years. He also joined the Ivory Coast national team and traveled to Ghana, where the team made the semifinals in a tournament of African nations. In 2010, he got a chance to play in Italy for the AC Milan Football Academy Camp, a youth program sponsored by the elite Italian football league. But when a relative in Milan was unable to house him, he decided to pursue his dream in the United States. Then 15, Mr. Diallo boarded a plane with a friend of his brother\u2019s and headed to New York. They settled in the Bronx, but when his companion returned to Africa a month later, Mr. Diallo found himself alone on the streets. A practicing Muslim, Mr. Diallo found refuge at the Musa Mosque Islamic Center in the Bronx, where he often slept in the prayer hall. He also informally played soccer with the Fordham University team. \u201cHe\u2019d have played me, but I didn\u2019t have a diploma,\u201d Mr. Diallo said of the coach, recalling an interaction on the field. \u201cHe said, \u2018Where do you come from?\u2019 And I said, \u2018You don\u2019t want to know. \u2019\u201d Then a friend at the university invited him to play in pickup games at Heritage Field, the site of the original Yankee Stadium. That is where Mr. Diallo met Fernando Rodriguez, a   high school basketball coach battling advanced melanoma, who watched the games. Mr. Rodriguez approached Mr. Diallo after a game to compliment his performance. Mr. Diallo spoke little English, but he recognized Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s accent and responded in Spanish  \u2014   the language he had chosen to learn at the soccer academy in Ivory Coast. \u201cSo from then, we started talking,\u201d Mr. Diallo said with a smile. \u201cIt was a good moment. As time went by, he asked me about my life. I don\u2019t like talking about my problems the past is in the past. But he\u2019d take me to eat at a nearby cafeteria, and he\u2019d ask small questions. He asked where I lived, and I said, \u2018No house for me,\u2019 and he invited me to stay with him. \u201d A month after their initial meeting, Mr. Diallo accepted an invitation for a   dinner and saw Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s spare room. \u201cThere was no way I\u2019d find something better than that,\u201d he recalled thinking. Mr. Diallo, then 17, moved in and enrolled at Urban Assembly Media High School in Manhattan, starting as a 10th grader. He took classes to learn English and joined the soccer team, which won the championship in his first year. Mr. Rodriguez became Mr. Diallo\u2019s legal guardian and started filling out paperwork to adopt him. But his health continued to decline, and a year after taking in Mr. Diallo, he was admitted to a hospital. This time, it was Mr. Diallo\u2019s turn to take care of the man who had taken him in. He took warm meals to him and visited him often, updating him on his success at school. Mr. Rodriguez still managed to sponsor Mr. Diallo for his green card and help him apply for legal immigration status. Four months after Mr. Rodriguez died, Mr. Diallo learned that his immigration application had been approved. \u201cWhen he passed away, it was hard,\u201d Mr. Diallo said, shaking his head. \u201cHe\u2019d become my father. \u201d He played a game the day of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s funeral. And he continued classes. \u201cI had to stay in school,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give up on something he\u2019d helped me work toward. \u201d On a cold November morning, Mr. Diallo sat inside Create Young Adult Residences, a transitional housing program serving men 18 to 25, where he has lived since February 2015. Create is affiliated with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Mr. Diallo, now 20, recalls with pride the life he has lived after his mentor\u2019s death. He graduated from high school in June and was accepted to both the College of Staten Island and LaGuardia Community College. It is a far different future from the one he imagined in Ivory Coast, where he spent few years getting a formal education schools were often closed during the wars. He received a $2, 000 scholarship from the National Association for Education and Homeless Children and Youth. The New York Public Library awarded him a laptop for academic excellence, and Catholic Charities used $350 from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to pay for his schoolbooks. Financial aid will cover his academic costs for the first two years at both schools. It will not cover his room and board, but he qualifies for an $800 rental subsidy from the city. In addition to working part time as a waiter, bringing in about $600 a month, he plays midfielder for Boca Juniors   affiliated with Argentina\u2019s premier student soccer league. He travels to Long Island three days a week to practice, and has had tryouts with professional soccer clubs across the country, including the San Francisco Deltas and LA Galaxy II. Additional tryouts are scheduled for FC Miami City and Orlando City Soccer Club in January. He has also been invited for a return tryout in Los Angeles later in January but is unable to afford the plane fare. He laughed and shook his head, reflecting on the future, hopeful yet unwilling to wish too much. \u201cIf God gets me on a team  \u2014   whatever team  \u2014   this year, and I do well . ..,\u201d he said, his words trailing off. \u201cWith agents watching those games, you never know. \u201d He is waiting to choose a college until he hears back from professional soccer teams, and plans to start classes after tryouts conclude in February, studying business accounting or physical therapy. If he makes a team this year, he said, he plans to continue school in that city. Regardless of where the next few months take him, Mr. Diallo said, he will keep working to become a professional soccer player. \u201cI could do without anything  \u2014   live on the street  \u2014   to play soccer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve done that. I\u2019ve been dreaming about this day since I was born. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628319.4751096}
