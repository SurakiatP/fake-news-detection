Salesforce. com, the enterprise software maker that had been the most likely bidder for the embattled social media company, has declined to pursue a takeover. \u201cIn this case we\u2019ve walked away,\u201d Marc Benioff, Salesforce\u2019s chief executive, told The Financial Times in an interview published on Friday. As Salesforce exits, virtually no other suitors seem likely to emerge. Rumors of potential other bidders  \u2014   Google, Disney and Apple were among the names floated  \u2014   quickly evaporated. That leaves Twitter largely on its own, at least in the near term. And the move will please Salesforce investors, many of whom detested the idea of a pricey and distracting bid for the social network. Shares of Twitter, which had stabilized on the hopes that Salesforce might still make a bid, dropped about 5 percent in afternoon trading on Friday, to $16. 88. And shares of Salesforce rose about 5 percent, to $74. 27. Mr. Benioff confirmed his remarks but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Twitter, Kristin Binns, declined to comment. The interview all but confirms that Twitter will need to pursue a   plan rather than looking to a new owner that could shield it from the skepticism of stock market investors. Despite its prominence as a forum for public discussion  \u2014   especially during the presidential race  \u2014   Twitter has still lost ground to competitors old and new. Some Twitter users have been leaving the service, and the company has found it difficult to persuade people to join. Its advertising revenue growth is also on a path toward slowing down. Twitter has been emphasizing its mission around live events and   commentary, stressing initiatives based on   video, like its broadcasts of some N. F. L. games. Twitter executives and the board have tried to buy more time to show that they can refocus the company on those live events and increase its appeal. During the weeks when rumors of a Twitter deal reached fever pitch, speculation swirled around potential divides within the company\u2019s board. Among those who opposed a sale, at least at first, was Jack Dorsey, its   and chief executive. More recently, Mr. Dorsey had become increasingly open to selling the company. Without a deal, Mr. Dorsey and his team are more likely to face tough questions when earnings are reported on Oct. 27. Twitter executives have considered selling some units or laying off employees, as The New York Times reported last month. It could sell Vine, the mobile   service, or MoPub, a mobile advertising business. The investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen  Company are advising it on its options. \u201cThere is declining advertising interest in Twitter,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cWhen you overlay that with the company\u2019s current fundamentals, you\u2019ll see very little top line revenue growth next year. \u201d At the same time, companies mooted as potential buyers had decided that Twitter at its current valuation  \u2014   its market capitalization has surpassed $13 billion at certain points  \u2014   was too expensive and required too much work to fix. Salesforce\u2019s investors are probably feeling some relief. For much of its   existence, Salesforce has relied on acquisitions to grow, augmenting its core   management offerings. But 2016 has proved a particularly active time for   at the company. Salesforce has bought 13 companies for more than $4. 4 billion. Shareholders were upset that in August, Mr. Benioff agreed to pay $582 million for a company called Quip, a maker of   collaboration software that had negligible revenue. But Mr. Benioff said he needed its founders to rebuild his corporate architecture for the next new things in corporate software. A bid for Twitter  \u2014   a   company with significant challenges  \u2014   represented to many investors an act of overweening ambition. At a $12 billion market cap, Twitter would have been the largest deal yet for Salesforce, which is worth $50 billion. It was Salesforce\u2019s initial takeover approach that set off the flurry of speculation about a takeover, and as recently as early as this month, Mr. Benioff telegraphed his interest in buying what he called \u201can unpolished jewel. \u201d In an interview during his annual customer conference this month, he said he was attracted to Twitter as a way for companies to field customer complaints and promote themselves, and pursued the deal in part to learn more about the current tech market. Some of that may have been bluster. Mr. Benioff has often treated his company a bit like a   both in his generous stock grants to employees and his    . Yet many large Salesforce shareholders, including the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, sent emails and other messages to Salesforce executives voicing their displeasure. The prospect of a shareholder revolt could have proved disastrous for the company, which relies heavily on its stock for its   and to pay its employees. A sustained drop in Salesforce\u2019s stock price would harm both activities. In a meeting with analysts last week, Mr. Benioff sounded unusually contrite and somewhat shocked that his impetuous style had riled his biggest shareholders. \u201cWe will think through everything, but we would never do a deal that would ever do the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at that meeting. By Friday, Mr. Benioff conceded that Twitter was a deal he could afford to pass up. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right fit for us for many different reasons,\u201d he said in the Financial Times interview.'"}, "time": 1742628317.4585056}
