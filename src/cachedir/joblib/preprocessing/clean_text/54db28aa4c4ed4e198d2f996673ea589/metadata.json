She continued:\\nAnd she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in Syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against Russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. Like it or not, Russia has the sanction of international law to be there. For us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia. Both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. This is the most dangerous moment\u00e2\u20ac\u201d according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.\\nStein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stein said, adding:\\nNot only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record \u00e2\u20ac\u015a of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calling for a no-fly zone in Syria, which means we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets elected\u00e2\u20ac\u201cdeclaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having Hillary in White House. In some ways, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re arguably even more immediate and intense,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stein said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the world\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthis movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very clear what kind of a trend we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stein explained:\\nThis is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. \u00e2\u20ac\u015a There is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must find and elect alternatives to the Wall Street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stein wrote on Twitter.\\nStein, who has previously described Clinton as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Queen of corruption,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d attacked Clinton for her questionable ties to Qatar and Saudi Arabia:\\nDuring her interview with Stein, Fox Business host Kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smother\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authentic\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interesting\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d candidacy.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u201d they were so obsessed with Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u20ac\u201d and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Kennedy said.\\nStein agreed and said that the corporate media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speaks volumes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d She said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. \u00e2\u20ac\u015a Every day, there are more revelations how both \u00e2\u20ac\u015a [Trump and Clinton] are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d She added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The corporate media, the apologists for the Democrats and Republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throwing them under the bus.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742564319.6040854}
