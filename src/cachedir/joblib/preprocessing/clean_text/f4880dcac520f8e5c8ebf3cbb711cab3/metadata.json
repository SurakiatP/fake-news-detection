[\u201cI was alone with the president of the United States, or the   soon to be president,\u201d Comey said when asked why he documented his meetings with Trump. \u201cThe subject matter   \u2026     I was talking about matters that touch on the FBI\u2019s core responsibility and it related to the   personally and then the nature of the person, I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I thought it [was] important to document   \u2026     that combination of things. \u201d  Comey also said that he did not feel the need to document his conversations about intelligence with former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \u201cAs I said in my written testimony as FBI director, I interacted with President Obama and spoke only twice in three years and didn\u2019t document it,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWhen I was deputy attorney general I had one    meeting with President Bush about a national security matter. \u201cI didn\u2019t document that conversation either,\u201d Comey said.'"}, "time": 1742562005.3769085}
