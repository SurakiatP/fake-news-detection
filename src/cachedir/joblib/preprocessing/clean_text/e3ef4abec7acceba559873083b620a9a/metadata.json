Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. \\nIt doesn\u2019t help that white voters can\u2019t agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they\u2019ll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. \\nThe sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats\u2013the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. \\nThe people who will be worse off are everybody else\u2013the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. \\nLook to Mexico for your future\u2013or any Third World country. Or to Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) \\nExplaining Latino culture\u2019s acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that \u201cthe male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. . . . Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.\u201d \\nOne American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an \u201copen mind\u201d about child rape because \u201cit\u2019s a cultural thing.\u201d \\n{snip} \\n, our media already have a totally \u201copen mind\u201d about incest and child rape\u2013and murder!\u2013when it\u2019s committed by immigrants. \\n{snip} \\nImmigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too\u2013provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. \\n{snip} \\nPerhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. \\nManifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans\u2013or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. {snip} \\nOur country will be Zimbabwe, but\u2013if all goes according to the Democrats\u2019 plan\u2013they\u2019ll get to be Mugabe! \\nThat\u2019s Hillary\u2019s dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran\u2019s parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: \u201cWomen and Minorities Hit Hardest.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562300.4564223}
