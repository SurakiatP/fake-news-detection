Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions,\u201d said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. \\nDirector Comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with Department of Justic e accusing him of violating the Hatch Act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election. \\nThe Comey letter couldn\u2019t have gone much worse for Republicans. What the GOP originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a Republican scandal that Democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the Senate majority . \\nThanks to Chaffetz, House Republicans have already their credibility for future Clinton investigations, a s the Utah Republican\u2019s spin of Comey\u2019s letter was debunked in a matter of hours. \\nIt\u2019s all gone wrong in short order for Republicans. Comey and Chaffetz are facing complaints, and Hillary Clinton remains on course to be elected the next President Of The United States.'"}, "time": 1742564615.4897997}
