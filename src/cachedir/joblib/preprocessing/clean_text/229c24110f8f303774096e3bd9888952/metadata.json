I\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction.\u201d\\nThe President-elect\u2019s comments about mass deportations stand at odds with a statement made by Paul Ryan, the highest ranking Republican, on Sunday morning. \u201cWe are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump\u2019s not planning on that,\u201d Mr Ryan told CNN. \u201cI think we should put people\u2019s minds at ease: That is not what our focus is. That is not what we\u2019re focused on. We\u2019re focused on securing the border,\u201d he added. \u201cWe think that\u2019s first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue, we\u2019ve got to know who\u2019s coming and going into the country \u2013 we\u2019ve got to secure the border.\u201d\\nMr Ryan\u2019s remarks seemed to indicate yet another U-turn in policy proposals for the President-elect. On Friday, he told the Wall Street Journal that he would more than likely keep some parts of the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as \u201cObamacare\u201d, rather than completely repealing it.\\n\u201cEither Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\u201d Mr Trump told the newspaper following his 90-minute meeting with President Barack Obama. \u201cI told him I will look at his suggestions and, out of respect, I will do that.\u201d While Mr Obama said he felt \u201cencouraged\u201d by the Thursday meeting, a signifcant number of Americans believe Mr Trump\u2019s election will mark a dark, new phase for the United States, as he intends to dismantle much of the sitting President\u2019s legacy.\\nMillions of protesters took to the streets after election night to protest over Mr Trump\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton. While the New York businessman did win enough electoral votes to make it to the White House, Ms Clinton took the popular vote \u2013 more than any US president in history, with the exception of Mr Obama.\\nProtests filled roads in major cities, like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, and echoed with chants of \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cdump Trump\u201d. Dissenters are using the protests to rebuke the racism and bigotry promoted by the Trump campaign, as manifested through policy proposals like building a wall along the border, mass deportations, and the blockade of Muslim immigrants.\\nMr Trump\u2019s victory has galvanised white supremacists across the country, as a wave of reported hate crimesreaches new highs. Neo-Nazi and Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin exalted Mr Trump as a \u201cGod Emperor\u201d following Tuesday night\u2019s election results.\\n\u201cOur Glorious Leader has ascended to God Emperor. Make no mistake about it: we did this. If it were not for us, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[T]he White race is back in the game. And if we\u2019re playing, no one can beat us. The winning is not going to stop.\u201d The Ku Klux Klan also announced a victory parade for the beginning of December in North Carolina.\\nCivil rights organisations are preparing themselves for the incoming Trump administration. The American Civil Liberties Union published a full-page ad in the New York Times with an open letter threatening to sue Mr Trump. \u201cif you do not reverse course and endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality,\u201d the ACLU wrote, \u201cyou will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at your every step.\u201d\\nSource : (Independent UK) \\n'"}, "time": 1742628535.9424617}
