[Delta Air Lines and Bank of America have pulled their sponsorship of the Public\u2019s version of the play, but in a statement Monday the theater said it stands behind the production. It noted its staging has \u201cprovoked heated discussion\u201d but \u201csuch discussion is exactly the goal of our   theater this discourse is the basis of a healthy democracy. \u201d  Other defenders included Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, who wrote letters to the heads of Delta and Bank of America, arguing that dropping their support \u201csends the wrong message. \u201d He writes: \u201cArt matters. The First Amendment matters. Expression matters. \u201d He enclosed copies of the play with the letters. \u201cI hope you enjoy it  \u2014   it is a classic, in any age,\u201d he wrote. This   Caesar\u2019s violent death at the hands of conspirators comes not long after comedian Kathy Griffin was widely condemned for posing for a photograph in which she gripped a bloodied rendering of Trump\u2019s head. Though the Public\u2019s version of William Shakespeare\u2019s classic play is unchanged from its    original, the production portrays Caesar with a gold bathtub and a pouty Slavic wife. Trump\u2019s name is never mentioned, but backlash was swift. On Sunday, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a Fox News story about the play and wrote, \u201cI wonder how much of this \u2018art\u2019 is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does \u2018art\u2019 become political speech  does that change things?\u201d Delta responded by saying \u201cartistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. \u201d Bank of America said the Public chose to present the play \u201cto provoke and offend\u201d without the bank\u2019s knowledge: \u201cHad this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it. \u201d \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d ends its run Sunday. The comedy \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d begins in the park on July 11. The National Endowment for the Arts, which Trump, a Republican, once proposed eliminating, said that while the Public\u2019s Shakespeare programing has received its grants in the past none was awarded for \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d or for funds supporting the New York State Council on the Arts\u2019 grant for the Public. Theater lovers were quick to point out that a national tour of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d in 2012 by The Acting Company featured a Caesar played by a black actor in a modern business suit who had a resemblance to   Barack Obama, a Democrat. Sponsors of the Guthrie Theater, including Delta, apparently had no objections when that show landed in Minneapolis. The Public has long protected its role as incubator of provocative and challenging works, unafraid to mount plays that comment on current events or update Shakespearian plays to explore modern themes. It\u2019s had Trump in its sights before. It\u2019s the institution that birthed the megahit \u201cHamilton,\u201d whose cast members last year implored Vice   Mike Pence to support diversity, and where Meryl Streep donned   and a fat suit last summer to impersonate Trump at a gala fundraiser. Laurence Maslon, an administrator and arts professor at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, said it was disingenuous for large corporations that have backed the Public for years and enjoyed   its downtown cool vibe to sound alarmed now. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know what you\u2019re getting into,\u201d he said, adding that the Public has \u201c50 years of the most provocative, politically engaged work. \u201d He backed the \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d director, Oskar Eustis, saying he\u2019s \u201cnothing if not brave. \u201d The Public produced \u201cEmbedded,\u201d Tim Robbins\u2019   2003 riff on the events leading to the war in Iraq that had actors portraying hawkish presidential advisers wearing masks with grotesque facial expressions. In 2006, Eustis dedicated the summer season in Central Park to three works that focused on foreign affairs  \u2014   \u201cStuff Happens,\u201d in which David Hare looked at the debates in Washington in the   to the Iraq war, a militaristic production of \u201cMacbeth\u201d set in the early 20th century and a \u201cMother Courage\u201d with a new translation by Tony Kushner that had references to tax exemptions for the rich. Maslon said he thinks any loss of funding the Public experiences from corporate defectors will be compensated for by donations from liberal   groups and people worried about the apparent threat to artistic freedom. \u201cI can imagine any sense that this political regime is imposing a kind of censorship and the free market can help correct it will probably be good for the Public,\u201d he said. The Public isn\u2019t the only theater project trying to address the advent of Trump. On Broadway, Jon Jon Briones, who plays the sleazy Engineer in a revival of \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d makes a sarcastic reference to the Trump campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again. \u201d The recent   play \u201cBuilding the Wall,\u201d by playwright Robert Schenkkan, imagined the country under Trump\u2019s campaign promise to detain immigrants living in the country illegally. And filmmaker and activist Michael Moore is bringing a   show taking on Trump to Broadway this summer.'"}, "time": 1742561930.972387}
