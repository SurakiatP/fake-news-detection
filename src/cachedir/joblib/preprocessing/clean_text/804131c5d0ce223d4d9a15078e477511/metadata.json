Gatter is introduced to the buyers by Dr. Deborah Nucatola, PPFA\u2019s Senior Director of Medical Services, who also appeared in a CMP undercover video eating lunch and drinking wine, as she allegedly discussed how to harvest fetal organs and body parts so as to maximize their transfer to biomedical researchers. In the current video, Gatter is introduced as the Medical Director of Planned Parenthood\u2019s Pasadena, California, affiliate, and haggles with the undercover journalists over the price \u201cper specimen\u201d of fetal body parts. The undercover CMP journalist also discusses how the biomedical buyer will come into the Planned Parenthood clinic to handle the transfer of the fetal specimen. \u201cWe may have to make sure that your staff who are on site are credentialed, privileges, whatever, background checks and all that stuff,\u201d Gatter says on the video, adding: \u201cYou know, you have to pay a little money for the use of the space. \u201d They then discuss the issue of \u201ccompensation,\u201d with the undercover journalists suggesting \u201cper specimen\u201d payment and Gatter asking, \u201cPer specimen? Like $75 a specimen?\u201d When the journalist says, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been quoting is $50 per specimen,\u201d Gatter counters that \u201c$50 is on the low end. $50 was like 12 years ago. \u201d The undercover journalist explains that they like to pay \u201cper specimen\u201d because \u201cthat way we\u2019re not paying for material we can\u2019t use. \u201d \u201cBut you would show up to do this?\u201d Gatter asks. \u201cYou would send somebody?\u201d The undercover journalist agrees, \u201cOh exactly, we would send a tech. Yeah, we would send a tech in. \u201d After mentioning a \u201clovely tech\u201d named Heather from the biomedical firm Novogenix who worked at the Planned Parenthood Los Angeles clinic, Gatter eventually ends the conversation by saying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019d be willing  \u2014   give me a call. \u201d Earlier in the video, Gatter asks, \u201cWhat kind of volume do you need, and what gestational ages?\u201d The undercover journalist answers that \u201cmost of the requests are 16 weeks and above. \u201d Federal law permits reimbursement for specified costs in a fetal organ or tissue donation, but prohibits the purchase and sale of the organs and tissues themselves (42 U. S. C.  ). \u201cThe fact that [biomedical companies] Novogenix, StemExpress, and Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) stationed their own workers inside Planned Parenthood abortion clinics to perform the harvesting, packaging, and transport of aborted baby body parts demonstrates that Planned Parenthood had no reimbursable costs under the law,\u201d says CMP project lead David Daleiden. \u201cThe   sums that Planned Parenthood charged these businesses for baby parts are criminal trafficking and profiteering in fetal body parts. \u201d Gatter was previously the medical director of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, before taking the same position at the chain\u2019s Pasadena affiliate. Later, she was elected president of PPFA\u2019s Medical Directors\u2019 Council. While still at her post in the Los Angeles affiliate, Gatter oversaw its partnership with Novogenix Laboratories, LLC, a local   fetal organ and tissue harvesting company. \u201cI did it in LA, I\u2019m committed to it, I think it\u2019s a great idea,\u201d says Gatter to the undercover journalists posing as the buyers. The final report of the House Select Panel on Infant Lives addresses the pricing of fetal tissue: On April 20, 2016, the Panel held a hearing on The Pricing of Fetal Tissue. During the hearing, the Panel examined documents revealing that abortion clinics and Tissue Procurement Businesses (TPBs) may have violated federal law by the payments they collected from the sale of fetal tissue. At the core of the Panel\u2019s investigation is a federal statute, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7   which prohibits the transfer of any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. The statute states that reasonable costs include transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage \u2014  none of which it appears the abortion clinics did. Documents also show that payments made by the customer to the procurement business appear to exceed the costs incurred on the procurement business by a factor of 300 to 400 percent. As CMP notes, contracts and invoices show that biomedical companies Novogenix, StemExpress, and ABR \u201call made monthly payments to Planned Parenthood based on the number of resalable fetal specimens the wholesalers\u2019 workers could harvest inside the abortion clinics. \u201d \u201cPlanned Parenthood told Congressional investigators it kept no contemporaneous records of actual costs for reimbursement under the law,\u201d adds CMP, continuing: The Novogenix contract promises Planned Parenthood Los Angeles $45 \u201cper donated specimen. \u201d Planned Parenthood Los Angeles does over 15, 000 abortions every year, but has never publicly admitted how much money they received total under their contract with Novogenix. In December 2016, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Select Investigative Panel both referred Planned Parenthood Los Angeles and Novogenix to the FBI and U. S. Department of Justice for further investigation and criminal prosecution. \u201cThe U. S. Department of Justice should take heed of the congressional investigations\u2019 criminal referrals and prosecute Planned Parenthood to the full extent of the law,\u201d urges Daleiden, \u201cand taxpayers must stop being forced to subsidize Planned Parenthood\u2019s criminal abortion empire. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562901.2606878}
