Trump on Tuesday appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures. Repeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally here that it would be \u201ca horrible day\u201d if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people  \u2014   maybe there is, I don\u2019t know. \u201d Oblique as it was, Mr. Trump\u2019s remark quickly elicited a wave of condemnation from Democrats, gun control advocates and others, who accused him of suggesting violence against Mrs. Clinton or liberal jurists. Bernice A. King, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called Mr. Trump\u2019s words \u201cdistasteful, disturbing, dangerous. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, expressed disbelief. \u201cNobody who is seeking a leadership position, especially the presidency, the leadership of the country, should do anything to countenance violence, and that\u2019s what he was saying,\u201d Mr. Kaine said in Austin, Tex. He called Mr. Trump\u2019s remark \u201ca window into the soul of a person who is just temperamentally not suited to the task. \u201d And Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Trump\u2019s statement was \u201crepulsive  \u2014   literally using the Second Amendment as cover to encourage people to kill someone with whom they disagree. \u201d \u201cFor Trump, violence has become a standard talking point, a common punch line, and even a campaign strategy,\u201d Mr. Gross said. Paul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker who has had a tense relationship with Mr. Trump, told reporters on Tuesday night that the remarks sounded \u201clike a joke gone bad. \u201d He added: \u201cYou should never joke about that. I hope he clears it up quickly. \u201d Mr. Trump and his campaign did not treat his remark as a joke instead, they insisted he was merely urging gun rights supporters to vote as a bloc against Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThe Second Amendment people have tremendous power because they are so united,\u201d he told a CBS affiliate in North Carolina late Tuesday. In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump grew adamant. \u201cThere can be no other interpretation,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI mean, give me a break. \u201d But at his rally earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had actually been discussing what could happen once Mrs. Clinton was president, not before the election. And even many in the audience seemed caught by surprise. Video showed a man just over Mr. Trump\u2019s shoulder go   and turn to his companion, apparently in disbelief, when Mr. Trump made the remark. The uproar over Mr. Trump\u2019s    remark came as his campaign has been faced with a series of public opinion surveys showing him quickly losing ground to Mrs. Clinton, and just a day after his campaign called his delivery of a prepared economic speech in Detroit, evidence of a newfound political discipline. Mr. Trump\u2019s fellow opponents of gun control stood by him, focusing on his depiction of Mrs. Clinton as a threat to the Second Amendment. \u201cDonald Trump is absolutely correct,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, a strategist for the National Rifle Association. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton is elected, there is nothing we can do to stop her from nominating an   Supreme Court justice who will vote to overturn the individual right of   citizens to own a gun in their home for protection. \u201d The association also began running a new commercial characterizing Mrs. Clinton as \u201cone of the wealthiest women in politics\u201d and calling her a hypocrite for favoring gun restrictions while having been \u201cprotected by armed guards for 30 years. \u201d Her gun policies, the ad says, would leave ordinary people \u201cdefenseless. \u201d Veiled references to gun violence have tripped up candidates before. In 2010, Sharron Angle, a Nevada Republican challenging the Senate majority leader at the time, Harry Reid, severely damaged her unsuccessful candidacy while discussing the importance of the Second Amendment. \u201cWhen you read that Constitution and the founding fathers, they intended this to stop tyranny,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s to defend ourselves. And you know, I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems. \u201d Mrs. Clinton herself learned the hard way: In June 2008, shortly before she conceded defeat in her Democratic primary contest with Barack Obama, she defended her perseverance in a way that critics said alluded to the possibility that Mr. Obama could be gunned down. \u201cWe all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. She apologized hours later. Mr. Trump did not repeat his violent insinuation at a later event in Fayetteville, N. C. But Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who has championed gun control since the Sandy Hook mass shooting in his state, called Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdisgusting and embarrassing and sad. \u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t play,\u201d Mr. Murphy wrote. \u201cUnstable people with powerful guns and an unhinged hatred for Hillary are listening to you, @realDonaldTrump. \u201d The condemnation from Mr. Trump\u2019s critics across the political spectrum was deep. On Twitter, the conservative writer John Podhoretz, in a series of posts, wrote that Mr. Trump had implied that all Second Amendment supporters were \u201cpotential assassins. \u201d He added that a president\u2019s words \u201cCANNOT MEAN NOTHING. They are the most important words spoken in the world. \u201d And Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, wrote on Twitter that the Secret Service should investigate Mr. Trump for making a death threat against Mrs. Clinton: \u201cDonald Trump suggested someone kill Sec. Clinton. We must take people at their word. \u201d A Secret Service spokesman, who refused to identify himself, said that the agency was \u201caware of the comments\u201d but did not elaborate. Others seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s remark as an occasion for mockery. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump \u201cmakes death threats because he\u2019s a pathetic coward who can\u2019t handle the fact that he\u2019s losing to a girl. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign events have grown increasingly vitriolic, with angry chants and jeers directed at Mrs. Clinton. People at his rallies have, with greater frequency, loudly called for violence against Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   catcalls that Mr. Trump has generally let pass. And on Saturday, Mr. Trump praised his New Hampshire state   State Representative Al Baldasaro, who said recently that Mrs. Clinton deserved to face a firing squad over the F. B. I. \u2019s investigation of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In Wilmington on Tuesday, chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d which first gained traction during the Republican National Convention, were loud and frequent before Mr. Trump took the stage. But one speaker, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, tried to tamp those down. \u201cNo, no, we\u2019re here to beat her, and keep her out of Washington,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. He was interrupted by the same chant minutes later.'"}, "time": 1742562117.0700202}
