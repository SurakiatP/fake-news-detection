He was 84. His daughter Erika Schickel said the cause was complications of dementia. Fortified by boxes of Good  Plenty licorice rather than popcorn, Mr. Schickel reviewed films for Life magazine from 1965 until it closed in 1972, then wrote for Time until 2010 and later for the blog Truthdig. com. In a career that spanned the   studio era and the rise of independent directors, he also wrote 37 books on movies and filmmakers and wrote or directed more than 30 documentaries, mostly for television. He shared or received three Emmy nominations, for \u201cLife Goes to the Movies\u201d in 1976 and \u201cMinnelli on Minnelli: Liza Remembers Vincente\u201d in 1987. Richard Zoglin, a fellow critic and now a contributing editor at Time, said that what distinguished Mr. Schickel among his peers was his comprehensive knowledge of the movie industry\u2019s players and processes coupled with \u201can astute critical sensibility\u201d that resisted the trendy. \u201cHe wrote from the perspective of a film insider,\u201d Mr. Zoglin said in a phone interview, \u201cbut responded to films from a gut level and never lost the sense of being an average filmgoer reacting to what was on the screen. \u201d Mr. Schickel pulled no punches. Reviewing Stanley Kramer\u2019s \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d in 1967, the interracial love story starring Sidney Poitier, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Mr. Schickel groused, \u201cKramer is earnestly preaching away on matters that have long ceased to be true issues. \u201d He even dismissed \u201cThe Maltese Falcon,\u201d John Huston\u2019s 1941 film noir classic starring Humphrey Bogart, as \u201ccramped and static\u201d and was damning in a retrospective look at \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d in The Atlantic in 1973. Mr. Schickel wrote that two measures of a movie\u2019s quality should be how much a viewer retains and how much one wants to see it again. By both measures, he loved \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d \u201cDouble Indemnity,\u201d \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d \u201cChinatown,\u201d \u201cFargo,\u201d \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy,\u201d \u201cPinocchio\u201d and the original \u201cKing Kong,\u201d as well as outliers like Audie Murphy\u2019s western \u201cNo Name on the Bullet\u201d and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cThe 400 Blows. \u201d Mr. Schickel did not view filmgoing as an experience frozen in memory. \u201cYou loved \u2018My Friend Flicka\u2019 when you saw it at age 10,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you see it at age 65, you may respect it, but you won\u2019t think it\u2019s a masterpiece (which does not mean you should deprive your grandchildren of the pleasure of seeing this picture when they are the perfect age for it). \u201d He also understood that the public\u2019s perception of his role had evolved. A critic, he told The Hedgehog Review in 2005, is \u201ca very endangered species in a nation that wants indulgence more than a criticism that questions its fatuity. \u201d But responding to an article in The New York Times, which suggested that blogging might be making book reviewing more democratic, he wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 2007: \u201cCriticism  \u2014   and its humble cousin, reviewing  \u2014   is not a democratic activity. It is, or should be, an elite enterprise, ideally undertaken by individuals who bring something to the party beyond their hasty, instinctive opinions of a book (or any other cultural object). It is work that requires disciplined taste, historical and theoretical knowledge and a fairly deep sense of the author\u2019s (or filmmaker\u2019s or painter\u2019s) entire body of work, among other qualities. \u201d Richard Warren Schickel was born on Feb. 10, 1933, in Milwaukee, the son of Edward Schickel, who worked in advertising, and the former Helen Hendricks, a docent. He was named for an ancestor, Richard Warren, who arrived on the Mayflower. He was raised in suburban Wauwatosa, Wis. and escaped to the movies on weekends with friends, he wrote in a memoir, \u201cGood Morning, Mr. Zip Zip Zip: Movies, Memory, and World War II\u201d (2003) \u201cbecause the serene and placid little world I inhabited as a kid was so lacking in romantic and heroic adventure. \u201d He saw Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Great Dictator\u201d when he was 8. \u201cI mimed enchantment for my parents\u2019 benefit,\u201d he wrote in American Heritage magazine in 2006. \u201cI did a lot of that in those days. They were so sweetly earnest, as I now appreciatively recall, about introducing me to \u2018the finer things.\u2019 Their problem back then was finding, in Milwaukee, finer things for me to appreciate. \u201d Mr. Schickel graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1955 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and moved to New York, where he freelanced for magazines and reviewed his first film, \u201cA Boy Ten Feet Tall,\u201d starring Edward G. Robinson, in 1965. He described it as \u201cquite a good little movie. \u201d His marriage to Julia Carroll Whedon, a writer, ended in divorce. In addition to their daughter Erika, who is also a writer, he is survived by another daughter from that marriage, Jessica Vild a stepdaughter, Ali Rubinstein, from his second marriage, to the former Carol Rubinstein, a TV producer who died in 1991 and four grandchildren. His books included biographies of Woody Allen, Marlon Brando, James Cagney, Charlie Chaplin, Gary Cooper, Clint Eastwood, Lena Horne and Elia Kazan. His documentaries include a PBS series, \u201cThe Men Who Made the Movies. \u201d \u201cThe truth, very simply, is that most movies are lousy or, at best, routine,\u201d Mr. Schickel wrote in \u201cKeepers: The Greatest Films  \u2014   and Personal Favorites  \u2014   of a Moviegoing Lifetime\u201d (2015). \u201cWe go to see them, much of the time, in search of something else  \u2014   the comforting darkness of the theater, the play of light and shadow on the screen, the consolations they offer for some temporary trouble,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA lot of the time we don\u2019t give a hoot what\u2019s playing. We are at a public event for private reasons which we don\u2019t always recognize until later, if at all. It is the occasion, the atmosphere, that we crave. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564301.3091283}
