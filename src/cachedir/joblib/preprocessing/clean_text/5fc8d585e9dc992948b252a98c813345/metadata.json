The separatist and the terrorist have announced their decision to participate in Ravish Kumar\u2019s show as mime artists. \\n\u201cNobody has done more for the Kashmir freedom struggle than Barkha Dutt ji,\u201d raved Geelani to our correspondent. \u201cI know that I am recognized as the leader of Kashmiri freedom, but truth be told, my commitment to the cause pales in comparison to Barkha ji\u2019s. She used her brilliance and blamed terrorism in the valley on the rise of hindutva in India! She has highlighted a plan of blaming the burning of schools on Diwali crackers. She is a true Kashmiri patriot. Just as Jinnah is the Father of the Nation in Pakistan, we hope to make Barkha ji the Mother of the Nation when we\u2019ll get our freedom. The least I can do is show solidarity with NDTV. I will dress as a mime artist on Ravish\u2019s next show,\u201d said Geelani before excusing himself to practice miming for the show. \\nHafiz Saeed was harder to track down. But our stringers in Pakistan reported that the 26/11 mastermind had been inconsolable ever since the government announced its decision to ban NDTV for a day and had spent an entire day binge watching \u2018The Buck Stops Here\u2019 with teary eyes. When the tears dried up, he sprang to his feet, yelled \u201cYeh sab RAW ne kiya hai!\u201d and decided to join the battle for Freedom Of Expression by joining Ravish\u2019s show as a mime artist. \\nIn other news, Arun Jaitley was spotted creating several Bot accounts on Twitter and retweeting Barkha Dutt\u2019s tweets. \\n(Reported by Citizen Satirist Natasha )'"}, "time": 1742628561.369222}
