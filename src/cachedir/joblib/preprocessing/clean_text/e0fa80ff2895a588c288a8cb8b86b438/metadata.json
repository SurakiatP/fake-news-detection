[According to local reports, 300 students donated a total of some 600 Riyals through the institute.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s educational and governmental institutions forbid female students and employees to wear pants. Management at the institute reversed their decision, however, seemingly due to outside pressure from religious figures in the kingdom. A notification sent to students stated that the decision was being cancelled and that students would have to return to uniform attire. The management stressed that the attire must include a long and wide skirt with a    shirt and long sleeves. The students were also invited to contact student services within 20 days to ask for their donations back. The original decision and its reversal sparked debate on social media, with one Twitter user, Abou Ahmad, writing, \u201cWhy is there a price here for values, and a very cheap price of two Riyals. And I innocently thought that values couldn\u2019t be bought and sold! !!\u201d @Akhbaar24 \u0644\u064a\u0634 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0626 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u062b\u0645\u0646\u060c \u0648\u062b\u0645\u0646 \u0631\u062e\u064a\u0635 \u201d\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0646\u201d \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0636\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0626 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0628\u0627\u0639 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0649! !!  \u2014   \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f (@aboahmad7777777) May 26, 2017,  Faesal wrote on Twitter, \u201cImproper conduct by the institute\u2019s management.
