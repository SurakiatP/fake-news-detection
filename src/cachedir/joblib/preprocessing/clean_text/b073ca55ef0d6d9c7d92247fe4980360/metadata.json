Sen. Harry Reid (D \u2013 NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret \u201cexplosive\u201d evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. \\nFBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they\u2019ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. \\nThe Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI\u2019s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven\u2019t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. \\nThe Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn\u2019t stop Clinton from calling Trump a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday\u2019s FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. \\nWith Clinton\u2019s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that won\u2019t be happening.  \""}, "time": 1742561615.6378362}
