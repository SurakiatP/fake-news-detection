Trump\u2019s push for considerably faster growth. The Fed cited the steady growth of employment and other economic measures, and signaled that it expects to raise rates more quickly next year to prevent the economy from growing too quickly. \u201cMy colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said at a news conference after the announcement. \u201cWe expect the economy will continue to perform well. \u201d The widely expected decision moves the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to a range of 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent, still very low by historical standards. Low rates support economic growth by encouraging borrowing and  . The American economy has expanded by about 2 percent a year over the last six years, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4. 6 percent. The Fed\u2019s assessment that the economy is growing at a healthy pace  \u2014   not too hot, not too cold  \u2014   is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump, who has promised 4 percent growth and has described job creation as \u201cterrible\u201d and economic growth as anemic. Already on Wednesday, one Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Roger Williams of Texas, criticized the Fed\u2019s move. \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Fed to raise the interest rate is entirely premature and will be burdensome to a nation already struggling to pull itself out of this   Obama economy,\u201d Mr. Williams said in a statement. \u201cBy making rates even higher, the Fed is effectively making our hardships even harder. \u201d Mr. Williams did not object when the Fed raised rates last December. In announcing the decision after a   meeting of the Fed\u2019s   committee, the central bank gave little indication that Mr. Trump\u2019s election had altered its economic outlook. The Fed said it still expected a slow economic expansion and a steady march toward higher rates. In separate forecasts also published Wednesday, Fed officials predicted three rate increases in 2017. For the first time in recent years, however, there is a real possibility of significant changes in fiscal policy. Republicans will control the White House and both chambers of Congress, and Mr. Trump has promised to increase economic growth and job creation through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Those measures could spur faster growth after a presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump regularly disparaged the economy\u2019s performance under President Obama. But the Fed reiterated Wednesday that the economy is already expanding at roughly the maximum sustainable pace. Fed officials also see evidence that the labor market is tightening. Several Fed districts reported labor shortages in the central bank\u2019s most recent compilation of economic reports. In the Philadelphia district, construction workers are hard to find. Atlanta reported a shortage of nurses Kansas City, truck drivers Dallas, tech workers. Faster growth, in the Fed\u2019s judgment, would probably lead to higher inflation. As a result, if Republicans succeed in invigorating growth, the Fed is likely to raise rates more quickly. The greater the stimulus, the faster interest rates are likely to rise. \u201cYour expectation should depend very little on what you think that the F. O. M. C. is thinking and very much on your view of Trump policies and their macro effects,\u201d said Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on the Fed. As James Carville regularly reminded the other Clinton on the campaign trail: It\u2019s the economy, stupid. \u201d Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed was not prejudging the likely course of events. She declined several times to comment on the merits of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans or to predict their consequences for the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. Fed officials predicted that they would raise the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate a little more quickly in the coming years, reaching 2. 1 percent by the end of 2018. In September, they had predicted that it would reach 1. 9 percent by the end of 2018. The new projections, however, reflect a significantly slower pace of increase than last December, when they expected the rate to reach 3. 3 percent by 2018. The combination of steady growth and faster rate increases indicates that some Fed officials expect the central bank to end up offsetting a modest increase in fiscal stimulus. But Ms. Yellen said most Fed officials were reserving judgment. \u201cChanges in fiscal policy or other economic policies could affect the economic outlook,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, it is far too early to know how those changes will unfold. \u201d The tensions between monetary and fiscal policy will develop slowly. Legislation takes time to write, and any economic impact would generally be felt in coming years. Political pressures, however, may build more quickly. Mr. Trump has made clear in the past that he likes low interest rates  \u2014   and some of his plans, like infrastructure investment, will be much easier to fund if rates remain low. \u201cThe Fed is in a tricky place,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cThey\u2019re trying not to prejudge how Congress and the administration duke it out, but once they see that, I think they will respond. \u201d There is also uncertainty about the Fed\u2019s leadership. Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman ends in February 2018, and Mr. Trump has said he would prefer a Republican. Ms. Yellen could remain on the board, a possibility she said Wednesday she had not ruled out. But the Fed, under different leadership, might well choose a different path forward. Some conservative economists, notably John Taylor of Stanford University, argue that the bank should already have raised rates above 1 percent. The economy, for now, keeps plodding along. Steady job growth has reduced the unemployment rate to a level the Fed considers healthy. A little unemployment is natural as people change jobs and businesses close. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have said they see some signs of stronger wage growth. Inflation, too, has picked up a little in recent months, although both wages and inflation continue to rise more slowly than the Fed would like to see. Ms. Yellen described the rate increase as \u201ca vote of confidence in the economy. \u201d The decision was made by a unanimous vote of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the first time in recent months the Fed has acted by consensus. Some economists argue that the Fed should wait until inflation strengthens before raising rates, to test whether a stronger economy would persuade some people sidelined during the downturn to start looking for jobs. That would expand the labor force. Unemployment remains particularly high among minorities. That view, however, has found little support among Fed officials, who worry that interest rates will have to be raised more quickly if they wait too long, increasing the chances of pushing the economy into recession. \u201cApparently, Fed officials think the economy is growing too quickly,\u201d said Ady Barkan, the director of Fed Up, a coalition of liberal groups that has pressed the Fed to continue its stimulus campaign. \u201cI doubt you can find many other Americans who share that opinion. And it\u2019s a strange conclusion to draw in the wake of an election that was so heavily impacted by voters\u2019 economic discontent. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561648.3766832}
