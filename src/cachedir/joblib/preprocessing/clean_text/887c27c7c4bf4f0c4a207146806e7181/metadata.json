[\u201cUntil February, Andrew Stiern could only speak with his girlfriend on a phone in a prison day hall while 10 other inmates listened in and waited impatiently in line behind him,\u201d reported The Denver Post . \u201cNow the    inmate can kick back in the limited privacy of his cell at Four Mile Correctional Center in Ca\u00f1on City and call his girl on a new computer tablet anytime between 6 a. m. and 10 p. m. He can also use the same device to listen to his favorite tunes from a streaming cache of 12 million songs, read books or play video games to his heart\u2019s content. \u201d  GTL Corp\u2019s Inspire pilot program seeks to distribute tablets to over 18, 000 prison inmates, and eventually to every prisoner in the United States, according to The Denver Post. It is reportedly \u201cdesigned to give inmates access to a wide range of media, including educational programming, but also creates a new revenue stream for GTL, which specializes in inmate telecommunications and payment systems. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great. I\u2019m kind of the tablet rep guy,\u201d said inmate Andrew Stiern to The Post. \u201cWhen you are in prison, you are cut off from the outside world. You want your mind to be focused on positive things. It\u2019s kind of an escape from this world. These tabs have become a new piece of life in here. \u201d Though some believe that the tablets could help deflate friction between prison gangs over prison phone use, other correctional officers and victims group representatives are skeptical of the program. \u201cI\u2019m a little stunned. They are not there to be catered to and offered all the comforts of home,\u201d said Rob Wells, the president of Families of Victims of Homicide and Missing Persons. \u201cI\u2019m not pleased with it. Some of them are gang members and have been involved in some pretty nasty stuff. They shouldn\u2019t be given something that will give them an opportunity to continue their criminal enterprises in prison. How are they going to monitor this?\u201d \u201cAll of us had our reservations at first. Are we going to be more vulnerable because of this technology?\u201d asked corrections officer Ryan Flores. \u201cThere was a lot of old school mentality. \u201d Though GTL are giving out the tablets    to prisoners, there is a potential profit to be made through their use. A   subscription for one prisoner to access a database of music and games costs $6. 59, while text messages are 25 cents each. A   phone call costs around $2 to $3. As well as entertainment and education, the tablets can also be used to file complaints, order snacks, contact medical staff, and sign up for prison programs. Despite their ability to contact others outside of the prison, the tablets are not connected to the internet, and inmates are unable to contact others in the prison through the devices. There are also no violent video games available. \u201cThese are games I allow my    to play,\u201d said one inmate to The Post. \u201cThe most violent game is, like, \u2018Angry Birds. \u2019\u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
