He knows the difference between intelligence and evidence. Let me tell you something, Alisyn, if you\u2019re an American citizen, and the National Security Agency collects intelligence, that is intercepts of Russians, who report what you\u2019ve said, do you think it\u2019s fair to go to a court and say that\u2019s evidence that you did something wrong? That\u2019s why the FBI is going to a year or more to investigate this, because the American citizens involved in this have a right to have evidence presented in a court beyond a conversation that a Russian official reports. In my world, this distinction is black and white. It is a hard line. I know it\u2019s frustrating for the American people. But I hope they don\u2019t want evidence to be perceived as something that a Russian official says, and that\u2019s it, you can be convicted on that. It\u2019s not. \u201d (  WFB) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563794.589924}
