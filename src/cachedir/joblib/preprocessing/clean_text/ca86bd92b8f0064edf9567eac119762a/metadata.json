Unlike other vote swapping schemes which pair a voter in a swing state with a voter in a \u2018safe\u2019 state, a vote pact pairs voters across party lines who each promise to cast their ballots for a third-party candidate instead.   Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein, foreground, meets her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016. \\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Third-party candidates are often accused of acting as \u201cspoilers\u201d by siphoning votes from the two major parties\u2019 nominees and potentially tipping the balance in an election. \\nPerhaps the most notable example of this is Ralph Nader. The former Green Party candidate is frequently accused of helping George W. Bush win the 2000 presidential election by diverting votes which otherwise would have gone to Democratic nominee Al Gore, although this theory has been disproven many times . \\n\u201cA lot of people have basically grown to depend on the confines of the two-party system and have a hard time getting their brain around a constructive, strategic path out of it,\u201d Sam Husseini, a political activist, told MintPress News. \\nHusseini proposed an alternative strategy in which voters form \u201cvoting pacts\u201d across party lines. For example, a Democrat and a Republican might each agree to vote for a third-party candidate of their choice, rather than the two major parties\u2019 candidates. The strategy reduces the potential for \u201cspoiling\u201d votes, as long as voting pacts don\u2019t cross state lines, because each of the major candidates loses voters equally. \\nHusseini operates the website VotePact.org to encourage this method of vote sharing or vote pairing. Letter in Wash Post: \u201cVotePact Offers Voters a Sensible Alternative\u201d \u2014 how #NeverTrump & #NeverHillary can pair up: https://t.co/HB3CtnGGdi \\n\u2014 votepact (@votepact) August 30, 2016 \\n\u201cIt has the potential for being a catalyst for genuine realignment and perhaps even for a victory for a so-called third party or independent candidate creative enough to use such a strategy,\u201d Husseini said. \\nThird-party candidates frequently urge voters to follow their conscience rather opt for one of the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d selected by the two-party system. As Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein frequently says , \u201cWe need to stand up and fight for the greater good like our lives depend on it.\u201d \\nHusseini said he\u2019d like to see third-party candidates embrace vote pacts instead of dismissing spoiler claims. He suggested they should also urge their supporters to form vote pacts as a way to safely support third-party movement building. Here\u2019s how Husseini imagines the idea being pitched by a candidate: \u201cThere\u2019s a way out of this. You feel like you gotta vote for Clinton because you hate Trump. I get that. Lots of people are like that and lots of people are on the other side. Well, they should pair up and both vote for me.\u201d \\nHe continued: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any third-party candidate do that, which is why I think they\u2019re going to remain in single digits\u201d in the popular vote. \\nOther forms of \u201cvote swapping\u201d have been proposed during this and previous elections, usually seeking to pair a voter from a swing state with a voter from a state \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d state. The voter in the so-called \u201csafe state\u201d agrees to vote for a third-party candidate in return for securing a vote for their preferred candidate in a state where the election is in play. \\nThis \u201csafe state\u201d strategy was especially popular in 2000, when voters sought to trade Nader and Gore votes. That election prompted a court case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that that vote swapping is \u201cclearly protected by the First Amendment.\u201d \\nLast month, Husseini told Bustle\u2019s Am\u00e9e Latour that the \u201csafe state\u201d strategy just \u201ckicks the can down the road.\u201d Third parties often hope to secure 5 percent of the popular vote in presidential races, which would unlock millions in additional federal funding for future elections, but Husseini thinks by embracing vote pacts they could potentially win elections outright. \\n\u201cThe other so-called \u2018strategies\u2019 are basically a way of minimizing the so-called \u2018damage\u2019 of third-party runs,\u201d he told MintPress. \\nWhile Husseini said he hopes alternative candidates will someday make vote pacts a key part of their campaign strategy, he also stressed that it isn\u2019t too late for voters to embrace the idea in the 2016 election. Vote pacts require mutual trust between political opponents, so he recommends forming them with family members, close friends, and coworkers across party lines. \\nHe also said voting pacts could spur political change by encouraging people to engage in challenging political conversations across party lines rather than simply shutting out opposing views. \\n\u201cInstead unfriending that guy who said he might vote for Trump because he hates Clinton, reach out to them.\u201d Be Sociable, Share!'"}, "time": 1742562044.586126}
