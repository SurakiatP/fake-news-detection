(Photo by Reuters) \\nThe Fourth High Criminal Court of Bahrain has sentenced 15 political opponents to long jail terms and also revoked the citizenship of all of them. While several international rights groups have criticized the Al Khalifa regime\u2019s harsh crackdown on the Bahraini opposition, the Western powers turn a blind eye to the Arab state\u2019s violations of human rights. \\nEdward Corrigan, an international human rights lawyer, told Press TV\u2019s Top 5 program that the Western powers are trying to whitewash the crimes committed by the Arab dictatorships in the Persian Gulf region because such regimes are considered the West\u2019s \u201clap dogs.\u201d \\n\u201cThere is a double standard,\u201d Corrigan said, explaining that Western powers say, \u201c\u2018If you are a friend of ours and do what we want and give us oil and invest your money into European or American economy, we won\u2019t question your human rights violations.\u2019\u201d \\nAccording to the analyst, \u201cThere is hypocrisy, double standards and this is really a big political game. Our dictatorships and allies are OK but somebody else that we don\u2019t like for whatever reason, we magnify their crimes and even create false flags and do other things to try to discredit them.\u201d \\nElsewhere in his remarks, Corrigan said the definition of terrorism in Bahrain covers any kind of opposition, because the regime does \u201cnot want to allow any sort of political movements there to try to reform the system, to redress this massive discrimination against the Shia population, and to have any sort of voice for democracy; so, all of that is \u2018terrorism.\u2019\u201d \\nHe added, \u201cIt is against the international law to remove people\u2019s nationality from them and this is an extreme sort of punishment, very draconian, as they\u2019re condemned by the international human rights organizations and other organizations.\u201d \\nManama has been cracking down on dissent since February 2011, when an uprising began against the regime. Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of Al Khalifah regime\u2019s harsh crackdown on anti-regime activists.
