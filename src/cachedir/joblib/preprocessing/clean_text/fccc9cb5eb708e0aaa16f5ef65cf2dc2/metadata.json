Mulvaney said, \u201cThe president knows who the voters are. His voters are folks who pay taxes as well. And I think or the first time in a long time, you have an administration looking at the compassion of both sides of the equation. Not just the compassion in terms of where the money go but in terms of where the money comes from. Could we as an administration, could I as a budget director look at a coal miner in West Virginia and say I want you to give money to the federal government so I can give it to the National Endowment for the Arts. We finally got to the point in the administration where we couldn\u2019t do that. You owe $60, 000 to the government. So do I in terms of the debt. The president said let\u2019s take care of both sides of the equation. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563251.6704748}
