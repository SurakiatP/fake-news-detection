Stephanapolous said that while people are determined to go back to their normal lives, \u201cthis is also likely to inflame   sentiment across Britain, across Europe. \u201d Raddatz responded, \u201cIt sure could, George. You know, Manchester itself is a very multicultural city. There\u2019s a large Muslim population, with many there for generations. So, a headscarf attracts little attention there.
