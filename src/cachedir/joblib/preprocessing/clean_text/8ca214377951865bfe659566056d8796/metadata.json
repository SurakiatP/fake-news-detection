Far from retreating, the band instead planned a short summer tour, by turns jubilant and wrenching, that has transfixed much of Canada for the last month. Kingston, the group\u2019s hometown, was the last stop. Mr. Downie arrived onstage at the Rogers   arena  \u2014   on The Tragically Hip Way  \u2014   in a suit and jauntily feathered hat, and, with his four bandmates of over 30 years, tore through a   set of   hits and lyrical deep cuts. The mood was triumphal: The concert started after a spontaneous audience rendition of \u201cO Canada\u201d and ended with three encores. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said he had been a fan since high school, was there, in a black Tragically Hip  . \u201cThis is a moment that\u2019s going to be extremely powerful for all Canadians, I know,\u201d he said in a live interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation before the show. \u201cGord and the Tragically Hip are an inevitable and essential part of what we are and who we are as a country. And tonight we get to say thanks, and we get to celebrate that. \u201d With a nationally televised live stream on Saturday, people gathered to witness what could be Mr. Downie\u2019s last major outing with the Hip, a rock act that is \u201cour Stones, our Hendrix, our Zeppelin, our Bob Dylan, all wrapped up in one awesome band,\u201d as one Kingston fan, Wes Guidry, put it. There were viewing events in hockey arenas, town squares, clubs and restaurants from the Yukon to Nova Scotia, and in United States towns near the border, like Plattsburgh, N. Y. \u201cDear World,\u201d the Toronto police wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. \u201cPlease be advised that Canada will be closed tonight at 8:30 p. m. Have a #TragicallyHip day. \u201d In terms of national attention, the Kingston concert was \u201canalogous to the Super Bowl,\u201d said Randy Lennox, president of broadcasting and content for Bell Media, a major Canadian broadcaster. Mr. Lennox, who previously ran Universal Canada, the Tragically Hip\u2019s label, and who has known the band members since 1988, said that Mr. Downie is to Canada what Bono is to Ireland. \u201cThis is indigenous, this is a band that is our soul,\u201d he said. (Mr. Downie has declined interview requests.) Since its first studio album in 1989, the Hip, as the band is widely known, has risen from a   bar band to one whose dense lyrics, touching on hockey players and heroes of the Canadian wilderness, now invite close reading  \u2014   \u201ca proletarian group with an intellectual sensibility,\u201d as the Canadian cultural essayist and novelist Stephen Marche wrote in The New Yorker. \u201c  hockey fans howl their biggest anthems in parking lots after games assistant professors of Canadian literature listen to their later work while jogging. \u201d Though they\u2019ve had a few legs up  \u2014   in 1995 Dan Aykroyd, a longtime fan and fellow Canadian, brought them to play on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d  \u2014   their success never translated south. But being a uniquely Canadian phenomenon (they\u2019re on a stamp) has endeared them even further at home. \u201cWe\u2019re a country that hasn\u2019t really embraced its history just yet,\u201d said the musician Kevin Drew, of Broken Social Scene. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure out what makes us Canadian, and we have one of the loudest neighbors in the world, so this band helped a country, and Gord helped people lyrically, slowly start to try to define themselves. \u201d With Dave Hamelin, Mr. Drew was a producer on the Hip\u2019s most recent album, \u201cMan Machine Poem,\u201d which was recorded, he said, before Mr. Downie\u2019s December cancer diagnosis, and released in June, shortly after the band announced it. In the studio, Mr. Drew said, he saw the fluidity of three decades of musicianship among the Hip\u2019s other members: the bassist Gord Sinclair, the guitarists Paul Langlois and Rob Baker, and the drummer Johnny Fay. \u201cI saw them write a song in three minutes once,\u201d he said. \u201cIt blew my mind. \u201d And Mr. Downie was as open and   as a novice. \u201cHe would be pacing around, saying, \u2018Let\u2019s go as far as we can,\u2019\u201d Mr. Drew said. \u201cGord pushes you to be your best,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why people come to his shows and sing their guts out, because they feel like their best selves. \u201d The Hip has had a deep impact on the Canadian musical scene. Allan Reid, president and chief executive of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Juno Awards, the Canadian Grammys, called the Hip \u201cthe best rock band this country has ever seen. \u201d (The band has earned 14 Junos.) Geddy Lee, frontman for Rush, for whom the Hip once opened, praised them in an email for their \u201cblues based, sinewy, guitar rock combined with Gord\u2019s original poetic style of lyrics. \u201d He attended one of their Toronto shows this month  \u2014   \u201can incredibly heartfelt and moving experience,\u201d he said, \u201cone I shall never forget. \u201d And band members continue to mentor younger acts, like Arkells, which opened for them recently. \u201cThere\u2019s a Gord line I love,\u201d from the record \u201cNow for Plan A,\u201d the Arkells singer, Max Kerman, wrote in an email: \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t want to do it. We want to be it.\u2019 Gord committed himself to a life of music and performance art in an incredibly profound way. \u201d At a Pearl Jam concert in Wrigley Field in Chicago on Saturday, Eddie Vedder dedicated the song \u201cLight Years\u201d to the Hip. \u201cTheir poetry is staggering,\u201d said Sarah Polley, the Canadian actress and filmmaker, who covered the Hip\u2019s song \u201cCourage\u201d for her 1997 film, \u201cThe Sweet Hereafter. \u201d \u201cThey are the soundtrack of this country in so many ways. \u201d Ms. Polley was also at one of their recent Toronto shows. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a gift that they\u2019ve let us say thank you with this tour,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cI bought a grilled cheese sandwich yesterday and the guy serving me started talking about them and the two of us just stood there and wept together without apology or embarrassment. \u201d The tour has also become a   mission: Mr. Downie, whose cancer, glioblastoma, is not curable, started a brain cancer research fund at the Sunnybrook Foundation, a health center affiliated with the University of Toronto, and the Canadian Cancer Society was also expecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations this weekend, a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe gesture and the courageousness of doing what they were doing wasn\u2019t lost on anyone,\u201d said Mr. Drew, who was at shows in Toronto and Kingston. Though Mr. Downie relied on teleprompters for help with lyrics, and was not as kinetic as in the past, the performances \u201cwere exceptional,\u201d Mr. Drew said. \u201cThe detail, the care  \u2014   they were there and they were present. They pushed themselves. \u201d In the final moments of many of their recent shows, Mr. Downie has been alone onstage, looking out into a roaring audience. \u201cIt\u2019s an implicit goodbye, without being overt,\u201d Mr. Lennox, the media executive and Mr. Downie\u2019s longtime friend, said. But at the end of their show in Kingston, for their   about final song, the Hip simply played one of their biggest hits, \u201cAhead by a Century,\u201d a 1996   pop song about childhood innocence, beloved and performed by gymnasiums full of Canadian schoolchildren for years. The night felt, Mr. Drew said, \u201chopeful. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628409.2439337}
