Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nSince Republicans have essentially conceded that Donald Trump is going to lose the general election to Hillary Clinton, they\u2019re already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate Supreme Court justices. \\nAccording to a report from the Huffington Post on Wednesday, one conservative thinker says that John McCain\u2019s recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by Clinton isn\u2019t that farfetched. \\nThe report: \\nSome conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to McCain\u2019s controversial suggestion last week that Senate Republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all Supreme Court nominees put forth by a future President Hillary Clinton. \\nWho needs a fully functioning Supreme Court after all? \\n\u201cAs a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,\u201d wrote the Cato Institute\u2019s Ilya Shapiro in a column Wednesday on The Federalist. \\nShapiro is well-versed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. Nothing in the Constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nation\u2019s highest court \u2015 if not an entire branch of the federal government \u2015 to stop Clinton from selecting judges who share her views. \\n\u2026 \\nTo Shapiro, there\u2019s nothing wrong with even more Senate obstructionism because \u201cthe Constitution is completely silent\u201d on how the upper chamber provides its \u201cadvice and consent\u201d on the president\u2019s nominees. \\n\u2026 \\n\u201cSo when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names,\u201d he concluded. \\nThe original argument from Republicans was that they would block President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the Nov. 8 election. Forget the fact that this isn\u2019t how the constitutional system is meant to operate, but that was their reasoning. \\nNow, faced with the growing prospect that Hillary Clinton will be elected the 45th President of the United States, they are beginning to change their tune. \\nThe obstruction that defined the Republican Party throughout Obama\u2019s presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone. It\u2019s yet another reason why down-ballot races are more critical than ever this year.'"}, "time": 1742563593.0914528}
