When I was 22, I used to have a fantasy about going away to a sanitarium, like in \u201cThe Magic Mountain. \u201d I would do nothing but sit on balconies, wrapped in steamer rugs, and go to the doctor, avoiding the rigors of the real world and emerging after a short period brighter, happier, better. I\u2019m beginning to think this was a prescient impulse. Over the decades we have embraced a widening and diverse array of practices and traditions, but the idea that we can be improved  \u2014   in mind, body or spirit  \u2014   has remained a constant. That this could be accomplished with money and in an allotted parcel of time has become increasingly popular with a generation reared in a maximalist minimalist moment that, as with fashion and interior design, demands grandiose,   freedom from the world. If stuff was once an indicator of security, now the very lack of it  \u2014   of dust, of furniture, of body fat, of errant thoughts  \u2014   defines aspiration. A glamorous    exercise in pricey   has become the logical way to spend one\u2019s leisure time. We live in a golden age of the \u201cwellness vacation,\u201d a sort of hybrid retreat, boot camp, spa and roving therapy session that, for the cost of room and board, promises to refresh body and mind and send you back to your life more whole. Pravassa, a \u201cwellness travel company,\u201d summarizes its (trademarked) philosophy as \u201cBreathe. Experience. Move. Mindfulness. Nourish. \u201d (The Kripalu Center for Yoga  Health, a wellness retreat in New England, boasts the eerily similar tagline: \u201cBreathe. Connect. Move. Discover. Shine. \u201d) A   trip to Thailand with Pravassa includes a travel guide  \u2014   who works, in her day job, as a \u201c  psychotherapist\u201d in Atlanta  \u2014   as well as temple pilgrimages at dawn and, more abstractly, the potential to bring all that mindfulness back home with you. Selfies are not only allowed but encouraged. Whatever happened to a good book and a martini? If in the recent past people\u2019s idea of a vacation conjured images of Caribbean resorts and swingers\u2019 parties, the idea of taking time off as a means of   still has strong precedents. For as long as Americans have worked regular hours, many have tried to make good spiritual use of their time off. As Cindy Aron explains in her comprehensive \u201cWorking at Play: A History of Vacations in the United States,\u201d the modern notion of \u201cvacation\u201d was initially the purview of the wealthy, and inextricably bound up with the idea of health. Hubs like Niagara or Saratoga were wholesome retreats from the dirt (and populations) of cities, where the air and water were both rarefied. In the   century, a class of   vacationers emerged and gradually changed the   retreats into the more democratic  \u2014   and    \u2014   destinations we know today. The concept of a purely fun break came later. Spiritual retreats were less   and, when under the rubric of religious communities (as many of the 19th and 20th centuries were) actively salutary. The new wellness vacations are a kind of steroidal response to movements like Chautauqua, founded by Methodists in the 19th century to encourage lifelong learning and spiritual growth. In beautiful compounds, attendees could  \u2014   and indeed, still can  \u2014   take classes and hear music and sermons. For many   Americans, the opportunity for continuing education, communion with nature and polite, wholesome society  \u2014   absent of evils like alcohol or dancing  \u2014   would have been a luxury indeed. But sophisticates like Sinclair Lewis and H. L. Mencken mocked the earnestness of communities like Chautauqua Lewis described this   learning as \u201cnothing but wind and chaff and . .. the laughter of yokels. \u201d Lewis is lucky that those early Chautauquans didn\u2019t have smartphones. The wellness vacation in its current form is all the easier to mock: As has ever before been the case, spirituality plus money makes for an open target, but add in the fact that nothing really counts today unless everyone witnesses it. If an enlightenment retreat happens in a forest and nobody\u2019s there to Instagram the sunrise, does it even exist? Our idea of spirituality and mindfulness also includes the attempt to project these ideas by distilling them to images of   multihued   juices and toned women striking poses in silhouette against stunning natural backdrops. If this projection is a mark of sophistication and privilege, so much the better. The humanist founders of Esalen were genuinely dedicated to the expansion of consciousness that the Big Sur retreat should become a byword for trendy spiritual   (and an ambivalent punch line on \u201cMad Men\u201d) is a sign of its importance. As ideas, like the \u201cPray\u201d portion of Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s popular book, move into the cultural mainstream and lose their purity  \u2014   as they become inextricably tied up with capitalism, really  \u2014   it\u2019s easy for us,   to sneer. I, however, get the appeal. For all the spiritual work, and all the hikes, and all the sunrise yoga, and all the   once you get there, as with my childhood sanitarium fantasy, you don\u2019t have to make many decisions. Wellness vacations are planned for you, companions allocated, menus chosen. Even your breathing is dictated. We crave direction helplessness is truly the ultimate luxury, a philosophy that has by now entered the mainstream. And yet, read another way, the point is to pay people to wait on you, while feeling great about it. But why should anyone be blamed for wanting to, quite literally, better themselves? Karl Lagerfeld counts exercise and vacations as two of the many things he despises. More mysteriously, I once heard Werner Herzog give a talk in which he dismissed the notion of yoga practice, saying definitively, \u201cIt\u2019s not my culture. \u201d Clearly, to the elderly German director, there is something inherently distasteful in the notion that you could take up an ancient practice, throw in some expensive leggings and call yourself evolved. Then again, the Germans gave us the \u201cThe Magic Mountain,\u201d and the resort on which Mann based his fictional sanitarium now houses participants at the World Economic Forum in Davos.'"}, "time": 1742564098.0476723}
