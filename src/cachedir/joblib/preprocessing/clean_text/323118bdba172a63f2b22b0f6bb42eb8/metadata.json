[An examination into the results of mass migration to Sweden over recent decades, \u2018Mass Challenge\u2019 was topping Sweden\u2019s book charts within days of its release earlier this month.  Sanandaji\u2019s analysis of the nation\u2019s   importation of people from the third world, the resulting social problems and the effects on Sweden\u2019s economy, is based on facts sourced from Statistics Sweden, the National Crime Prevention Council, the National Board of Health and other mainstream and respected agencies. But local media reports that Swedes who are wanting to borrow a copy of the   book from their local library are running into difficulties, with librarians rejecting Mass Challenge for political reasons. Nina Sundberg at Stockholm\u2019s Ekero library, which is refusing to stock Sanandaji\u2019s new book, argues that libraries should only purchase books which are politically correct. \u201cLibrary collections should be characterized by diversity and pluralism. The goal is to not buy books that support racism, persecution, gender stereotypes or anything else that\u2019s contrary to human rights\u201d wrote the librarian, explaining the facility\u2019s motivation in rejecting Mass Challenge. Ekero library regular Maria Halkiewicz, who had wanted to borrow the book, condemned the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s strikingly obvious that this is censorship\u201d she told Nyheteridag. On Saturday, Malm\u00f6 University lecturer Martin Kroon noted the apparent absence of Mass Challenge from Sweden\u2019s libraries in an article which asks whether politically motivated \u2018censorship\u2019 of certain titles is a problem across the country. Sanandaji has sounded the alarm on the \u201cquite disastrous\u201d effects of mass migration in Sweden for a number of years. Warning that Swedes will become a minority in their own country without a serious cut to the number of migrants it accepts, he said in 2015: \u201cThis is an irreversible social experiment that no wealthy state has ever attempted. There are almost no ideas or visions over how this can be solved. \u201cYou can\u2019t combine open borders with a welfare state. If you offer generous benefits, and anyone can come and use these benefits, a very large number of people will try to do that. It\u2019s just mathematically impossible for a small country like Sweden to fund that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562879.3445299}
