[People will be asked to vote on the question: \u201cDo you want Catalonia to be an independent state in the form of a republic,\u201d Carles Puigdemont said in Barcelona.  If Catalonia\u2019s   authorities win, they have said they will immediately start proceedings to separate from Spain. But the central government in Madrid insists the procedure is not valid and the Catalan authorities face significant challenges to even hold the referendum. Catalonia, a wealthy, 7.   region with its own language and customs, has long demanded greater autonomy. For years separatist politicians in the northeastern region have tried to win approval from Spain\u2019s central government to hold a vote similar to Scotland\u2019s 2014 independence referendum from Britain, which resulted in a \u201cno\u201d vote. And while Catalans are divided on the issue, with 48. 5 percent against independence and 44. 3 percent in favour according to the latest poll by the regional government, close to   support holding a referendum.  \u2014   \u2018I don\u2019t want it\u2019  \u2014   Catalan authorities have repeatedly been thwarted in their attempts to hold such a vote by the central government, which argues it goes against the constitution and would threaten the unity of Spain. In 2014, Catalonia held a   vote under then president Artur Mas, in which more than 80 percent of those who cast a ballot chose independence, although just 2. 3 million out of 6. 3 million eligible voters took part. But in holding the symbolic referendum, Mas went against Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court, which had outlawed the vote  \u2014   even if it was  . He was later put on trial and banned from holding office for two years. Puigdemont, though, still wants to go ahead, and he wants his referendum to be binding this time  \u2014   even though Madrid has pledged to be just as tough this time round. \u201cI don\u2019t want it, I don\u2019t believe in it, and as long as I am prime minister, it won\u2019t happen,\u201d Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in May. In February, the Constitutional Court ruled against the referendum and warned Catalan leaders they faced repercussions if they continued with their project. Catalonia\u2019s officials have had little luck pushing their project abroad either.  \u2014   Challenges to organise vote  \u2014   Regional authorities also face a host of challenges just to hold the referendum without Madrid\u2019s consent. Civil servants such as the police or the heads of schools where polling stations could be set up, for instance, will be   for the organisation of such a vote. But they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Regardless of what they support, they would have to choose between obeying their immediate superiors and facing possible sanctions for disobeying Spanish law, or sticking by the Constitution. Aside from that, none of the usual, necessary accessories of an election would be available, such as an official campaign or an independent authority to oversee the vote. And the central government has ways to stop the referendum from going ahead. It can ask the Constitutional Court to suspend Puigdemont for disobedience, or it could take temporary control of key Catalan functions such as the police.'"}, "time": 1742564014.8952153}
