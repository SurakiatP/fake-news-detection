The cut to Israel\u2019s $40 million annual contribution to the United Nations represented the portion of the UN budget allocated to four committees on Palestinian issues, the Israeli mission said. \u201cIt is unreasonable for Israel to fund bodies that operate against us at the UN,\u201d Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon said in a statement. \u201cWe seek to stop the practice where the UN is used solely as a forum for unending attacks against Israel. \u201d The announcement came a day after the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted in favor of a measure condemning the UN stance and chastising President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for abstaining in the Security Council vote. The cut in funding is the first in a series of retaliatory measures that the Israeli mission said would be taken at the United Nations after the new US administration takes office.'"}, "time": 1742564450.351435}
