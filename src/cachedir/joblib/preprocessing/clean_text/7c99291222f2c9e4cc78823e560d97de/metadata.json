Elizabeth Warren ( ) used her time at the podium giving a commencement speech at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to slam the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding President Donald\u2019s Trump decision to fire James Comey as FBI director and the Department of Justice\u2019s effort to replace him.[  Warren asked the graduates to become activists for causes and named a few, including animal rescue,   care and \u201cbullying. \u201d Then she attacked her political opponents, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t help myself. \u201d \u201cAnd I have one more: the principle that no one in this country is above the law  \u2014   and we need a justice department not an obstruction of justice department,\u201d Warren said. Warren also told the graduates that big corporations and the wealthy are trying to \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the country and it is up to them to stop it. \u201cYour elected officials are increasingly working only for the few  \u2014   the very wealthy few,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd they are setting policies only to benefit the few  \u2014   the very wealthy few. And if that doesn\u2019t change then this country will fundamentally change. \u201cIt is your world, your future that is on the line,\u201d Warren said. Warren also made several references to drinking alcohol during her speech, including mentioning a drinking game named for her, during her   speech. \u201cI understand that every extra minute I speak is that much longer before you can hit the bars,\u201d Warren said. Fortune magazine previewed Warren\u2019s speech by noting that she was on TIME magazine\u2019s list of the 100 most influential people in the world this year and included the statement by the university\u2019s Chancellor Kumble R. Subbaswamy, who called the senator \u201ca strong role model for students. \u201d \u201cWe are inspired by her staunch advocacy for equitable access to education, environmental resource conservation and support for economic justice,\u201d Subbaswamy said in a statement. \u201cThese issues are in alignment with our campus\u2019s core values and our long history of activism in pursuit of social justice. \u201d \u201cAt UMass Amherst we stand for the hopes, the ambitions, the bold experiments and the innovative solutions of the people of Massachusetts and the world beyond,\u201d Subbaswamy said. \u201cWe share Sen. Warren\u2019s commitment to making a profound, transformative contribution to the common good. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628300.4326115}
