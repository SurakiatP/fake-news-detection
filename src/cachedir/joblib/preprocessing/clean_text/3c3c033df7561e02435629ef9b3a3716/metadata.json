[BuzzFeed] _______ \u2022 Now that football season is over, it\u2019s time we shifted our focus to baseball.

[SportsNet] _______ \u2022 You\u2019ve probably heard of the \u201clone wolf\u201d terrorist. Someone who, with no direct ties to a terrorist group,   and carries out violent acts alone. But as this piece by Rukmini Callimachi shows, some of the plots we thought were the work of lone wolves were in fact \u201cremote control attacks\u201d by the Islamic State.

So that\u2019s what Nicole Kidman did. _______ \u2022 Now for something controversial: Our new baking columnist, the British chef and author Yotam Ottolenghi, makes his debut with a piece called \u201cEat Your Sugar. \u201d \u201cI rarely go a day without a slice or bite or square of something sweet. \u201d (Don\u2019t tell our Opinion columnist David Leonhardt.) _______ \u2022 \u201cEver wanted to feel nervous for 16 minutes straight?

[Missing Richard Simmons] _______ \u2022 The best magazine cover of the year is one you\u2019ve probably seen. The readers\u2019 choice selection is one you probably haven\u2019t. [ASME] _______ \u2022 Admit it: You don\u2019t read terms and conditions agreements before you sign them. One cartoonist is looking to change that bad habit with this delightful graphic novel that illustrates the iTunes legal jargon we all skip. [iTunestandc Tumblr, via A. V.
