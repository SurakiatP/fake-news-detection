[SiriusXM host Alex Marlow began with the charge that President Trump\u2019s executive order is a disguised \u201cMuslim ban\u201d or the beginning of a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to block all Muslim immigration to the United States.  \u201cWell, then I guess the Obama administration were Islamophobes, as well, because the list of seven nations  \u2014   which we\u2019ve actually reduced to six, excluding a very large country called Iraq  \u2014   that list was inherited from the Obama administration\u2019s analysis,\u201d Gorka pointed out. \u201cThe fact is, we agree with the threat analysis from the Obama administration, which also had concurrence from Congress, as well, that these are the seven nations that are most problematic when it comes to national security vetting for immigration and for refugees,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd again, I cannot make this point enough times: if there were any dread ulterior motive to this executive order with regards to Islam or Muslim nations, why is the largest Muslim nation in the world, Indonesia, not included? Why is the largest Arab Muslim nation in the world, Egypt, not included?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is about national security, very very simply. \u201d Marlow quoted an ACLU interview on National Public Radio that revealed that the crux of the argument against the new executive order will be President Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, in which he referred to a \u201cMuslim ban. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly telling,\u201d said Gorka. \u201cIt really is part and parcel of what I call the fake news phenomena. You look at the media, and they always focus in on half a sentence, on a phrase, and believe they can generate stories out of that. That\u2019s the same in this case. When you\u2019re using shorthand for a very, very significant national security exercise, it\u2019s the broader instrument that needs to be analyzed  \u2014   especially if it goes to a court of law, where somebody wishes to use legal instruments to analyze it. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear they\u2019ve tipped their hand, but yet again, if you look at the order, the text of what it predicates and why it was brought, there\u2019s absolutely no way  \u2014   in the courts or outside of the courts, using common sense  \u2014   to imply anything other than this is a national security measure that is in the purview of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly the president has the prerogative, since the 1950s, to determine who comes into the United States and against what metrics they are measured. That\u2019s not disputable. That cannot be parsed in a court of law. It is laid down in national statute. The ACLU may have an opinion, but the law remains the law. \u201d Marlow observed that some critics on the Right do not think the order went far enough, and he asked if it was meant as a negotiation or stalling tactic. \u201cWe start from simply a   determination of where the threats are. Again, the list can be shortened. You saw that it was shortened in the last month. It can be increased. There can be more nations added to it. It\u2019s a temporary measure  \u2014   very important. This is 90 days, so it\u2019s something that is about the review of the system,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cYou look at those seven nations, and there\u2019s one thing that links them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take Iran out of it. Iran is a special case because they\u2019ve been a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. Every other country is home to the new Caliphate, the Islamic State, ISIS, or is a hotbed for   activity. \u201d  \u201cThis isn\u2019t randomly chosen nations picked out of a hat. This is the most clear and present danger from individuals in active war zones, that have groups who say  \u2014   have said this in English in their propaganda product  \u2014   \u2018We will exploit the refugee streams and the migrant streams to insert our individuals, our operatives, into those flows.\u2019 It\u2019s just hard, cold analysis,\u201d said Gorka. Marlow cited a report from Fox News that about 300 refugees are currently the subjects of FBI terrorism investigations. Gorka said this was just part of a broader picture of the terrorist threat. \u201cThere have been, since September the 11, just under 600 successful terrorist prosecutions in the United States, in the last 16 years,\u201d he noted. \u201cApproximately half of those put people in prison who were not born in the United States, about half of them. And of the number that were not U. S. nationals, about three dozen were actually refugees or had asylum status. \u201d  \u201cSo again, this isn\u2019t hyperbole,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fictional hypothesizing. It\u2019s based on the facts of what\u2019s happened in the last 16 years, and most importantly, Alex, it\u2019s about preventing the next attack. Good   isn\u2019t reactive. You don\u2019t wait until 120 people have been massacred at a rock concert in Paris. You don\u2019t wait until somebody steals a truck and mows down 80 people, as in Nice. What you want to do is to prevent the bad guys coming in, and that\u2019s exactly why the president brought his order,\u201d said Gorka. Marlow quoted a complaint from the Powerline blog that Trump\u2019s executive order does not go far enough to consider the possibility that \u201csons and daughters of those who will still be admitted\u201d could become terrorists. \u201cThat\u2019s another front in the war against global jihadism or radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d said Gorka. \u201cThe author of the article should be fully aware of the fact that this administration understands that not all terrorism is done by foreign nationals or refugees,\u201d he said in response to the Powerline piece. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this. We\u2019ve seen this with Nidal Hassan. We\u2019ve seen this with other individuals here in the United States. Yes, there will be other measures taken that look at the issue of what you do with people who choose the life of jihad as a U. S. national or as somebody who grows to the age of maturity and then decides to go down that path of killing their fellow American or plotting to do so. \u201d  \u201cRemember, this is just one executive order. Nobody in the administration is positing that we are solving all counterterrorism issues with this one executive order,\u201d he promised. On the subject of detainees released from Guantanamo Bay and returning to terrorism, which President Trump addressed in a Tuesday morning tweet, Gorka said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the policies that we\u2019ve seen occur over the last eight years. \u201d \u201cWe have an unbelievably high recidivism rate from Guantanamo Bay. The president has been clear that he understands the value of Guantanamo Bay,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cWhat needs to be understood about the facility is that it\u2019s not just a detention facility. It\u2019s also a very, very important intelligence asset if you look at the kinds of people that we\u2019ve put in there and the kinds of intelligence we\u2019ve gleaned from them. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no ideology driving this administration that is about feeling good and releasing people when we feel that they\u2019re no longer a threat. If these individuals have chosen the life of jihad and are committed to it, that means in perpetuity. Unless they distance themselves from it and reject it, they remain a threat to everything this nation stands for,\u201d he declared. Gorka said President Trump\u2019s next priority is \u201cthe finalization and deployment of the   plan. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been drawn up by the generals, by Secretary Mattis, and now the final touches will be put to that plan. The intent is  \u2014   and it will happen the president said so in his joint session, when he addressed the joint session of Congress  \u2014   that we will obliterate the Islamic State and wipe this type of terrorism from the face of the earth. The next large muscle movement is going to be the   plan\u2019s implementation,\u201d he said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
