[Trump may have missed a Breitbart News exclusive investigative article penned by this reporter on February 16 titled, \u201cSoros Groups Behind Massive   Tax Day Protest Plot. \u201d  While there is no immediate information on who directly bankrolled this specific protest movement, Breitbart News found that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by George Soros or have close links to Soros financing. Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017,  Trump\u2019s tweet itself received widespread news media coverage. However, scores of major news media articles reviewed by this reporter failed to document the Soros ties to the tax march. \u201cTrump calls for investigation into Tax Day protesters, tweets \u2018election is over! \u2019\u201d reads a CNBC. com article. After noting an initial Trump tweet on the difficulty of a Republican winning the Electoral College, NBC News reported: The president then followed up by repeating an unsubstantiated claim he\u2019s made before that some of the protesters against him were \u201cpaid,\u201d an allegation that became popular in some   circles in the build up to the 2016 presidential election, before noting that the election was \u201cover. \u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s Tweets Give Tax Day Marchers at Least Part of What They Wanted,\u201d noted the headline in a Vanity Fair report. The article\u2019s   reads: \u201cHe may never release his tax returns, but thousands of marchers around the country got their message heard. \u201d The website for the Tax Day march claims that its mission is to get Trump to release his tax returns and more. The site reads: President Trump needs to be straight with the American people. To whom does he owe favors? Who are his policies really intended to benefit? Who will he put first? Working families are struggling to make ends meet, but we pay our fair share in taxes  \u2014   does Donald Trump pay any at all? A query about protest financing sent to the email address for press inquiries listed on the Tax Day March website was not answered as of this writing. Organizers of the March claim to be \u201cordinary Americans, community organizers, advocates, and people from all walks of life and all backgrounds joining together to raise our voices and send a bold message to this administration. \u201d In February, Breitbart News documented a section of the Tax Day March website titled, \u201cWho is organizing it?\u201d The website for the Tax March listed the following eight groups, six of which are either funded by Soros or tied to Soros financing. The Tax March is grateful to have the support of the following organizations: American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Tax Fairness, Center for Popular Democracy, Indivisible Project, MoveOn. Org, Our Revolution, and The Working Families Party. Americans for Tax Fairness is the recipient of a grant from Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations\u2019 U. S. Programs. MoveOn. Org is financed by Soros. The American Federation of Teachers\u2019 Educational Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the American Federation of Teachers, was financed by the Strategic Opportunities Fund of Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, leaked Open Society documents show. The Center for Popular Democracy is led by   activists. In 2013, Marbre Stahly, a policy advocate at the Center, became a Soros Justice Fellow, which comes with a stipend of $ $110, 250 to fund   activism projects that last between   months. The Center was listed as Stahly\u2019s \u201chost\u201d for the grant. According to her bio, the Center\u2019s research analyst, Maggie Corser, \u201cspent four years at the Open Society Foundations where she conducted research on the future of work, conservative political infrastructure, and a range of economic justice issues. \u201d Shawn Sebastian, the Center\u2019s field director for its Fed Up Campaign, was a fellow at the so called   Unit of the Open Society Foundations\u2019 Justice Initiative. Another Tax March organizer is the   Indivisible Project. In February, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Leaders of January\u2019s Women\u2019s March coalition reportedly helped to organize the Tax March, which USA Today described as a \u201csequel\u201d to the massive march. Buzzfeed took note of the comparison to the Women\u2019s March in a piece titled, \u201cProgressives Want Tax Day To Be The Next Women\u2019s March Protest. \u201d Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 \u201cpartners\u201d of the Women\u2019s March. This journalist first reported on the march leaders\u2019 close associations with Soros. Since Breitbart\u2019s probe in February, numerous other   groups joined the march and are listed as \u201cpartners\u201d on the group\u2019s website. The   \u201cpartners\u201d include Demos and Public Citizen, among others.  Meanwhile, at the protest itself, Rep. Maxine Waters ( .) called for Trump to be impeached.  \u201cI don\u2019t respect this president. I don\u2019t trust this president. He\u2019s not working in the best interests of the American people,\u201d complained Waters. \u201cI will fight every day until he is impeached,\u201d she stated.
