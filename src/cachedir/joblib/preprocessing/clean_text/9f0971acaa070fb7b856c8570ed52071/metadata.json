Trump promised change, and right away he\u2019s appointing a nameless robed man to lead the Department of the Hook. How\u2019s that for a shock to the system? \\nThe silent man, whose face is completely shrouded within a thick, hooded cloak, is rumored to have topped the shortlist of candidates for secretary of the Hook after emerging alone from a dense forest at night and immediately causing all greenery within the Washington beltway to wilt. \\nTrump has already lauded his nominee as \u201ca wonderful man with an absolutely tremendous cloak\u201d whom he trusts do an \u201cunbelievable job\u201d discharging the duties of the position, which include abiding by the Hook, interpreting the Covenant of the Hook, and holding aloft the candle whose flame subtracts light from its surroundings. \\n\u201cThe man in the cloak is going to be a fantastic secretary of the Hook. Just fantastic,\u201d said Trump, who added that the secretary will be second in the presidential line of succession. \u201cNo one is better qualified to enforce the covenant than this man. His cloak is dark, he was born before Christ, I don\u2019t know his name, he has the Hook now, and he\u2019s ready to fight for us!\u201d \\nAnd don\u2019t look now, but the presumptive secretary of the Hook is already making waves. At dawn this morning, he led the Zealots of the Hook in a procession through the streets of Washington, toward the open entrance to the Onyx Pyramid, an edifice by the Lincoln Memorial that residents could not remember ever having existed but that the cloaked man assured Americans in a terse press release \u201chas always been and shall forever be.\u201d \\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: This appointment signals a whole new political era in the nation\u2019s capital. We can\u2019t wait to see how this bold move turns out!'"}, "time": 1742562084.6289942}
