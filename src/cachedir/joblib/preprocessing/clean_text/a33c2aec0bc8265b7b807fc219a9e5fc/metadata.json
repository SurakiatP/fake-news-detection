S. government for poorly storing cyberweapons, which had been leaked from the National Security Agency (NSA). \u201cThe WannaCrypt exploits used in the attack were drawn from the exploits stolen from the National Security Agency, or NSA, in the United States,\u201d Microsoft explained in a statement. \u201cThat theft was publicly reported earlier this year. A month prior, on March 14, Microsoft had released a security update to patch this vulnerability and protect our customers. \u201d \u201cWhile this protected newer Windows systems and computers that had enabled Windows Update to apply this latest update, many computers remained unpatched globally. As a result, hospitals, businesses, governments, and computers at homes were affected,\u201d they claimed. Citing the recent WikiLeaks releases that included leaked code for CIA programs, Microsoft added that \u201cthis attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem,\u201d calling it \u201can emerging pattern in 2017. \u201d \u201cThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a   call,\u201d they expressed, claiming that government agencies \u201cneed to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. \u201d Several journalists, however, claimed in articles that Microsoft was just as responsible for the attack as the U. S. government. \u201cBy failing to support older versions of its operating system, the IT company provided the hackers that stole the NSA\u2019s IT Tomahawk Missile the opportunity they needed,\u201d expressed one writer for the Independent, while the Inquirer voiced similar concerns in an article titled \u201cMicrosoft, it\u2019s not just the NSA. If you want to kill WannaCry, fix broken Windows. \u201d This week, cybersecurity firm Proofpoint warned that a bigger global attack was on the way. \u201cIt uses the hacking tools recently disclosed by the NSA and which have since been fixed by Microsoft in a more stealthy manner and for a different purpose,\u201d said Proofpoint, who discovered the \u201cAdylkuzz\u201d attack. \u201cAs it is silent and doesn\u2019t trouble the user, the Adylkuzz attack is much more profitable for the cyber criminals. \u201d \u201cIt transforms the infected users into unwitting financial supporters of their attackers,\u201d they continued, explaining that Adylkuzz lays low on infected devices and mines the   Monero, before sending the financial gain to the perpetrators.
