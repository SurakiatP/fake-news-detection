[Trump\u2019s gesture was another slight against the    \u201cfree trade\u201d billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who opposed Trump during the Republican primary season and refused to help him during the general election. It also signals Trump will not necessarily play nice with the GOP political establishment and Beltway right.  The Kochs swooped in during the Tea Party revolt in 2010, training amateur political activists and trying to channel populist energy against the Obama administration into supporting the   alliance that wanted more cheap labor and lesser sentences for drug traffickers, under the umbrella term of \u201csmaller government. \u201d But the \u201cgrassroots army  \u2026     was not controllable,\u201d as one former Koch staffer lamented, and the Kochs appeared curiously unwilling to make any concessions to Americans who wanted populist, nationalist policies, and relief from the relentlessly eroding forces of mass immigration and globalization. A majority of voters \u2014   some of whom saw more demographic change take place in their communities than many countries saw in a millennia \u2014  want immigration slashed in half or reduced to zero. Trump captured that energy and it propelled him to the White House, much to the Kochs\u2019 and their network\u2019s chagrin. The Kochs wanted candidates amenable to their will, and Trump didn\u2019t fit the bill. They considered him a distraction before he rocketed to first in the polls, and even toyed with the idea of spending tens of millions of dollars to attack him. Trump mocked the Kochs while on the campaign trail, calling their preferred candidates \u201cpuppets\u201d enacting their donors\u2019 agenda: I really like the Koch Brothers (members of my P. B. Club) but I don\u2019t want their money or anything else from them. Cannot influence Trump!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2015,  I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets?  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2015,  While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida,  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016,  Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the \u201dpuppet\u201d of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016,  I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016,  Koch\u2019s guest: Harry Hurt III, who authored the 1993 book, Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, which stated Ivana Trump accused her   of \u201craping\u201d her in a sworn deposition during their divorce. In a Facebook post published on the same day, Hurt recounted the incident in third person: Donald Trump personally booted the author of an unflattering biography off Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Friday. Harry Hurt III, who penned the 1993 biography, Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, had come to play with billionaire industrialist David. H. Koch, a Trump club member, and two other golfers. Hurt, who has a scratch handicap and plays in colorful knickers, walked over to Trump on the practice range prior to his group\u2019s assigned tee time, only to suffer a tongue lashing from the  . \u201cI said, \u2018Congratulations, sir,\u2019 and shook his hand,\u201d Hurt recalls. \u201cTrump said, \u2018You were rough on me, Harry. Really rough. That shit you wrote. \u2019\u201d Hurt says he looked Trump in the eye, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all true,\u201d to which Trump rejoined, \u201cNot in the way you wrote it. \u201d Among the juicy tidbits in Hurt\u2019s tome was Ivana Trump\u2019s allegation in a sworn deposition that Trump had \u201craped\u201d her during their divorce battle. Trump told Hurt it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to play at the club, and had his security detail escort Hurt, Koch, and their playing partners to the parking lot. \u201cDavid [Koch] was appalled,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cHe branded Trump \u2018petty\u2019 and vulgar.\u2019 We played Emerald Dunes instead, which is a much, much better golf course than Trump International. \u201d Accusing Trump of \u201craping\u201d his ex wife, Ivana Trump, was a false media accusation arising early in the Republican primaries \u2014  and a weapon the Democratic Party planned to use in the general election after Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly and the Daily Beast \u201crushed it on air\u201d and into print, using Hurt\u2019s book, before bothering to check with Ivana about its truth. It backfired spectacularly when Ivana slammed the allegations and endorsed her   for president. \u201c\u201cI have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit,\u201d she said in a July 2015 statement. \u201cDonald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president. \u201d Breathless media coverage of the New Years\u2019 Eve encounter between Trump, Koch, and his guest framed it as Trump having little tolerance for criticism: Nearly every headline focused on the biographer and his critical book, not Koch.
