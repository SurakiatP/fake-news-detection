Civilians, women, and children are being blasted out of existence as two superpowers back opposing sides in a proxy war for regional dominance. Yes, as the Russian fleet nears the Mediterranean Sea, tensions will undoubtedly escalate for a number of nations with ties to the Syrian conflict. \\nBut President Vladimir Putin\u2019s moves regarding Aleppo are far from his only ones worth noting of late. \\nTake Turkey, for instance. Last week, Underground Reporter posited the idea that Turkey, due to its deteriorating relations with the United States and its strengthening cooperation with Russia, has, in effect, become the military wild card in the Middle East. Cited as evidence of deepening Russian-Turkish ties was the fact that the two countries have just signed a deal to build a pipeline from Turkey to Ukraine, which would then supply natural gas to Europe. \\nTurkey, which is north of Syria, shares much of its southern and all of its eastern border with the Mediterranean Sea. A good portion of Syria\u2019s western border also runs into the Mediterranean, and it\u2019s in those waters where Russian vessels, already hovering there, await the arrival of the aircraft carrier-led fleet now pushing through the English Channel. \\nAll this fits nicely into a narrative that only focuses on what\u2019s happening in Aleppo. But one need only glance at a map to see, using nothing but the eyes and common sense, just how much more is actually taking place right now. \\nIn mid-October, it was reported that, for the first time ever, Russia and Egypt would conduct joint military drills. This followed news that Russia will sell attack helicopters to the North African nation and invest billions in Egyptian infrastructure. These items, along with the fact that Egypt is eager to be re-granted Russian tourism rights for its citizens after recent bad blood between the countries, lead one to the logical conclusion that Egypt has every incentive to cooperate with Russia going forward. \\nEgypt, in case you\u2019re not looking at that map, is directly across the Mediterranean Sea from Turkey. \\nThis means when the Russian fleet reaches the Mediterranean \u2014 whether the intent is to park in those waters and bombard Aleppo, as some believe, or merely to project Russian might to the world, as others suggest \u2014 it will be flanked by friendlies on three sides. Turkey to the north, Syrian to the east, and Egypt to the south. \\nThis is not a bad position to be in if you\u2019re looking to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkey to Ukraine. Turkey, incidentally, shares its northern border with the Black Sea, which in turn shares its southern border with Ukraine. And the Black Sea, as those who\u2019ve followed the Ukrainian situation in recent years well know, is swarming with Russian warships. \\nSo, in the bigger picture \u2014 assuming Turkey will eventually fully embrace the Russian sphere and that Egypt, as it\u2019s highly incentivized to do, embraces its new role as a Russian satellite \u2014 Putin has protected himself quite deftly from those in the West who\u2019ll inevitably, no matter what the fleet does once it arrives, accuse Putin of aggression. \\nTurkey and Egypt are both formerly staunch U.S. allies, after all, and there\u2019s been no official severing of ties, or even hintsof such, with those nations. So Putin, thanks largely to the West\u2019s own hegemonic maneuvering, has a lot of room to operate in terms of deals and cooperation \u2014 both militarily and economically. \\nIn any case, the facts present a narrative \u2014 albeit a theoretical one \u2014 that isn\u2019t being discussed. Putin, as we speak, may be implementing the first phases of an effort to secure a nice straight shot from Turkey to Ukraine for the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline.
