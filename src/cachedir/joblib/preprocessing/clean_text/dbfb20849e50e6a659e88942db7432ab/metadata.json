They have taken a process that used to be heavily pollutant and modernized it to create incredible amounts of energy with a low waste output. They\u2019ve even figured out how to turn a lot of that polluting gas into biofuel. \\nCurrently, the Swedish population recycles 1.5 billion bottles and cans annually, which is an amazing amount, relative to the population of about 9.6 million (in 2013). \\nThere are 32 of these amazing reconversion plants, dedicated to turning trash into energy, throughout the country and they are actually at a point where they need to import trash to keep them going. They continue to import trash from the UK, Italy, Norway, and Ireland. \\nBurning it is, now, better for the environment than letting it sit there , says Swedish Waste Management communications director Anna-Carin Gripwell. \u201cWhen waste sits in landfills, leaking methane gas and other greenhouse gasses, it is obviously not good for the environment.\u201d \\n\u201cWe feel that we have responsibility to act responsibly in this area and try to reduce our ecological footprint,\u201d states Per Bolund, Swedish Finance and Consumption Minister. \u201cThe consumers are really showing that the want to make a difference and what we\u2019re trying to do from the government\u2019s side is to help them act, making it easier to behave in a sustainable way.\u201d Vote Up\""}, "time": 1742562054.1173587}
