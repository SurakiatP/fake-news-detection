And I do want to say that I\u2019ve been very vocal for my support for everyone besides Donald Trump. Heavily supported Bernie. Heavily supported Hillary. And I still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president, and that\u2019s what makes me so sad.\u201d \\n\u201cI just wish that she had that opportunity. Because she fought for so long and because I believe her when she says that she loves this country. This is all she\u2019s ever done. She\u2019s given her life to make it better. But, like Donald Trump so ironically played after his speech, it said, \u2018You can\u2019t always get what you want.\u2019 And happy hippies, we adjust and we accept everyone for who they are. And so Donald Trump, I accept you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this hurts to say, but I even accept you as the President of the United States, and that\u2019s fine\u2026because I think now I want to be hopeful.\u201d \\nShe then went on to thank Barack Obama for \u201ceverything he has done the past eight years,\u201d and thanked Hillary \u201cfor inspiring us.\u201d \\nThe video of Miley crying can be seen below: \\nSign up to get breaking news alerts from Dennis Michael Lynch.
