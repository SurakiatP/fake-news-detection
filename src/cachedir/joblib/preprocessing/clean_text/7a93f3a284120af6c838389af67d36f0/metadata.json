{"duration": 0.05128169059753418, "input_args": {"text": "'CNN has published a stinging fact check of the Trump Administration, exposing several falsehoods in a joke that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made Tuesday about salad dressing. [During the afternoon\u2019s White House press briefing, Spicer made a quip about conspiracy theories that U. S. President Donald Trump is an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin  \u2014   recruited via blackmail in 2013  \u2014   and how the professional journalists who believe this conspiracy might add consumption of \u201cRussian dressing\u201d to their pile of circumstantial evidence.  Case closed? Hardly. CNN\u2019s Michelle Krupa dug deep and found that ACKSHUALLY, Russian dressing has no direct connection to the country that hacked our election. Krupa penned a fact check headlined \u201cRussian dressing is actually from Nashua, New Hampshire\u201d: \u201cIf the President puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that\u2019s a Russia connection,\u201d Sean Spicer said. Thing is, Russian dressing isn\u2019t Russian. (Also, it\u2019s really not for salads, but more of a sandwich spread  \u2014   usually a Reuben.) The mayo and ketchup concoction  \u2014   often dressed up with horseradish and spices  \u2014   was created in Nashua, New Hampshire. This is not the first   fact check of Trump or his administration, but it could end up in the hall of fame  \u2014   along with these winners from Krupa\u2019s peers: \u2022 Both CNN and NBC News called BS in the second presidential debate of 2016 after Trump said that Hillary Clinton \u201cacid washed\u201d her email server  \u2014   for, instead of literally washing the device with acid, her tech team merely used a program called \u201cBleachBit\u201d to delete the server\u2019s data. \u2022 The Associated Press \u201cfact checked\u201d Trump\u2019s opinion that actress Meryl Streep is overrated. \u2022 In the inverse of this phenomenon, PolitiFact has called two statements from Trump \u201chalf true\u201d and \u201cmostly false,\u201d even though the articles concede that the claims and numbers he put forward are accurate.'"}, "time": 1742562142.6223896}
