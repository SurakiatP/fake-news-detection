A day after a   panel rebuffed him, Mr. Trump said he might sign \u201ca   order\u201d as early as Monday that would be aimed at accomplishing the same purpose but, presumably, with a stronger legal basis. While he vowed to keep fighting for the original order in court, he indicated that he would not wait for the process to play out to take action. \u201cWe will win that battle,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One as he flew to Florida for a weekend golf outing with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Yet noting that it most likely would not happen quickly, he also raised the possibility of \u201ca lot of other options, including just filing a   order. \u201d Asked if he would do that, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be. \u201d The president\u2019s pivot represented a   tactical retreat even as he insisted that he would prevail in the long run. The battle over his order, which suspended refugee flows and temporarily blocked visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, has come to define Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency both at home and abroad, and has tested his capacity to impose his will on a political and legal system that he has vowed to master but that has resisted his demands. Mr. Trump typically prefers a fight, but drafting a new travel order would acknowledge that sometimes a president must find other ways to proceed. Asked to describe what he had in mind for a new executive order, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have very, very strong vetting. I call it extreme vetting, and we\u2019re going very strong on security. We are going to have people coming to our country that want to be here for good reason. \u201d White House officials denied news reports that the president would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court. \u201cAll options remain on the table,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said by email late Friday. A new version of the executive order would amount to a tacit admission that the administration would not be able to quickly or easily overturn the decision issued on Thursday by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Even some conservative lawyers allied with the White House said there was little chance of prevailing right away with the Supreme Court, which is divided along ideological lines with a seat vacant. Emboldened by the appeals court, Democrats attacked Mr. Trump for trying to subvert American values. \u201cI promise you, we will fight back,\u201d Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in his party\u2019s weekly radio and internet address. \u201cWe will resist. We will resist on behalf of what is American. And we will resist on behalf of the immigrants who came here in the past and who will come here in the future. \u201d Mr. Trump has other ways to soldier on. The Ninth Circuit decision left in place a temporary restraining order blocking the travel order, but did not rule on the underlying constitutional or legal issues of the case. The president could ask the full Ninth Circuit to hear an appeal on the restraining order, or he could return to the lower courts for a battle over the merits, which would take longer to conclude. The administration was still fighting battles in other courts across the nation. Lawyers for the Justice Department were back in court in Alexandria, Va. outside the nation\u2019s capital, arguing against a preliminary injunction that would halt the travel ban from being enforced nationwide. Given multiple challenges, the idea of starting over appealed to the White House. Edward Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and an advocate of Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote on Twitter that it was \u201cutterly crazy\u201d to expect the justices to overturn Thursday\u2019s ruling. As a result, Mr. Whelan wrote, it would be better to develop a \u201csensible\u201d executive order and unveil it \u201cwith clear expectations\u201d for carrying it out. The original executive order issued last month barred refugees from anywhere in the world from entering the United States for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely. It also cut off visitors for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Mr. Trump said he needed time to tighten screening procedures. White House officials could draft a new order that would address some of the concerns raised by the judges. A new order, for instance, could explicitly state that it did not apply to permanent legal residents holding green cards. After some initial crossed signals, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security have said Mr. Trump\u2019s original ban does not affect green card holders, but the appeals court judges pointed out that was not in the text of the order. The White House could also narrow the categories of people affected, or change the list of countries targeted. And it could take out provisions intended to give preference to religious minorities, which in Muslim countries would refer to Christians, among others. Mr. Trump said in a television interview that he wanted to give preference to Christian refugees, but the judges expressed concern about a religious rule that could be discriminatory. Mr. Trump has also argued that the restrictions were necessary to stop terrorists from entering the United States, citing attacks in Europe over the past year. As the United States has struggled with terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, no one has been killed in a terrorist attack on American soil by anyone from one of those seven countries  \u2014   a point noted by the judges  \u2014   although some   attackers from them have been thwarted. The White House could try to offer a stronger rationale for why a temporary ban would actually stop terrorism. In his weekly address, Mr. Trump told Americans he was \u201ccommitted to your security\u201d and would not be deterred by criticism of his order. \u201cWe will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the judiciary have drawn criticism. He initially called a federal district judge in Seattle who first blocked his executive order a \u201c  judge\u201d and said Americans should blame the judge if there were a terrorist attack. When the appeals court took up the case, he said a \u201cbad high school student\u201d would uphold the order. Mr. Trump started Friday with another attack on the appeals court ruling, calling it \u201ca disgraceful decision. \u201d But for much of the rest of the day, he avoided the incendiary language he has been using. At a White House news conference with Mr. Abe before flying to Florida, he said he would fight in court, but did not address the judges. Mr. Trump suggested that he had learned more about the threat of terrorism from intelligence briefings since he took office. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve been president, which is just for a very short period of time, I\u2019ve learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely president,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561974.1815772}
