[The prime minister made his remarks before the reading of the Scroll of Esther at the central synagogue in Caesarea, the Jerusalem Post reported. He turned to the children surrounding him in costumes traditionally worn on Purim and asked them: \u201cWhat is the holiday about, what do we celebrate, what do we remember, what did they try to do to us then?\u201d  Several children replied, \u201cTo kill us. \u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d Netanyahu asked. \u201cIn Persia,\u201d they answered. \u201cDid they succeed?\u201d the prime minister asked. \u201cNo,\u201d one child said, \u201cthe opposite happened. \u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen, the opposite happened,\u201d Netanyahu repeated. \u201cAlso, today they want to destroy us from Persia they will not succeed. \u201d His comment was met with applause from the congregation. On Thursday, Netanyahu compared the Islamic Republic to ancient Persia in his comments to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cI thank you for your good wishes on Purim,\u201d the prime minister told Putin. \u201cSome 2, 500 years ago in ancient Persia, there was an attempt to wipe out the Jews, which did not succeed, and which we commemorate with this holiday. \u201d Today, Netanyahu said, Iran  \u2014   the heir of the Persians  \u2014   has similar designs: to wipe out the state of the Jews. \u201cThey say this clearly, and it is etched on their ballistic missiles,\u201d he said. However, Putin seemed to shoot down the analogy, saying the Purim story took place \u201cin the fifth century B. C. \u201d \u201cWe now live in a different world. Let us talk about that now,\u201d Putin said. In his speech to a special joint session of the U. S. Congress in March 2015, Netanyahu famously evoked the Purim story when explaining the threat posed by the nuclear deal signed by   Barack Obama. \u201cWe\u2019re an ancient people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our nearly 4, 000 years of history, many have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish people. Tomorrow night, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, we\u2019ll read the Book of Esther. We\u2019ll read of a powerful Persian viceroy named Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people some 2, 500 years ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies. The plot was foiled. Our people were saved. \u201d He continued by saying that Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Haman\u2019s   heir, had similar plans for the Jewish nation. \u201cBut I can guarantee you this,\u201d he said, \u201cthe days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies  \u2014   those days are over. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562730.205945}
