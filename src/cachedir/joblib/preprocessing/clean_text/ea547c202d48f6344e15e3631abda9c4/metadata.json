[By Saturday morning, \u201cFooty McFooty Face\u201d had 5, 229 votes, well over four times as many as of the other possible names.  According to 10 News, the other names include \u201cSan Diego Bad Hombres,\u201d \u201cSan Diego Surf,\u201d \u201cMission San Diego FC,\u201d \u201cSan Diego Football Club (SDFC),\u201d and \u201cSan Diego Armada. \u201d Votes can be cast on SoccerCity SD\u2019s Facebook page. There is precedent for Internet voting to go awry in these kinds of situations. For example, in March 2016 the British government decided to let people vote online to name a $287 million \u201cpolar research ship. \u201d The New York Times reports that people \u201cquickly disregarded the more dignified names suggested by the Natural Environment Research Council,\u201d opting instead for \u201cR. R. S. Boaty McBoatface. \u201d The Huffington Post reports that Mountain Dew asked internet voters to \u201cDub the Dew\u201d by choosing a name for a new flavor in 2014. The voting was \u201chijacked\u201d by 4Chan, and the names with the most votes were \u201c\u2018Hitler Did Nothing Wrong,\u2019 \u2018Diabeetus\u2019 [and] \u2018Moist Nugget. \u2019\u201d The voting to name San Diego\u2019s MLS team ends March 31. SoccerCity SD has not said whether it will use \u201cFooty McFooty Face,\u201d if in fact that name wins the internet poll. Ultimately, the British government decided to name the research vessel the RRS Sir David Attenborough, after a popular host of nature programs. It named a submersible research vehicle Boaty McBoatface instead, in a mild tribute to the results of the original popular vote.
