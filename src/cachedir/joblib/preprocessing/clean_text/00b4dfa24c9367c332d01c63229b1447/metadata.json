Trump is a threat to the party\u2019s fortunes and have begun discussing how soon their endangered candidates should explicitly distance themselves from the presidential nominee. For Republicans in close races, top strategists say, the issue is no longer in doubt. One House Republican has already started airing an ad vowing to stand up to Mr. Trump if he is elected president, and others are expected to press similar themes in the weeks ahead. In the world of Republican \u201csuper PACs,\u201d strategists are going even farther: discussing advertisements that would treat Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat as a given and urge voters to send Republicans to Congress as a check on a Hillary Clinton White House. The discussions were described by officials familiar with the deliberations, several of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential planning. For now, some of the party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents are simply hoping to avoid what they see as the taint of association with their  . Two members of Congress locked in competitive races made themselves scarce when Mr. Trump arrived in their states on Friday. The two, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Representative David Young of Iowa, held events elsewhere. Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, in a conference call with reporters the same day, was less subtle. \u201cDonald Trump is in a category unto himself,\u201d Mr. Toomey said, predicting that his state\u2019s voters \u201cwill make a completely separate decision\u201d between the top of the ticket and the Senate campaign this year. That is increasingly the hope of nearly every Republican leader across the country. Mr. Trump\u2019s plunge in polls this week, along with his dual attacks on the family of a fallen American soldier and the leadership of his own party, has convinced veteran Republican strategists that most of their candidates must navigate around the presidential nominee. Plans for ads that distance congressional candidates from the top of the ticket have accelerated. \u201cYou will see them by early to   now,\u201d even before the first debate on Sept. 26, predicted Scott Reed, the senior political strategist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. At a recent conference of Republican donors, Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, warned that even the party\u2019s substantial majority in that chamber might be in jeopardy. \u201cThe conclusion has become that the guy is incorrigible,\u201d said Thomas M. Davis III, a former House member from Virginia who is still close to many of the party\u2019s leaders. \u201cHe\u2019s going to leave our candidates with no choice but to go their own separate way. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but on Friday night he tried to calm angry Republicans by endorsing, belatedly, the   of Mr. Ryan and Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Mr. Trump had been feuding with them after they criticized his ridicule of the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq. Captain Khan\u2019s parents had denounced Mr. Trump during the Democratic National Convention. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, had urged Mr. Trump to stand behind Mr. Ryan and the senators for the sake of party unity. Some leading Republicans have expressed hope that Mr. Trump can at least stabilize his campaign by Labor Day, when many voters begin paying attention to congressional races. But with such an erratic and belligerent candidate leading their ticket, many in the party have long seen a     strategy as inevitable. David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a group that advocates small government, said the organization was studying how to get Republican voters who may dislike Mr. Trump to turn out for the party\u2019s   candidates. Mr. McIntosh said the Club for Growth intended to convince voters that they would need a \u201cstrong voice in the Senate and House,\u201d regardless of their feelings about the presidential race. \u201cYou hope Trump does well so that the base Republican vote comes out and is strong,\u201d Mr. McIntosh said. \u201cBut you also have to plan for if he doesn\u2019t do well. \u201d At the moment, that seems likely. Mrs. Clinton opened a large lead last week in national polls, with a handful showing her leading by double digits. Perhaps more significantly, new surveys indicate that she has staked out leads in states Mr. Trump most likely needs to win the White House, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan, and that she is also close or edging ahead in   states such as Georgia, where at least one poll has her ahead. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advantage may ebb. The surveys were taken soon after the Democratic National Convention and during Mr. Trump\u2019s   week. But Republicans are planning for the worst. Also under consideration is the possibility of a huge ad campaign to promote an agenda of conventional Republican positions, along the lines of economic proposals outlined by Mr. Ryan. The point of such a campaign, one strategist said, would be to provide voters with a different, nonthreatening view of Republicans, so that the party is not wholly defined by Mr. Trump\u2019s    pronouncements. What stops Republicans from disavowing Mr. Trump en masse is that they fear alienating his voters, who may be crucial to the party\u2019s efforts to retain its congressional majorities. In an era in which fewer voters split their tickets, it is important to Republican leaders that Mr. Trump at least run competitively with Mrs. Clinton to avert a   wipeout. \u201cDo we run the risk of depressing our base by repudiating the guy, or do we run the risk of being tarred and feathered by independents for not repudiating him?\u201d asked Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster working on many of this year\u2019s races. \u201cWe\u2019re damned if we do and damned if we don\u2019t. \u201d Republicans currently have a precarious hold on the Senate Democrats would need just four more seats to gain control if Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency, giving the chamber\u2019s tiebreaker vote to her running mate, Tim Kaine. Republicans enjoy a more substantial majority in the House, where Democrats must capture 30 more seats to take control. But Mr. Trump\u2019s difficulties have become so acute that there is rising concern that Republicans could lose enough House seats to loosen Mr. Ryan\u2019s grip and, in subsequent elections, threaten his majority. Speaking in private to a group of donors last week at a political conference in Colorado sponsored by the industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, Mr. Ryan expressed concerns that the House was increasingly at risk, according to a Republican who was present for the conversation. Mr. Ryan implored the donors not to assume that the House was impregnable and not to entirely focus their efforts on retaining the Senate. Among the party\u2019s biggest contributors, there is a growing sense of alarm about defending control of Congress, now that Mr. Trump has proved resistant to correcting course in the general election. Republican donors had hoped that Mr. Trump would shed his practice, from the primary season, of seizing attention with incendiary remarks. Jay Bergman, an Illinois oil executive and major Republican donor, said Mr. Trump\u2019s clash with the parents of a slain soldier had been a sharp reality check. Mr. Bergman said he had previously viewed Mr. Trump as a \u201cloose cannon like a fox\u201d  \u2014   calculating his inflammatory comments to drive his message. That view was harder to sustain after Mr. Trump\u2019s latest eruption, he said. With the presidential race looking so uncertain, Mr. Bergman said he was more focused on protecting the Senate. He said that donors at the   conference had received a bracing presentation about just how difficult the political map was for Republican senators. So far, Mr. Trump has faced disavowal from a modest array of congressional Republicans, nearly all of them dependent on the votes of moderate, suburban voters. In the past week, the campaign of Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado, who represents suburban Denver, began airing a television ad in which he pledges to stand up to Mr. Trump if he becomes president. Other Republicans are expected to follow suit as early as this month. But even that approach may be insufficient. House Republican officials were furious at Mr. Coffman for not being prepared to answer predictable   questions about whether he still supported Mr. Trump. Democrats responded with an advertisement showing photos of Mr. Coffman and Mr. Trump side by side and urging voters to reject them both. Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, the chairman of the House Democratic campaign arm, said his party was aiming to ensure that Republicans would be tarnished by Mr. Trump, even if they distanced themselves from him. \u201cA denouncement of Trump at this point is too little, too late,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n warned. There is precedent for Republicans to ease away from a presidential nominee who appears unable to win. Late in the 1996 campaign, the party ran television ads explicitly urging voters to elect a Republican Senate as a check on President Bill Clinton\u2019s power, even as its challenger, Bob Dole, fought to overcome Mr. Clinton\u2019s lead. Former Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who was the majority leader at the time, said such   measures had been necessary and effective  \u2014   and may be once again. \u201cThere are a lot of people saying we want to save the majority in the House and defend the Senate,\u201d Mr. Lott said. \u201cWhat I would say is: Clinton may be president, and we\u2019re certainly going to need the Senate. And by the way, if Trump is president, he\u2019s certainly going to need the Senate, too. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561741.275003}
