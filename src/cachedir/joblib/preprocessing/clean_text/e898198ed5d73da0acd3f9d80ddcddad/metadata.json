The chief prosecutor in Dijon described the attacks, which left 13 injured but no one dead, as the work of a mentally unbalanced man whose motivations were vague and \u201chardly coherent. \u201d A year and a half later, after Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel slaughtered dozens of people when he drove a   refrigerated truck through a Bastille Day celebration on Thursday in Nice, France, the authorities did not hesitate to call it an act of Islamic terrorism. The attacker had a record of petty crime but no obvious ties to a terrorist group, yet the French prime minister swiftly said Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel was \u201ca terrorist probably linked to radical Islam one way or another. \u201d The age of the Islamic State, in which the tools of terrorism appear increasingly crude and haphazard, has led to a reimagining of the common notion of who is and who is not a terrorist. Instances of wanton violence by deranged attackers  \u2014   whether in Nice or in Orlando, Fla.  \u2014   are swiftly judged to be the work of terrorists. These judgments occur even when there is little immediate evidence that the attackers had direct ties to terrorist groups and when they do not fit a classic definition of terrorists as those who use violence to advance a political agenda. \u201cA lot of this stuff is at the fringes of what we would historically think of as terrorism,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, a former State Department coordinator for counterterrorism and a professor at Dartmouth College. But, he said, \u201cthe Islamic State and jihadism has become a kind of refuge for some unstable people who are at the end of their rope and decide they can redeem their   lives\u201d by dying in the name of a cause. Mr. Benjamin said this also led the news media and government officials to treat violence like the Nice attack differently from other mass attacks, like shootings at schools and churches that have been carried out by  . \u201cIf there is a mass killing and there is a Muslim involved, all of a sudden it is by definition terrorism,\u201d he said. The spectrum of terrorism is widening and now includes attacks loosely inspired by the Islamic State, those carried out by its affiliate groups and attacks directed by the group\u2019s leadership. All have drawn public condemnation and concern, but the plots organized and executed by the Islamic State usually prompt greater concern from the authorities. On Saturday, a bulletin on the Islamic State\u2019s Amaq News Agency channel described Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel as a \u201csoldier of the Islamic State\u201d who answered a call to attack nations involved in the military campaign against the group. But the bulletin gave no specifics about the extent of the attacker\u2019s ties to the terrorist network. On one hand, there is now good reason for government officials to make immediate assumptions after some mass killings that the Islamic State has played a role, however indirect. The group\u2019s ideology, spread widely through social media and slick propaganda videos, appears to have inspired a scourge of violence for more than a year: including the shooting in December in San Bernardino, Calif. the mass killings last month at a gay nightclub in Orlando and the deadly attack early this month at a cafe in Bangladesh. These were in addition to attacks that top Islamic State operatives apparently planned directly, like the Paris assaults in November and the Brussels bombings in March. In September 2014, the spokesman for the Islamic State put out a call for the group\u2019s followers to attack Westerners by any means possible, and to do so without awaiting further instructions from the group\u2019s leaders. \u201cSmash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,\u201d the spokesman, Abu Muhammad   said during a   recorded statement. At the same time, governments also see a benefit in linking the Islamic State to what are sometimes random and unconnected acts of violence. It is a way to project order amid chaos, and to try to assure jittery citizens that there is a strategy to end the violence. For example, in the days since the Nice attack, French officials have pledged to increase the resources that the country is devoting to the bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. \u201cEven if Daesh doesn\u2019t do the organizing, Daesh inspires this terrorist spirit against which we are fighting,\u201d the French defense minister,   Le Drian, said Saturday, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. Similarly, American officials have cited progress in the military campaign as a measure of success in draining the Islamic State\u2019s power, resources and influence. Brett H. McGurk, President Obama\u2019s special envoy in the fight against the Islamic State, recently told Congress that the group had lost 47 percent of its territory in Iraq and 20 percent in Syria: territory used to extract oil from the ground and taxes from residents, as well as to plot attacks against the West. Top representatives of nations participating in the bombing campaign will meet this week in Washington to assess the progress in the fight. But terrorism experts caution that because the Islamic State seems to have broad appeal to the mentally unbalanced, the displaced and others on the fringes of society, there are limits to how much any military campaign in Syria and Iraq can reduce violence carried out in other countries on the group\u2019s behalf. William McCants, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cThe ISIS Apocalypse,\u201d said there was a large cadre of \u201cmen and women who have no organizational ties to ISIS but murder in its name. \u201d These irreligious criminals and social misfits, whom he described as \u201c\u201d are \u201crebels looking for a cause,\u201d he said. During congressional testimony last week, Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, gave a sober assessment of the broad campaign against the Islamic State. \u201cIt is our judgment that ISIL\u2019s ability to carry out terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq and abroad has not to date been significantly diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cEither lone actors or small, insular groups continue to gravitate toward simple tactics that do not require advance skills or outside training,\u201d he said. The murderous   rampage by Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, a Tunisian living in France, is the embodiment of this phenomenon. The authorities in France are still trying to piece together what direct ties, if any, Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel had to the Islamic State. On Saturday, the Islamic State\u2019s Bayan radio station said Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel had used \u201ca new tactic\u201d to wreak havoc. \u201cThe crusader countries know that no matter how much they enforce their security measures and procedures, it will not stop the mujahedeen from striking,\u201d the station said. Such ominous warnings about indiscriminate violence create formidable challenges for world leaders, who must strike a balance of raising awareness about the terrorist threat without gratuitously stoking fears. \u201cAs for how governments can calm their citizens, I\u2019m at a loss,\u201d Mr. McCants said. \u201cEvery attack is discussed endlessly on television and social media, which heightens fear of future attacks, makes citizens scared of one another\u201d and puts pressure on governments to look tough, he said. And, he added, it \u201cgives politicians a cudgel to club their governing opponents when they don\u2019t react strongly enough. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562002.526437}
