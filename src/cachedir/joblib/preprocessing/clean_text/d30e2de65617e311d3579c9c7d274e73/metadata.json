Now, there\u2019s one spin studio that has a brand-new approach to take motivation to the next level. At SpinZone NYC, they\u2019ve got a great new twist to keep riders active and focused the whole 45 minutes: Every one of their bikes is hooked up to a sick child\u2019s life support. \\nToo cool! Where do we sign up??? \\nIf you thought spin class was intense before, just wait until you see this setup. With 16 bikes, each hooked up to the equipment needed to keep one child alive, there\u2019s no doubt that every bit of effort counts\u2014if you stop pedaling, the machines stop, too. Even with the array of pulsing lights and music we\u2019ve come to expect from spin class, the distinct sound of an EKG flatlining on a 7-year-old can be a powerful motivator to let riders know it\u2019s time to step things up. \\nIn an increasingly competitive fitness market, the innovative approach at SpinZone NYC is a breath of fresh air, and it\u2019s winning them new customers left and right. With no backup generators and no excuses, they\u2019ve created exactly the kind of environment people need to get real results. Instructors are always there to offer a word of encouragement and remind cyclists how severe their child\u2019s condition is. And forget about plateauing\u2014once participants make it through a full session with one sick kid, that just means a bigger and sicker child for the next workout. \\n\u201cI used to make it 30 minutes, tops,\u201d said Erika Perry, a regular who says she never breaks eye contact with her kid for extra motivation to keep going. \u201cNow I regularly make it the full class. There\u2019s something about a child depending on me for survival that really gets me going in the morning. And I\u2019ve dropped 11 pounds and feel great!\u201d \\nWow, it sounds like things are off to a great start! If this catches on, it\u2019s exactly the kind of bold idea that can transform an entire industry. Way to go, SpinZone NYC. Keep on pedaling!'"}, "time": 1742628364.909744}
