While ordinary latecomers might try a discreet entrance, bobbing and weaving as they scamper for seats, the constitutionally unmindful Eddy and Patsy stumble onto the catwalk, creating a distraction that forces everyone\u2019s attention on them. What seems like mere    \u2014   Eddy galumphing among the gazelles  \u2014   is a sly declaration of intent in a happily     goof. As it announces, \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous: The Movie\u201d is the   iteration of the BBC series created by Ms. Saunders that enjoyed an erratic run from 1992 to 2012. It\u2019s basically more of the amusing, often very funny, occasionally wincing raucous same, with Eddy and Patsy as the   and    \u2014   and      \u2014   irresistible fools whose adventures are as   as Lucy and Ethel\u2019s were decades earlier. The story this time hangs on Eddy\u2019s efforts to revive her sagging public relations career, a slender narrative thread that Ms. Saunders adorns with bright bits, much like a string of Christmas lights. The original \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d was created by Ms. Saunders and originated in a 1990 skit that she did with her longtime comedy partner Dawn French on their show \u201cFrench and Saunders. \u201d (Ms. Saunders and Ms. French both worked as writers on the \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d series.) Set in the wake of Margaret Thatcher, \u201cAb Fab\u201d  \u2014   as fans fondly call it  \u2014   pivots on Eddy, a child of the 1960s turned hardly working \u201990s businesswoman. Crucially, her time and energy are largely fixed on herself and other women, including her daughter, Saffron, or Saffy (Julia Sawalha) a frump in Dr. Huxtable sweaters and sensible shoes, who plays the superego scold to her mother\u2019s irrepressible id. Nothing if not period appropriate, at least in its early years, the show positioned Eddy and Patsy as avatars of a hilariously clueless, grasping materialism, while riffing on the likes of spiritualism, family life and pop culture. Complexly feminist, it reserved some of its most comically scabrous bits for the preposterous contradictions and hurdles facing women, as in the episode \u201cFat,\u201d in which Eddy obsesses over her weight, vainly struggles to get into her   clothes and aspirationally discusses fasting while nibbling on food. \u201cInside of me there\u2019s a thin person just screaming to get out,\u201d Eddy insists at one point. \u201cJust the one, dear?\u201d asks her mom (June Whitfield). Crucial to the movie and series both is that they lampoon Eddy and Patsy even as they go after the world that made them, which allows you to giggle at the characters and lets them, more or less, have the last   laugh. Their laughter may be   but their unbreakable bond means that at least they\u2019re clueless together. Their friendship remains intact in the movie, as does the show\u2019s principal cast, its   feel, indifferent visuals and gaudy fashion. Except that now the sideshow hits the road, which allows Eddy and her second bananas (including her assistant, Bubble, played by Jane Horrocks) to leave her kitchen for the South of France. Serviceably, at times awkwardly, directed by Mandie Fletcher, the movie skews softer than the series at its barbed best, partly because the celebrity culture that once provided such rich material has become just another ratings opportunity for the Kardashians. As in the series, the perfectly synced Ms. Saunders and Ms. Lumley receive some invaluable support (notably from Kathy Burke, an \u201cAb Fab\u201d veteran) and manage to rise above the crowd of famous faces, which here includes Stella McCartney and Kate Moss. These   function as human versions of Eddy and Patsy\u2019s costly    accessories, which I guess makes Jon Hamm its Birkin bag. \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult companion). Drinking, drugging, shopping. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes.'"}, "time": 1742561968.862118}
