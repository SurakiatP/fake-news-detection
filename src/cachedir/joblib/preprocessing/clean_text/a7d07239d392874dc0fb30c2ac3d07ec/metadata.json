[Nordstrom\u2019s claimed that the Ivanka Trump brand wasn\u2019t performing well, but industry insiders tell Breitbart News that\u2019s just not accurate. Nordstrom\u2019s decision to mislead the public on why they are stopping carrying the Ivanka Trump brand is part of the fury out there among its longtime customers, who tell Breitbart News they\u2019re cutting up their Nordstrom\u2019s cards and won\u2019t shop at the store anymore. Some even say they plan to return all their recent purchases.  \u201cWe\u2019ve said all along we make buying decisions based on performance,\u201d Nordstrom\u2019s press spokesperson told Fortune magazine last week. \u201cIn this case, based on the brand\u2019s performance, we\u2019ve decided not to buy it for this season. \u201d Nordstrom\u2019s had previously taken a neutral approach to boycotters\u2019 calls for the company to discontinue carrying the brand. An internal email sent last November 21 from company   Pete Nordstrom to employees affirmed they would continue carrying the brand, of which he wrote, \u201c[It] has grown to be a sizable and successful business,\u201d according to Fortune. The November email stated their policy on carrying products based on results: \u201cIf people don\u2019t buy it, we won\u2019t sell it. \u201d Nordstrom\u2019s statement went on to state, \u201cWe strive to be agnostic about politics and to treat all our customers with respect. \u201d In response to media reporting on the email, Nordstrom\u2019s told Fortune, \u201cThe email, though meant for an internal audience, captures everything we have to say on this subject. So far we have received many positive responses from our employees. \u201d A Nordstrom representative responded to requests for comment from Breitbart News via email by stating that it will keep selling whatever it has left of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand. \u201cWe\u2019ve offered the brand in different categories and divisions (Shoes, Apparel, Accessories, full price and off price,   and online),\u201d the Nordstrom representative said. \u201cBecause of variations of when previous buys were made, when they\u2019re delivered and how fast they sell through, we\u2019ll continue to have it available for a while. \u201d The representative refused to provide numbers of how many responses there were to the company pulling Trump\u2019s brand after multiple requests. She also stated that there were no plans to reveal whether the responses were more negative or positive. But, in reality, the brand wasn\u2019t performing badly. Nordstrom\u2019s came under political fire from a series of hardcore   activists, according to People Magazine. \u201cThe luxury retailer, which has faced calls for months from the #grabyourwallet movement to drop Ivanka merchandise, said that Nordstrom switches out about 10 percent of its assortment each year to refresh it as a matter of course in running its business, culling lines that aren\u2019t selling well enough,\u201d People\u2019s Stephanie Petit wrote on Wednesday. An industry veteran familiar with Nordstrom\u2019s told Breitbart News that the claim Ivanka\u2019s brand wasn\u2019t performing well is, simply put, not true: This is a classic example of a retailer making a decision based on their fear of standing up to political pressure  \u2014   even on a limited scale. It was clear from their actions since last fall that Nordstrom would prefer to sell out to loud liberal groups who weren\u2019t even regular Nordstrom consumers, just to avoid controversy. It\u2019s sort of amazing that a store which relies on women around the country would fold so quickly to a group with limited reach just to avoid controversy. You would think that Nordstrom would want to stand up for a well known women\u2019s brand whose namesake is a role model for women entrepreneurs, who has consistently supported women\u2019s issues, and represents all of the strength and conviction which women around the country admire. Insiders know how stores can easily play games with placement of merchandise and other ways to lower numbers, and its very possible Nordstrom did that here to cover themselves. It\u2019s amazing that Nordstrom wouldn\u2019t have learned the lesson to be more focused on the entire country and not a limited group of complainers. In fact, the company has been playing politics with   actions for some time now on other matters as well. An overtly political message came across in an internal memo sent last week from Nordstrom\u2019s to its employees, a portion of which spoke to the President\u2019s temporary travel restriction on those coming from seven   nations identified during the Obama Administration. The Seattle PI quoted a portion of the internal Nordstrom\u2019s memo: Last Friday an executive order was signed by the President of the United States related to immigration. This subject is one we\u2019re watching closely  \u2014   our family\u2019s heritage, the company\u2019s roots, and the diverse employees and customers we serve are top of mind. When John W. Nordstrom came to the U. S. as an immigrant, he was given opportunities that allowed him to find a more prosperous and happy life. In so many ways, our humble beginnings and the work ethic and gratitude that goes with it helped shape the culture of our company to this day. Despite efforts by a handful of people to boycott Ivanka Trump\u2019s line, her business manager Abigail Klem told the Guardian last year that the brand has seen \u201csignificant year over year revenue growth. \u201d \u201cWe are proud that our business is growing rapidly and that our brand resonates strongly with women who are inspired by our messaging and excited about the polished and chic   products that we offer,\u201d Klem said. A majority of millennial women, according to a study from BrandKeys highlighted by Forbes last year, are sticking with the Ivanka Trump brand even if they don\u2019t support her father\u2019s policies.   percent of the millennial women surveyed said they were either \u201cextremely likely\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to purchase Ivanka Trump fashion products when asked: \u201cIn light of Ivanka Trump\u2019s involvement with the Trump campaign for president, how likely would you be to consider buying her line of shoes or clothing?\u201d Another 32 percent added they were \u201csomewhat likely,\u201d meaning a total of 83 percent of millennial women still like Ivanka Trump\u2019s line, even when considering her father\u2019s presidential campaign and politics. Only 17 percent said they were \u201cnot very likely\u201d or \u201cnot at all likely\u201d to buy Ivanka Trump products in light of her father\u2019s campaign. BrandKeys surveyed 950 women across nine U. S. census regions between 18 and    from Oct. 21 to Oct. 24, 2016. \u201cEach of the respondents indicated she\u2019d made one or more dress or shoe purchase of at least $250 in the past 12 months,\u201d Forbes magazine\u2019s Clare O\u2019Connor wrote about the poll. What\u2019s more, the targeting of Ivanka Trump and her brand is hardly something that could be considered   activism by its ringleaders.   fanatics have fervently pursued an effectual ban of Trump brands from retailers. Brand strategist and founder of the   Trump boycott Shannon Coulter spearheaded the #grabyourwallet boycott of retailers carrying Trump family brand products according to Business Insider. The report states that the boycott gained steam after the viral Twitter posted letter of someone claiming to be a lifelong Nordstrom customer. \u201cThe hate speech directed at African Americans, Latinos, Jews, Muslims, LGBT people, and women by the Trump campaign is unacceptable and does not seem to represent Nordstrom\u2019s values,\u201d read a portion of the letter. On January 29 the @SheWhoVotes twitter account wrote of Counselor to the President KellyAnne Conway, \u201cWhy does Kellyanne always look like she just emerged from a vat of grease? Or is that just Trump slime?\u201d The account retweeted the tweet on Friday after news of Nordstrom dropping the Ivanka Trump brand. A January 23 tweet from the account called Conway, \u201cSewer Rat Barbie. \u201d Coulter has been tracking availability of Trump\u2019s products on Nordstrom\u2019s website in recent months, according to Business Insider. She claims that in early December, shortly after the November 21 Pete Nordstrom letter to employees saying they would keep the brand, there were 71   items available by last week there were 26, and as of Wednesday there were nine. It is unclear if she had documentation of those numbers. A Friday morning search for \u201cIvanka Trump\u201d did however, return results for just four products. But the negativity from these   activists doesn\u2019t get Ivanka Trump down. She\u2019s standing firm, and emerging from this targeting campaign even stronger. In an interview with Fast Company last October, right before the election, Ivanka Trump stood by her father \u2014  and her brand \u2014  and didn\u2019t flinch. She said the scrutiny and the targeting that has come her way has made her a stronger, tougher woman. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been a year and a half of enormous scrutiny, of my family, every business, every movement, action,\u201d she said. \u201dBut I think that, you know, that sort of comes with the territory. And I think I\u2019ve probably learned a lot through it and I\u2019ve probably grown a bit tougher in terms of my resilience toward what is thrown our way because, you know, I\u2019ve read some very negative stuff. \u201d \u201cI learned a long time ago that I can\u2019t control the opinions of others or what they project on me. All I can do is live my life, and I\u2019ve tried to do that,\u201d she also said in that interview. Ivanka Trump, the daughter of President Donald J. Trump, has since her father\u2019s inauguration stepped back from her roles in not only the Trump organization, but also her own brand as she moved to Washington, D. C. She has been vocal about advocating for improved access to childcare and for women. Her husband Jared Kushner accepted a position as senior advisor to President Trump, and the duo have been integral to President Trump\u2019s early successes. In response to the news about Nordstrom cutting his daughter\u2019s fashion line, President Trump bashed the retail department store on Twitter. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person  \u2014   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017,  In response to Trump\u2019s tweet \u2014  and the ongoing boycott of Nordstrom\u2019s for the company\u2019s political decision to cut Ivanka Trump\u2019s line \u2014  Nordstrom\u2019s stock tumbled on Wednesday. \u201cShares of Nordstrom fell from session highs Wednesday after President Donald Trump said his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had been treated unfairly by the company,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Berkeley Lovelace wrote on Wednesday. Lovelace\u2019s piece notes that Nordstrom\u2019s stock is seriously hurting this year overall, too: \u201cWith Wednesday\u2019s drop, Nordstrom\u2019s shares are down more than 10 percent year to date. \u201d Fueling the fire against Nordstrom\u2019s for the decision to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s line is a boycott from women all across the country. A host of responses on social media showed backlash over the decision, including this exchange in which a Twitter user challenges the company\u2019s claim that the decision was based solely on sales and the company defends its claim: @Nordstrom @beebobaby if it\u2019s not political then why are these liberal loons at #GrabYourWallet taking credit for you dropping Ivanka? Huh?  \u2014   RockPrincess (@Rockprincess818) February 4, 2017,  @Rockprincess818 We can confirm this decision was based on the brand\u2019s performance.  \u2014   Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 4, 2017,  @Nordstrom @Rockprincess818 Nordstrom hold on ur statement doesn\u2019t match up 2 statement from Ivanka Trump\u2019s co. statement they have proof,  \u2014   4reallyandtruly (@4ReallyandTruly) February 4, 2017,  @4ReallyandTruly Because of variations in when previous buys were made, we\u2019ll continue to have it available for a while.  \u2014   Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 4, 2017,  @Nordstrom It\u2019s not available online correct? So where is it available?  \u2014   4reallyandtruly (@4ReallyandTruly) February 4, 2017,  @4ReallyandTruly You may see some items still available in our stores as they sell through the current season\u2019s merchandise.  \u2014   Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 4, 2017,  @Nordstrom Why not online?  \u2014   4reallyandtruly (@4ReallyandTruly) February 4, 2017,  @4ReallyandTruly  You\u2019ll be able to see online inventory as long as we have it in stock.  \u2014   Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 4, 2017,  An attempt to place a particular size and type of Ivanka Trump shoe in an online purchase cart on Nordstrom\u2019s website as of Friday showed that shoe out of stock however, a check of stores revealed that the shoe was in stock in a Nordstrom retail location. Facebook user Shari Bartel Dresselhaus posted a letter to Nordstrom from her niece, a former Nordstrom employee and loyal customer. The letter called out Nordstrom, noting a social media post, \u201c  \u2026    after seeing a post by Olivia Kim whom I recall to be one of your corporate leaders writing #yeswecan #yeswedid below a screenshot of the news article indicating the separation from the Ivanka Trump brand, I am left feeling that this decision was not made purely based on sales performance. \u201d #yeswecan #yeswedid @ Nordstrom https:  .   \u2014   olivia kim (@OliviaKim) February 3, 2017,  Many women nationwide have told Breitbart News as well that they plan to stop shopping at Nordstrom\u2019s. \u201cI will stop patronizing their stores, after 30 years of loyalty, until they stop caving in to the left looneys!\u201d Gay Moreno, who lives in Crossville, Tennessee, told Breitbart News. \u201cPolitical beliefs are one thing weakness in the face of anarchy is another!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of the pompous snobbery of the left and that it seeps through to our retail industry shows me a total lack of respect for the consumer and the patrons,\u201d Wendy Burdette from Clifton, Virginia, said in an email. She said she plans to \u201cshred\u201d her Nordstrom\u2019s card because he doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it anymore. \u201cI will be calling Nordstrom and canceling my credit card after 20 plus years of patronage due to their dropping of the Ivanka Trump line,\u201d Laura Lightstone from Gaithersburg, Maryland, told Breitbart News. \u201cI will also be returning the items I just bought from them last week. I am willing to make a statement in a piece you are writing. \u201d \u201cI have been a frequent shopper at Nordstrom with their credit card but will destroy the card if they do in fact discontinue the Ivanka line,\u201d Sandy Dominick from Fairfax, Virginia \u2014  originally from Canton, Ohio \u2014  said in an email. \u201cVery tired of sore losers. I was very unhappy for past 7 years (note: I gave Obama a year) but never behaved like a spoiled brat. \u201d Deb Chandler, a public relations executive in Washington, D. C. who describes herself as a moderate Republican raised by Southern Democrats, told Breitbart News she\u2019s now boycotting Nordstrom\u2019s over this decision: As a moderate Republican, raised by southern Democrats (Louisiana and Texas,) a child of military veterans, a business owner, and a woman, whose favorite pair of heels happens to be a golden brushed leather pump with a sassy bow by Ivanka Trump, I question where I am in the ongoing transition happening in America. Seriously, has my life come down to a pair of pumps? Yes, apparently so. I am disheartened to find this week, alongside riots and fires at Berkley in an effort to stop free speech, that Nordstrom decided to pull the Ivanka Trump lines from their stores. \u201cFor crying out loud people, I have the right to chose my brand and where I buy my shoes from without a major campaign directing how I spend my hard earned money,\u201d Chandler added. Andrea Lafferty, a conservative leader who is also the president of the group Women for a Great America, told Breitbart News she is done with Nordstrom\u2019s too. \u201cNordstrom\u2019s needs to figure out that their demographic is Christian women not snotty hoodlums wearing masks,\u201d Lafferty said. Lynda DiPasquale, a New Jersey Nordstrom\u2019s shopper, cut up her card over this. \u201cI just cut up my Nordstrom platinum card as I refuse to waste thousands of dollars to support a company that mixes their politics with my fine shopping experience,\u201d DiPasquale said in an email. \u201cOn the bright side  \u2026    my husband will be THRILLED. \u201d Lee O\u2019Connor, another woman who used to shop at Nordstrom\u2019s, won\u2019t anymore. \u201cStore credit cards are an unnecessary nuisance, so I don\u2019t have a Nordstrom\u2019s card to shred,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cBut I won\u2019t be spending any of my   dollars at Nordstrom\u2019s or any other store that caves to pressure from the Left to stop carrying the beautiful and affordable items in the Ivanka Trump Collection. \u201d So is Kelley Pinzon, another previously loyal Nordstrom\u2019s shopper. \u201cAfter 28 years of customer loyalty, I will shred my Nordstrom card by the end of the week if y\u2019all do not start selling Ivanka Trump products again,\u201d Pinzon said in an email. \u201cPlease stop selling political messages and sell merchandise. I want to see Ivanka\u2019s line restored. \u201d And it\u2019s not just women boycotting Nordstrom\u2019s now: Brad Botwin, a previous shopper at the department store chain who is from Rockville, Maryland, told Breitbart News he\u2019s done with them too. \u201cI am a long time Nordstrom customer and exclusively purchase my suits, shirts and ties at Nordstrom,\u201d Botwin said in an email. \u201cNo longer because of their punitive and political act to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line. I have also   Nordstrom to drop me from their special email list of events and other messages. If this organization doesn\u2019t have the backbone to stand up to the unfair left wing pressure against Ivanka Trump, I shudder to think what next they will cave on next. Decisions like this erode the freedoms and liberty of all Americans. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628437.7345705}
