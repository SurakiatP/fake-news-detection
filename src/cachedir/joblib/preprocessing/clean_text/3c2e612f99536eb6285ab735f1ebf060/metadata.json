There was little conflict or   as both men chided the political left for avoiding or drowning out Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s views rather than engaging with them. Introducing Mr. Yiannopoulos, 32, an openly gay editor at Breitbart News, Mr. Maher said: \u201cI think you\u2019re colossally wrong on a number of things. But if I banned everyone from my show who I thought was colossally wrong, I would be talking to myself. \u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos began the interview by cracking jokes about gay people (whom he said he did not hire because they did not show up to work on time) and women, and telling Mr. Maher\u2019s audience that they were \u201cvery easily triggered. \u201d \u201cAll I care about is free speech and free expression,\u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos explained. \u201cI want people to be able to be, do and say anything. These days, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s a conservative issue. \u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos had been scheduled to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month, on an invitation from the school\u2019s College Republicans group. But his talk was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused about $100, 000 in damages. In January, when Mr. Yiannopoulos gave a lecture in Seattle at the University of Washington, a man was shot during protests outside the site of the speech. He spoke in December at the University of   where he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks. When it was announced on Wednesday that Mr. Yiannopoulos would be interviewed on \u201cReal Time,\u201d another scheduled guest, Jeremy Scahill, a journalist for The Intercept, said in a statement on his Twitter account that he was withdrawing from the show. \u201cHe has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,\u201d Mr. Scahill said. \u201cThere is no value in \u2018debating\u2019 him. \u201d Mr. Maher followed with his own statement that said, \u201cIf Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims  \u2014   and he might be  \u2014   nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night. \u201d In the interview on Friday night, Mr. Yiannopolous criticized female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, and he described the Democrats as \u201cthe party of Lena Dunham,\u201d the creator and star of \u201cGirls. \u201d (Mr. Maher replied: \u201cLet\u2019s not pick on fellow HBO stars. There are so many other people. \u201d) Describing himself as \u201ca virtuous troll,\u201d Mr. Yiannopolous said, \u201cI hurt people for a reason. \u201d He said people \u201cwant to police humor\u201d because \u201cthey can\u2019t control it. \u201d \u201cBecause the one thing that authoritarians hate is the sound of laughter,\u201d Mr. Yiannopolous said. Mr. Maher added, \u201cAnd also, because when people laugh, they know it\u2019s true. \u201d Mr. Yiannopolous replied, \u201cNothing annoys people, or amuses people, like the truth. \u201d They then discussed an incident from last summer, when Mr. Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live. \u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t understand, like, the \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 thing,\u201d Mr. Maher said. Mr. Yiannopoulos answered: \u201cI wrote a bad review of a movie. Am I not entitled to do that?\u201d After repeating some of the insults he had leveled at Ms. Jones, he said, \u201cI simply don\u2019t accept  \u2014   I do not accept  \u2014   that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster, that an     is crying over mean words on the internet. Get over it. \u201d \u201cWhat actually hurts people is, like, murder, violence,\u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos added. \u201cThat kind of stuff. \u201d He added that \u201cmean words\u201d don\u2019t \u201churt people. \u201d Mr. Maher said, \u201cWhich some people would say you have incited. \u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos reacted with surprise. \u201cWhat? How?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, some people would say,\u201d Mr. Maher answered. Mr. Yiannopoulos replied, \u201cWell, they would be idiots. \u201d Speaking to his audience, Mr. Maher said, \u201cStop taking the bait, liberals,\u201d and asked how they could be afraid of someone he described as \u201clittle, British, impish\u201d and a slur for gay people. The two men shook hands, and Mr. Maher moved on to his panel discussion. But in an   segment that ran after the HBO broadcast, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that transgender people were \u201cvastly disproportionately involved in sex crime,\u201d drawing jeers, boos and a shout of \u201cliar\u201d from Mr. Maher\u2019s audience. Mr. Yiannopoulos also clashed with the comedian Larry Wilmore, another guest on the show. In remarks to Mr. Yiannopoulos that were bookended by an obscene phrase, Mr. Wilmore took offense at his Twitter trolling of Ms. Jones. \u201cShe\u2019s a very thoughtful person and very funny,\u201d he said. Trying to defuse the tension, Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldn\u2019t be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. \u201cThis is the beginning of your career,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cPeople are only just starting to hate you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561977.9436905}
