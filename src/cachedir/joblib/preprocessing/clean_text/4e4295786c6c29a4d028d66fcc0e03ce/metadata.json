But don\\'t take our word for it, look no further than the unofficial Trump campaign arm Breitbart.com for evidence . As Trump said in September 2015: \\nScott Pelley: Universal health care. \\nDonald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now. \\nIn 1999, Trump was perfectly clear , as reported by Newsmax: \\n\u201cI said I\u2019m conservative, generally speaking, I\u2019m conservative, and even very conservative,\u201d Trump told King in response to a question about a \u201cpatients\\' bill of rights,\u201d reports BuzzFeed. \\n\u201cBut I\u2019m quite liberal and getting much more liberal on healthcare and other things. I really say: What\u2019s the purpose of a country if you\u2019re not going to have defensive and healthcare?\u201d he told King. \"If you can\u2019t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it\u2019s all over. I mean, it\u2019s no good. \\n\u201cSo I\u2019m very liberal when it comes to healthcare. I believe in universal healthcare. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.\u201d \\nAfter Obamacare passed, Trump sat down for an interview on HLN. This is what he had to say, as noted by The Washington Examiner: \\n\u201cNumber one, as a human being, I like to see people \u2014 it\\'s inconceivable that, you know, people are sick, like you get sick, or I get sick, or the kids get sick, and you bring \\'em to a doctor, inconceivable that, you know, 31 or 33 million people can\\'t do that,\u201d Trump told host Joy Behar. \u201cSo on one level, I think something had to be done.\u201d \\nTrump continued, saying the law is \u201creally going to cost a lot of money in terms of competitiveness with this country\u201d and said it would cost a friend\\'s company \u201cover $200 million a year.\u201d \\nHere is what Trump recently tweeted: Obamacare is a disaster - as I\\'ve been saying from the beginning. Time to repeal & replace! #ObamacareFail pic.twitter.com/5CvoMbVceT \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \\nDid Trump say it was a \u201cdisaster from the beginning,\u201d or \u201con one level, I think something had to be done\u201d? \\nPerhaps, we turn to another tweet he had, drawing on the popular hashtag #ObamaCareInThreeWords: REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \\nIt turns out that Donald Trump is a fan of \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d but his political track record before he ran for president as a Republican shows that what he means by that is \u201csingle-payer\u201d\u2014the goal of the Obamacare architect all along. \\nWhen it comes to Trump\\'s solution for Obamacare\u2014making it more competitive for insurance companies\u2014this runs antithetical to the goal of single-payer, which is the government (i.e. taxpayers) paying for everyone. \\nOne can draw their own conclusions about what Trump actually means right now, because no one can be one hundred percent sure. Yet for a man who styled himself as an outsider and not at all like a \u201cpolitician,\u201d his statements on Obamacare show himself very much to be similar to one. '"}, "time": 1742562254.7937129}
