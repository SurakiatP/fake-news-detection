[At a commencement ceremony for students of Computer Science, Newsom warned an audience that the \u201cplumbing of the world is radically changing. \u201d  \u201cThe tech industry that would make them rich, Newsom declared, was also rendering millions of other people\u2019s jobs obsolete and fueling enormous disparities in wealth,\u201d reported The Guardian. \u201c\u2018Your job is to exercise your moral authority,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is to do the kinds of things in life that can\u2019t be downloaded.\u2019 \u201cThat is not the kind of message computer engineers tend to hear. But Newsom, who has been waiting in the wings as California\u2019s lieutenant governor for the past seven years, has put the consequences of automation at the center of his campaign,\u201d they continued. During an interview with The Guardian following his speech, Newsom called the increasing dependency on technology \u201ccode red, a firehose, a tsunami that\u2019s coming our way. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to get rolled over unless we get ahead of this,\u201d he declared. Newsom, however, considers some of the top technology leaders as friends, including Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in and around this world. I could tell you 10 founders who I did their weddings, quite literally married them,\u201d he claimed. \u201cVery, very close a number of them are godparents to my kids. \u201d He is also \u201cnot opposed\u201d to the popular Silicon Valley policy of a universal income. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to figure it out,\u201d Newsom proclaimed during his interview. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have the damn answer. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
