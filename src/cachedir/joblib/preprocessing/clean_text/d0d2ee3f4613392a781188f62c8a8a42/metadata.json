Y. He was 88. His personal assistant, Jakob Holder, confirmed the death. Mr. Holder said he had died after a short illness. Mr. Albee\u2019s career began after the death of Eugene O\u2019Neill and after Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams had produced most of their   plays. From them he inherited the torch of American drama, carrying it through the era of Tony Kushner and \u201cAngels in America\u201d August Wilson and his Pittsburgh cycle and into the 21st century. He introduced himself suddenly and with a bang, in 1959, when his first produced play, \u201cThe Zoo Story,\u201d opened in Berlin on a double bill with Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u201cKrapp\u2019s Last Tape. \u201d A     that unfolds in real time, \u201cThe Zoo Story\u201d zeroed in on the existential terror at the heart of   complacency, presenting the increasingly menacing intrusion of a probing, querying stranger on a man reading on a Central Park bench. When the play came to the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village the next year, it helped propel the blossoming theater movement that became known as Off Broadway. Mr. Albee\u2019s Broadway debut, \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d the famously scabrous portrait of a withered marriage, won a Tony Award in 1963 for best play, ran for more than a year and half and enthralled and shocked theatergoers with its depiction of stifling academia and of a couple whose relationship has been corroded by dashed hopes, wounding recriminations and drink. The 1966 film adaptation, directed by Mike Nichols and starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, turned the play into Mr. Albee\u2019s most famous work it had, he wrote three decades later, \u201chung about my neck like a shining medal of some sort  \u2014   really nice but a trifle onerous. \u201d But it stands as representative, too, an early example of the heightened naturalism he often ventured into, an expression of the viewpoint that   is a universal, urgent, irresistible and poisonous agent in modern life  \u2014   \u201cThere\u2019s nobody doesn\u2019t want something,\u201d as one of his characters said  \u2014   that Mr. Albee would illustrate again and again with characteristically pointed eloquence. A   later, Mr. Albee\u2019s audacious drama about a love affair between man and beast, \u201cThe Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?\u201d won another Tony, ran for nearly a year and staved off the critical despair, however briefly, that the commercial theater could no longer support serious drama. In between, Mr. Albee (his name is pronounced ) turned out a parade of works, 30 or so in all, generally focused on exposing the darkest secrets of relatively    people, with lacerating portrayals of familial relations, social intercourse and individual  . As Ben Brantley of The New York Times once wrote, \u201cMr. Albee has unsparingly considered subjects outside the average theatergoer\u2019s comfort zone: the capacity for sadism and violence within American society the fluidness of human identity the dangerous irrationality of sexual attraction and, always, the irrefutable presence of death. \u201d His work could be difficult to absorb, not only   but elliptical or opaque, and his relationships with   who only intermittently made his plays into hits, and critics, who were disdainful as often as they were laudatory, ran hot and cold. In 1965, after \u201cTiny Alice,\u201d his drama about Christian faith, money and the ethics of worship opened on Broadway, causing much consternation and even outrage among critics who had failed to discern meaning in its murky symbols and suggestions of mysticism, Mr. Albee attended anews conference ostensibly to discuss the play but ended up lecturing on the subject of criticism. \u201cIt is not enough for a critic to tell his audience how well a play succeeds in its intention,\u201d he said \u201che must also judge that intention by the absolute standards of the theater as an art form. \u201d He added that when critics perform only the first function, they leave the impression that less ambitious plays are better ones because they come closer to achieving their ambitions. \u201cWell, perhaps they are better plays to their audience,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are not better plays for their audience. And since the critic fashions the audience taste, whether he intends to or not, he succeeds each season in merely lowering it. \u201d Several of his plays opened abroad before they did in the United States, and his work was often more enthusiastically welcomed in Europe than it was at home even some of his most critically admired plays never found the wider audiences that only a Broadway imprimatur can attract. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a European playwright and I don\u2019t know it,\u201d he said in an interview with The Times in 1991, adding: \u201cJust look at the playwrights who are not performed on Broadway now: Sophocles, Aristophanes, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Moli\u00e8re, Ibsen, Chekhov, Pirandello, Beckett, Genet. Not a one of them. \u201d A clever speaker in interviews with a vivid sense of mischief and the   presumption of an artist, Mr. Albee was wont to confront slights rather than dismiss them, wielding his smooth, sardonic wit as a verbal  . \u201cIf Attila the Hun were alive today, he\u2019d be a drama critic,\u201d he said in 1988. Referring to the \u201chysterical,    \u201d of critics after his 1983 play \u201cThe Man Who Had Three Arms\u201d opened (and quickly closed) on Broadway, he said: \u201cYou\u2019d have thought it was women seeing mice climb up their legs. \u201d And yet he was among the most honored of American dramatists. Beyond his Tonys  \u2014   including one for lifetime achievement  \u2014   he won three Pulitzer Prizes. His major works included \u201cA Delicate Balance,\u201d a   darkly unsettling comedy about an affluent family whose members reveal their deep unhappiness in shrewd and stinging verbal combat \u201cAll Over\u201d (1971) directed on Broadway by John Gielgud and starring Colleen Dewhurst, about a family (and a mistress) awaiting the deathbed expiration of an unseen, wealthy man \u201cSeascape\u201d (1975) another Pulitzer winner, a creepily comic, slightly ominous meditation on monogamy, evolution and mortality that develops from an oceanside discussion involving an elderly human couple and a pair of anthropomorphic lizards and \u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d a strikingly personal work drawn from memories of his adoptive mother, scrutinizing, in its various stages, the life of a dying woman. The play had its 1991 premiere in Vienna but earned Mr. Albee a third Pulitzer after it appeared Off Broadway in 1994. A subsequent work, \u201cThe Play About the Baby,\u201d opened in London in 1998 and in Houston in 2000 before finding its way the next year to Off Broadway in New York. In it Mr. Albee revisited, in a more abstract form of harrowing comedy, notable rudiments of \u201cVirginia Woolf,\u201d namely an older couple initiating a younger couple into the grim realities of later life and a child whose existence becomes a matter of ardent and   discourse. \u201cAlbee is not a fan of mankind,\u201d the critic John Lahr wrote in The New Yorker in 2012. \u201cThe friendships he stages are loose affiliations that serve mostly as a bulwark against meaninglessness. \u201d Mr. Albee explained himself as a kind of herald, perhaps a modern Cassandra warning the theatergoer of inevitable personal calamity. \u201cAll of my plays are about people missing the boat, closing down too young, coming to the end of their lives with regret at things not done, as opposed to things done,\u201d he said in the 1991 Times interview. \u201cI find most people spend too much time living as if they\u2019re never going to die. \u201d He wrote, he said, with a sense of responsibility \u201cAll plays, if they\u2019re any good, are constructed as correctives,\u201d he told The Guardian in 2004. \u201cThat\u2019s the job of the writer. Holding that mirror up to people. We\u2019re not merely decorative, pleasant and safe. \u201d Mr. Albee was born somewhere in Virginia on March 12, 1928. Little is known about his father. His mother\u2019s name was Louise Harvey she called him Edward. In the 1999 biography, \u201cEdward Albee: A Singular Journey,\u201d the author, Mel Gussow, a former reporter and critic for The Times, cited adoption papers  \u2014   filed in Washington within days of his birth  \u2014   that said the father \u201chad deserted and abandoned both the mother and the child and had in no way contributed to the support of the child. \u201d Sent to an adoption nursery in Manhattan before he was three weeks old, baby Edward was placed with Reed Albee, an heir to the   chain of vaudeville theaters, and his wife, Frances, who lived in Larchmont, N. Y. The couple had no children and formally adopted Edward 10 months later, naming him Edward Franklin Albee III after two of his adoptive father\u2019s ancestors. Patrician and distant, the Albees were unsuited to dealing with a child of artistic temperament, and in later years Mr. Albee would often recall an   childhood in which he felt like an interloper in their home. In a 2011 interview at the Arena Stage in Washington with the director Molly Smith, he said that his mother had thrown out his first play  \u2014   he described it as \u201ca   sex farce\u201d  \u2014   which he wrote at age 14. \u201cI think they wanted somebody who would be a corporate thug of some sort, or perhaps a doctor or lawyer or something respectable,\u201d he told the television interviewer Charlie Rose. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want a writer on their hands. Good God, no. \u201d In interviews he said he knew he was gay by the time he was 8, that he began writing poetry at 9, that he had his first homosexual experience at 12 and that he wrote a pair of novels in his teens  \u2014   \u201cthe worst novels that could ever be written by an American teenager. \u201d His education was a hopscotch tour of the middle Atlantic: He attended Rye Country Day School in Westchester County, N. Y. the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, the Valley Forge Military Academy in Pennsylvania and finally the Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Connecticut, from which he graduated. He attended Trinity College in Hartford but never finished, reportedly because he refused to go to chapel and was expelled. Then, in 1949, he moved to Greenwich Village, where his artistic life began in earnest. His circle, made up of painters, writers and musicians, included the playwright William Inge and the composers David Diamond, Aaron Copland and William Flanagan, who became his lover. The Off Broadway theater was nascent, and he began attending plays in the Village  \u2014   \u201cYou could go to the theater for a dollar!\u201d he recalled  \u2014   seeing the works of Beckett, Ionesco, Pirandello and Brecht and supporting himself with menial jobs. His own writing was less than successful  \u2014   he tried short stories and gave them up  \u2014   and though he published a handful of poems, he gave that up, too, when he was 26, because, as he put it to Ms. Smith, \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Edward, you\u2019re getting better as a poet, but the problem is you don\u2019t really feel like a poet, do you? You feel like someone who is writing poetry. \u201d He added: \u201cI knew I was a writer and had failed basically at all other branches of writing, but I was still a writer. So I did the only thing I had not done. I wrote a play. It was called \u2018The Zoo Story.\u2019 \u201d It was a month before his 30th birthday, Mr. Gussow wrote in his biography, that Mr. Albee sat down at a typewriter borrowed from the Western Union office where he worked as a messenger, and completed \u201cThe Zoo Story\u201d in two and a half weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the zoo,\u201d the character Jerry says, in the opening line, approaching Peter, who is sitting on a bench reading. \u201cI said I\u2019ve been to the zoo. Mister, I\u2019ve been to the zoo!\u201d Mr. Diamond helped arrange the Berlin production  \u2014   in German translation (\u201cDie  \u201d)  \u2014   and it was  . But in New York the play was rejected several times before the Actors Studio agreed to stage a single performance afterward, Norman Mailer, who was in the audience, declared it \u201cthe best   play I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201d When \u201cThe Zoo Story\u201d opened for a commercial run at the Provincetown Playhouse in January 1960, reviews were mixed. (The Times\u2019s Brooks Atkinson called it \u201cconsistently interesting and illuminating  \u2014   odd and pithy,\u201d though he concluded that \u201cnothing of enduring value is said. \u201d) Even so, the play made enough of a splash that Mr. Albee became known as an exemplar of a new,   strain of playwriting. In an article in The Times with the headline \u201cDramatists Deny Nihilistic Trend,\u201d Mr. Albee espoused the view that would become his credo: that theatergoers should be challenged to confront situations and ideas that lie outside their comfort zones. \u201cI want the audience to run out of the theater  \u2014   but to come back and see the play again,\u201d he said. His next three plays, also   were also successes Off Broadway: \u201cThe Sandbox\u201d and \u201cThe American Dream\u201d were portraits of family dynamics etched in acid, and \u201cThe Death of Bessie Smith,\u201d which bordered on uncharacteristic agitprop, was about an incident (later revealed to be untrue) in which the great blues singer of the title, who died after an auto accident, had been turned away from a   hospital. Then came \u201cVirginia Woolf. \u201d Focusing on George and Martha, an embittered academic couple  \u2014   he\u2019s a history professor, she\u2019s the college president\u2019s daughter  \u2014   it presents a boozy   encounter between them and two campus newcomers, Nick and Honey, a young biology teacher and his wife, which devolves into a series of horrifying, macabre psychological games, cruel challenges and spilled secrets. The reactions were virulent and disparate. Some critics were appalled: \u201cA sick play for sick people,\u201d The Daily Mirror declared. \u201cThree and a half hours long, four characters wide and a cesspool deep,\u201d said The Daily News. But others were mesmerized and dazzled. A jury awarded it the Pulitzer Prize, but the Pulitzer advisory board rejected the recommendation, choosing not to give an award for drama that year the jurors resigned in protest. In the years since, as the play has grown to become a classic of modern drama and been revived on Broadway three times, most recently in 2012 with Tracy Letts and Amy Morton as George and Martha, it has continued to incite controversy. Some critics and directors interpreted the play as being about four homosexual men, a suggestion that distressed Mr. Albee enough to seek legal remedies to shut down productions of the play with   casts. As for the title, another item of speculation, Mr. Albee explained its origin in an interview in The Paris Review in 1966: \u201cThere was a saloon  \u2014   it\u2019s changed its name now  \u2014   on Tenth Street, between Greenwich Avenue and Waverly Place, that was called something at one time, now called something else, and they had a big mirror on the downstairs bar in this saloon where people used to scrawl graffiti. At one point back in about 1953   \u2026     1954, I think it was  \u2014   long before any of us started doing much of anything  \u2014   I was in there having a beer one night, and I saw \u2018Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u2019 scrawled in soap, I suppose, on this mirror. When I started to write the play it cropped up in my mind again. And of course, who\u2019s afraid of Virginia Woolf means who\u2019s afraid of the big bad wolf, who\u2019s   \u2026     afraid of living life without false illusions. And it did strike me as being a rather typical university, intellectual joke. \u201d Mr. Albee\u2019s other plays include adaptations of the Carson McCullers novella \u201cThe Ballad of the Sad Cafe\u201d of \u201cMalcolm,\u201d a novel by James Purdy, and of Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s great novel of sexual obsession, \u201cLolita. \u201d He was also involved in one of the great flops in Broadway history, becoming a script doctor for the producer David Merrick\u2019s 1966 staging of the musical adaptation of Truman Capote\u2019s novel \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d which starred Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain and closed on Broadway before it opened, after its fourth preview. Mr. Albee was especially productive through the 1960s and early \u201970s, when he was working as a team with the producers Richard Barr and Clinton Wilder. But following his early successes, ending with \u201cSeascape\u201d in 1975, he went into a decline, partly owing to struggles with alcohol, and for nearly 20 years he did not write a commercially successful play. \u201cThe Lady from Dubuque\u201d (1980) a drama concerned with the nature of identity and shadowed by the specter of death  \u2014   it opens with a game of 20 questions, one of whose participants is terminally ill  \u2014   was savaged by the critics and closed after 12 performances on Broadway. A similar fate befell \u201cThe Man Who Had Three Arms\u201d (1983) a bilious discourse on the wages of evanescent celebrity. Mr. Albee lived for several decades in a TriBeCa loft filled with African sculptures and contemporary paintings by the likes of Vuillard, Milton Avery and Kandinsky. His partner of 35 years, Jonathan Thomas, a sculptor, died in 2005. Mr. Albee leaves no immediate survivors. It was \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d in the early 1990s that returned Mr. Albee to prominence, and for the next 20 years he continued to be productive, turning out provocative work, including \u201cThe Goat\u201d and \u201cThe Play About the Baby,\u201d and witnessing (or directing himself) revivals of earlier plays on Broadway and in regional theaters. He was riding this sunset success  \u2014   and continuing to write  \u2014   when he spoke to Ms. Smith in front of an audience at the Arena Stage in Washington, which was then presenting a festival of his work that included readings and performances of more than 20 plays. He recalled the feeling he had at the very beginning of his career, after he had finished writing \u201cThe Zoo Story. \u201d \u201cFor the first time in my life when I wrote that play, I realized I had written something that wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018You know, Edward, this is pretty good. This is talented. Maybe you\u2019re a playwright.\u2019 So I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s find out what happens.\u2019 \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628560.692799}
