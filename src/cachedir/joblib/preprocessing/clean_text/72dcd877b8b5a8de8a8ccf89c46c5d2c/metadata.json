My original tape recordings of the diary and other materials related to the Nixon impeachment provided the basis for my prior book, Without Honor, and are now available for inspection in the George Washington University Library. \\nAfter President Nixon\u2019s resignation, a young lawyer, who shared an office with Hillary, confided in me that he was dismayed by her erroneous legal opinions and efforts to deny Nixon representation by counsel\u2014as well as an unwillingness to investigate Nixon. In my diary of August 12, 1974 I noted the following: \\nJohn Labovitz apologized to me for the fact that months ago he and Hillary had lied to me [to conceal rules changes and dilatory tactics]. Labovitz said, \u2018That came from Yale.\u2019 I said, \u2018You mean Burke Marshall\u2019 [Senator Ted Kennedy\u2019s chief political strategist, with whom Hillary regularly consulted in violation of House rules.] Labovitz said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 His apology was significant to me, not because it was a revelation but because of his contrition. \\nAt that time Hillary Rodham was 27 years old. She had obtained a position on our committee staff through the political patronage of her former Yale law school professor Burke Marshall and Senator Ted Kennedy. Eventually, because of a number of her unethical practices I decided that I could not recommend her for any subsequent position of public or private trust.'"}, "time": 1742628403.464133}
