The political divide between the two groups has been growing more stark in America for years, and 2016 showed an even sharper split than 2012. Multiple forces are pulling the American geography apart, as the   and   suburbs remain the contested political ground in between. The election reinforces the feeling that the prosperity of many metropolitan areas is not shared by the rest of the country. Mr. Trump made no real play for urban voters, despite living and running businesses in their midst. He went so far as to depict them as dystopias, a strategy that has long helped Republicans stoke enthusiasm among voters outside cities. And so it is little surprise that the urban counties that include Austin, Tex. Chicago Los Angeles Oakland, Calif. Portland, Ore. Seattle Denver and Newark voted for the Republican candidate in this election in   numbers. Mr. Trump\u2019s own Manhattan gave him just 10 percent, a new nadir for a G. O. P. presidential candidate in the borough. His    home, Washington, gave him just 4 percent. Most of the change, though, occurred not around the big cities  \u2014   where Democratic candidates have only so many votes left to pick up  \u2014   but far outside them. Just 15 counties tilted by more than five percentage points in favor of Mrs. Clinton relative to how they voted in 2012. By contrast, 1, 826 moved by at least that much away from the Democratic candidate. The counties that swung the most drastically toward Mr. Trump, by 15 points or more, were nearly all in the Midwest. That abrupt shift was probably driven by numerous factors that are hard to untangle: weak economic prospects Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lack of attention to those places on the campaign trail Mr. Trump\u2019s xenophobic message to voters anxious about change. But the widening political divergence between cities and   America also reflects a growing alienation between the two groups, and a sense  \u2014   perhaps accurate  \u2014   that their fates are not connected. The University of Wisconsin political scientist Katherine J. Cramer, the author of \u201cThe Politics of Resentment,\u201d described what this looked like during years of field research in Wisconsin in an insightful interview with Jeff Guo at The Washington Post. The people she met across a state that Mrs. Clinton ultimately lost felt deeply disrespected (and suspicious of a   academic from   Madison). \u201cThey would say, \u2018The real kicker is that people in the city don\u2019t understand us,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Cramer said. \u201c \u2018They don\u2019t understand what rural life is like, what\u2019s important to us and what challenges that we\u2019re facing. They think we\u2019re a bunch of redneck racists.\u2019 \u201d Cities, for their part, are easily branded with some dissonance as embodying either professional elites or poor people who don\u2019t deserve benefits (thus both Madison and Milwaukee, two very different places, come in for equal resentment within Wisconsin). Many of the young Democratic voters who live in blue cities like these, as Alec MacGillis has noted, have gravitated away from redder parts of the country from which they felt alienated. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing to do in Ohio,\u201d lamented one voter who grew up there but now lives in Los Angeles. \u201cThe jobs are limited, but it\u2019s not just the jobs and the industries that are in Ohio, it\u2019s the   that I didn\u2019t gravitate to. \u201d As the relationship between density and partisanship has grown stronger over the last   the structure of the economy has also changed in ways that reinforce the divide. At the height of Detroit\u2019s auto industry in the early 1950s, the C. E. O. of General Motors, Charles Wilson, memorably pronounced that what was good for the country was good for his company, and vice versa. That\u2019s no longer true of the major industries in big American cities (or the people who work for them) argues Aaron Renn, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. G. M. had trouble selling cars when the national economy was bad. Its customer base depended on a stable middle class far from Detroit. That\u2019s not true today of Facebook, or Google, or Goldman Sachs, Mr. Renn says. They don\u2019t rely on dealers all over the country. Their bottom lines aren\u2019t tied to material prosperity in   Wisconsin. \u201cIn a sense, the   economy in these urban areas is disconnected from the success from the rest of the country,\u201d Mr. Renn said. And the very things that drive success in Silicon Valley\u2019s tech industry, or New York City\u2019s financial sector, are what worries rural America: globalization, foreign trade, immigration. \u201cGoldman Sachs and Google do not really need America to be a     success in order for them to be personally successful. \u201d Those economic forces will probably grow only stronger, even as the effects of an election that pushed urban and rural America further apart recede.'"}, "time": 1742564600.4419582}
