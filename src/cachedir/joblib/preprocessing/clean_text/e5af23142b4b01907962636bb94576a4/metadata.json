It\u2019s the title of a song that Rihanna and Drake have made pretty much 2016\u2019s best single, and the partial title of another that Fifth Harmony\u2019s made one of the year\u2019s naughtiest. The entire Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cLemonade\u201d experience involves the work of marriage and black womanhood. But no musician\u2019s been more literal about the work he\u2019s doing than Frank Ocean. \u201cWork\u201d because, late last month, he ended four years of obscurity with maximal creative output: new songs, a glossy   magazine, one   music video, one   music    tutorial, and four superbly   bodegas in four cities. Compliments of Mr. Ocean, the stores gave out the magazine and a CD, whose music was available for download exclusively through Apple and only as a single,   entity formerly known as an album. The most instructive piece of Mr. Ocean\u2019s data dump is that 45 minutes. Packaged as a curio called \u201cEndless,\u201d it stars assorted Mr. Oceans (three of him) wearing sweats and sweaters, sending planks of wood through a table saw as airy, new, sporadically inviting music inhabits the soundtrack. It celebrates the making of something. By hand. In a sense, he\u2019s just crafting. He\u2019s also crafting mystique. Were he a different artist, Mr. Ocean might have made a perfunctory appearance at the Video Music Awards on Sunday, if only to say: \u201cHey  \u2014   I\u2019ve got this album. Here\u2019s a song from it,\u201d the way Kanye West used his slot for the premiere of a new video. But \u201cEndless\u201d proves that\u2019s not what he\u2019s about. The showmanship of the V. M. A.s seems beside Mr. Ocean\u2019s point. The   of his peers illuminates his indifference to it. Mr. Ocean is   it\u2019s \u201cEndless\u201d because the work never ends. Mr. Ocean presents himself not as an artist, per se, but as an art student, a hermit laboring in a business that runs on extroversion. As much I might like to see him do a lap of Carpool Karaoke, I\u2019m not going to hold my breath. In this era of meticulous   his apparent apartness feels like something to celebrate. Sure, the randomness of the magazine\u2019s content and the vague, plaintive earnestness of some lyrics are more unfashionably adolescent  \u2014   more Tumblr  \u2014   than you\u2019d want from a   . But his     melancholy is a draw. He\u2019s got the No. 1 album in the country, much to the bafflement of a music industry used to artists who want what it wants. He\u2019s both giving away and selling  \u2014   and selling himself sparingly, decorously. Looks like him, shirtless and wet, on the cover of the new record, \u201cBlonde\u201d (spelled \u201cBlond\u201d on the cover). His head\u2019s down, his face behind his hand, his hair a Joker shade of green. Maybe he\u2019s cracking up maybe he\u2019s breaking down. He spends \u201cEndless\u201d in long shots and a few   toiling alongside those clones of himself. Shrunk down to smartphone size, however, the black and white render him a mere design element. It isn\u2019t just that you can\u2019t see him much. You can\u2019t always hear his natural voice, either. Technology on \u201cBlonde\u201d distorts his singing, and usually that\u2019s alluring  \u2014   like David Bowie in one of his alien phases. But it also sounds like   as on \u201cNikes,\u201d the album\u2019s opening song. In the glittered short video, he sits outside in front of a car, his eyes rimmed in makeup. Elsewhere, he\u2019s lying on the ground in different jump suits  \u2014   one white and   one black and ablaze, eventually being extinguished. He\u2019s human on the one hand, extraterrestrial on the other  \u2014   the burning man who fell to earth. Who knows what this sense of alienation and the attraction to obscurity mean? It\u2019s not Mr. Ocean\u2019s duty to explain. But some of the breathless anticipation for new Ocean music has everything to do with the singular position he occupies. His coming out, in 2012, as a man who likes men, made him queer. And in the hetero, \u201cno homo\u201d realms of     RB and even pop, that admission made him an outlier. It\u2019s also made us desperate to know his next moves: How does a major queer artist stay major? Homosexuality might be normal in this country. But a gay, black, male pop star is treated like an oracle, despite nothing in his discography bespeaking the oracular. It hasn\u2019t been just music we needed from him. Unfairly or not, it\u2019s been symbolism. What\u2019s notable about this new music is how guarded it is, against meaning too much and meeting too many expectations. You can hear pain, confusion, curiosity, dispassion, anomie, defensiveness and need, feelings that were present on his magnificent previous album, from 2012, \u201cChannel Orange. \u201d But there he housed feelings and moods within somewhat traditional song structures. He built songs around those feelings. The approach on \u201cBlonde\u201d and in \u201cEndless\u201d is deconstructionist. The best song on \u201cEndless\u201d doesn\u2019t even belong to him. It\u2019s a dreamy   position paper called \u201cDevice Control,\u201d by the photographer Wolfgang Tillmans. Emotionally, Mr. Ocean finds loneliness instead of redemption, expressed in spare guitars, keyboards, static, noise and outsourced exasperation. For now, other people seem more interesting to him. This year is the 25th anniversary of \u201cTruth or Dare,\u201d Madonna\u2019s landmark authorized peep show into her touring life. It\u2019s still revealing layers of its star. \u201cEndless\u201d and \u201cBlonde\u201d reject that kind of disclosure. For instance, we don\u2019t know the names of the people who\u2019ve headlined Mr. Ocean\u2019s hurt. He\u2019s not Taylor Swift. He hasn\u2019t made his \u201cLemonade. \u201d He doesn\u2019t believe in blind news items. He believes in blinds. These are projects that prize process over persona. Unlike Beyonc\u00e9, he didn\u2019t wake up like this. Unlike Beyonc\u00e9, he offers carpentry that\u2019s literal: Mr. Ocean is grainin\u2019 on actual wood. He\u2019s all work, no play. And artistically, it makes Frank a dull guy. (Isn\u2019t it worth noting that, in 2013, he lost the best new artist Grammy to the band Fun?) That processing is in the music: the minimalism the rejection of   pop the Sonic Youth, Radiohead and Arthur Russell the creative ranginess of Mr. West. If kicky new songs like \u201cIvy,\u201d \u201cNights\u201d and \u201c \u201d let you think he was headed toward Stevie Wonder, Prince or even Bill Withers: Oops. Mr. Ocean appears to be trying out an aesthetic and, for now, that aesthetic appears to be excessive asceticism. A denial, a denial, a denial. He didn\u2019t invent idiosyncratic independence. He\u2019s just dramatizing it. That makes the   gap between now and \u201cChannel Orange\u201d significant. He\u2019s been exploring vocations. What he\u2019s creating in \u201cEndless\u201d turns out to be a set of stairs. So, really, he\u2019s making a statement  \u2014   first about ascendance (he\u2019s building his way up and out) then about effort: He\u2019s doing it all himself, metaphorically declaring his independence. The steps he\u2019s built aren\u2019t just any steps. They\u2019re like the golden spiral staircase, steps that, mathematically speaking and from a bird\u2019  view, carry the climber farther away from the central axis of origin at a particularly pleasing rate. Mr. Ocean has willed himself from RB curio to major pop star to art student. That might sound like a regression, and musically, maybe so. The songs, the magazine, the stores that gave them away feel like final projects. Obviously, he\u2019s released his first new work in a long time. But you could also say he\u2019s arrived at a different milestone: graduation.'"}, "time": 1742563280.476095}
