According to Limbaugh, questions need to be asked going back to the previous administration and how the leak about Flynn\u2019s interaction with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. Limbaugh criticized the media and noted Democrats are often allowed to skate on similar indiscretions without consequences. Transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): Everybody just calm down, just calm down. All of this was predicted to you, every bit of this was predicted to you. I mean the media behavior. To show you just how lame the media is and how little they\u2019ve got, they\u2019re already asking what did Trump know and when did he know it, and that\u2019s not the question. The question is, what did Barack Obama know and when did he know it and what has he engineered here? This all happened with Flynn back in December. Trump had not even been inaugurated yet. And it\u2019s still mysterious to me what really happened. Even if, even if Flynn, as the incoming national security director, had called the Russian ambassador to talk, so what? That\u2019s not hard to imagine. That\u2019s not a big deal. It really isn\u2019t a big deal. Now, if he lied to Mike Pence and said, \u201cNo, no, no, I didn\u2019t talk to the guy. I didn\u2019t talk to the guy about sanctions. I didn\u2019t talk about maybe lifting the sanctions. No, no, no, I didn\u2019t. \u201d And if he did do that, if he lied to Pence, then, okay, there\u2019s a reason for Flynn to be in trouble and maybe to resign, get out of the way. But for the media to say what did Trump know and when did he know it? Get a grip here, folks. I realize that a lot of people do not pay a whole lot of attention to this, which is good, but for those of you who are, I can imagine the impact on you, and you\u2019re asking, \u201cWell, when\u2019s he gonna stop? I mean, how much more of this can anybody take? How much more of this kind of assault and attacking nature can any administration handle. And then the other question, how long can the Republicans in Congress handle it. How long are they gonna stay bucked up and   about it, and time will tell on that. I\u2019m gonna tell you, Trump\u2019s not stopping. There will be more ICE raids this afternoon to make people forget about this. The media\u2019s gonna try as hard as they can not to let go of this, because now they\u2019ve got their scalp. They think they have blood in the water, they\u2019ve got a scalp and they think they can get another and then another and then another and then another until finally they get Trump. They have become the   resistance to Trump and they have decided that that\u2019s going to be their modus operandi for the next four years. They\u2019re not gonna do news. They have now mobilized and made it official, they\u2019re even talking about it, some of them are, on cable networks that  \u2014   I mean, they disguise the words they use, but the impact is clear that they are going to do everything they can to get Trump out of Washington and out of the White House and out of office. So what we have here, we have a political assassination that\u2019s taken place here, a political assassination, Mike Flynn, who, do you know he worked for Obama four different times? You didn\u2019t know that? Let me find the details. In September 2011, Mike Flynn was promoted to lieutenant general assigned to the office of the Director of National Intelligence by Barack Obama. On April 17th, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Michael Flynn to be the 18th director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. The defense department has its own intel operation and he ran it, as opposed to the Central Intelligence Agency. It\u2019s called the DIA, and it\u2019s big, and it\u2019s relevant, and it\u2019s important, and it does great work, and Flynn ran it after having been promoted to lead it by Obama in 2012. He took command of the DIA in July of 2012. He is a member of the Democrat Party, according to Wikipedia. Michael Flynn is a member of the Democrat Party. Aside from all of this, he has a reputation as a great man. He\u2019s also a hawk. And that\u2019s something the left just can\u2019t abide. Hawks like Michael Flynn, they may as well be Dr. Strangelove. They want to run around, they want to start nuclear war, they want to destroy the planet, they\u2019re deranged, they\u2019re unhinged, they love blood and guts, and they love the sound of gunfire and napalm in the morning, and they just love it, and this is totally unacceptable. So we have a resignation over a phone call, a freaking phone call. The Democrats don\u2019t resign when they\u2019re caught   with their hand in the till or in bed with an intern or whatever else transgression the Democrats engage in. There are no resignations and there are no demands for resignations. And if you want to compare the Trump administration to the Obama administration, you just need to ask yourself one question: Why did you vote for Trump? Eight years of the Obama administration, it may not have appeared to be chaotic and it may not have appeared to be amateur hour and it may not have appeared to be out of control, but it was in terms of its agenda. The Obama administration was trying to dismantle the United States of America. That\u2019s why everybody voted for Trump! And the people that supported Obama and were trying to dismantle the United States of America are still out trying to do it and now doing so via taking aim at Trump and his administration. Flynn I guess didn\u2019t want to be a distraction, especially given how worked up the   are. \u2018Cause the   are seeing a Russian under every bed. The   are seeing a Russian at every computer keyboard. You know, they walk in their own offices, see a keyboard, they see a computer, and they think the Russians are there. Now, the media is saying that Flynn\u2019s conversation with the Russian ambassador back in December could have left him open to blackmail. Are we serious about this? Flynn was open to blackmail? Who was it that the   wanted to see as president in? That would be Hillary Rodham Clinton, who could have been blackmailed six ways from Sunday by the Russians and who the heck else we know. We don\u2019t know who has those 34, 000 emails that she deleted. We don\u2019t know who has Tom Brady\u2019s jersey. (laughing) We\u2019re trying to find both. We don\u2019t know what top national security secrets were revealed in those 34, 000 emails. This is a woman whose home brew server was hacked by world powers, the ChiComs, the Russians. This is a woman who, with her famous Russian reset, embarrassed the United States of America. Blackmail? Here\u2019s Hillary Clinton who had collected campaign contributions supposed in advance that were nothing more than advance payments for policy considerations. She was selling access to the Oval Office via the Clinton administration. You want to talk about blackmail? You are vworried about blackmail and Michael Flynn and Donald Trump when you were going to have Hillary Clinton in the White House if you had your way? But if you watched yesterday\u2019s press conference, if you read about the fallout from it this morning, the   now smell blood, and they\u2019re   mad they weren\u2019t able to ask Trump the Flynn question yesterday \u2019cause Trump is calling on conservative media now in these press conferences, and it\u2019s really ripping the   a new one. They just can\u2019t abide it. But, folks, I really  \u2026     I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m delivering admonitions or warnings. Just a reassuring sense here that all of this was predicted. It was going to happen, just like the protests that magically and immediately sprang up after Trump announced his executive order. This is who the left is. This is what you voted against. This is what you wanted no more of, this behavior. Not by Trump, not by Flynn. What you voted against  \u2014   the reason you voted for Trump  \u2014   is exactly what you\u2019re seeing day to day now from the left and from the Democrat Party and from the media.
