{"duration": 0.10955810546875, "input_args": {"text": "'\u201cTurns Out North Korea\u2019s Economy Is Actually Doing Pretty Well,\u201d the headline at Vox proclaims. The bulk of the article offers nothing to support this assertion. [The piece is based heavily on a \u201cfascinating article\u201d in the New York Times, which purportedly demonstrated how North Korea \u201chas been experiencing economic success in recent years by taking steps toward allowing private enterprise to spread throughout the country. \u201d  \u201cAccording to the Times, some experts estimate that the North Korean economy could be growing between 1 and 5 percent per year. If North Korea\u2019s economy is actually growing at the higher end of that estimate  \u2014   say, around 4 percent  \u2014   the country would be showing surprising resilience in the face of international sanctions,\u201d Vox chirped. And then, four paragraphs in, Vox splashed a little cold water in its face and remembered which country it is talking about, admitting that North Korean quality of life is \u201cnightmarish\u201d and marked by \u201crampant food shortages,\u201d leaving 70 percent of the population dependent on food aid and 40 percent of the people malnourished. Nevertheless, Vox persisted, gamely forging ahead with an argument that black markets and tiny     marketplaces were prodding North Korea toward a   uprising against centralized control.  Late in the article, Vox mentions that 80 percent of North Korea\u2019s consumer goods come from China but leaves out the more pertinent fact that North Korea gets almost all of its oil from China. China and a few other friendly states indulge the illicit trade that provides Pyongyang with much of the equipment and hard currency needed for its weapons programs. That is how North Korea \u201csurvives sanctions. \u201d  The country\u2019s economic system is basically a laboratory experiment in feral communist brainwashing financed by Beijing. China keeps this nightmare going because it loathes the notion of a reunified Korea allied with the United States and because it likes having a vicious attack dog snarling at the Western world and its Pacific Rim friends.  China profits a great deal by promoting itself as the only hand that can tame the Kim regime. The cost of keeping North Korea\u2019s \u201ceconomy\u201d afloat has been reasonable until now. That   analysis is changing as Pyongyang closes in on nuclear ICBM technology, which is why Beijing seems to be dealing more sternly with the Kim regime than ever before. There is nothing more to the North Korean economic picture than this, which Vox slowly figures out by the end of its silly article, since not the faintest trace of the headline assertion that \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s economy is actually doing pretty well\u201d remains by the final paragraph. It is actually a story about how starving and terrified North Korean citizens are trying to use a little market cooperation to survive the hideous communist economy they are trapped in. Black markets are the defiance of an economic system, not a component of it. Part of the problem here is an absurdity of scale. Four percent \u201cgrowth\u201d for a   starvation economy is nothing. That is like saying a man with ten cents in his pocket who discovers a dime on the street has doubled his financial holdings.  The low end of the growth estimate that served as the entire premise for the Vox article was one percent, which sounds more like the \u201ctotally stagnant economic backwater\u201d Vox claims North Korea is not. Even that paltry estimate is based on the highly dubious assumption that any meaningful economic data can be extracted from the North Korean dungeon state. Communist tyrannies have a long history of manufacturing fraudulent data to make themselves look prosperous. \u201cNorth Korea is doing pretty well\u201d stories erupt almost every year, based on similarly flawed economic analyses that speculate the dungeon state\u2019s economy might be growing a little. There was a previous boomlet of such media coverage in the summer of 2015, prompting The Diplomat to conduct a bit of debunking.  After duly noting that all economic data from North Korea is suspect and pointing out that North Korean growth stories always ignore the many negative economic events plaguing the secretive nation, The Diplomat quoted blogger Joshua Stanton explaining that North Korea really has two economies and the larger one keeps the bulk of the population in a constant state of misery: North Korea\u2019s economy is bifurcated between the   in the provinces and the haves  \u2014   the regime, the elites, and the donju (middle class) who are are mostly   figures who trade with and on behalf of the regime, and largely supply the elite with goods that aren\u2019t available to most North Koreans. Although there is more overlap between these economies today than there was five years ago, these remain two distinct economies for the most part. No, North Korea\u2019s economy is not \u201cdoing well,\u201d and there is little solid evidence that it\u2019s doing better than it was last year. It endures the pressure of sanctions because China constantly relieves that pressure and because murderous totalitarian regimes can absorb a great deal of economic pain with their captive populations. Even a   and dependent tyranny can afford to maintain a small ruling clique in high style. Only China can exert the type of pressure that would really hurt North Korea\u2019s rulers.'"}, "time": 1742563916.2312508}
