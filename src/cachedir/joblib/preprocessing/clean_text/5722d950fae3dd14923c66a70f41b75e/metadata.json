[Members of the   AIK Ultras, the dedicated fans of Stockholm\u2019s Allm\u00e4nna Idrottsklubben (AIK) team, also unfurled a giant banner at the match in Sweden Sunday thanking the law for a religious provision loophole.  Swedish law specifically bans people in \u201ca public place attending a public meeting under the Public Order Act\u201d if there is a disturbance of the peace, or \u201cimmediate danger of such a breach\u201d  \u2014   making full face coverings generally illegal at football games. Those breaking the law can be fined or imprisoned for up to six months. Yet understanding of particular religious minorities in Sweden means the second paragraph of the face covering law created an exception: \u201cThe ban does not apply to covering the face for religious reasons. \u201d La Su\u00e8de ayant interdit le port de masques et cagoules dans les stades, les ultras portent d\u00e9sormais des niqabs  \u2026    . dont le port est l\u00e9gal. pic. twitter.   \u2014   PassionFootball Club (@PassionFootClub) April 4, 2017,  Making the most of the new law intended to curb antisocial behaviour at football games, large numbers of AIK Ultra members were seen at the game wearing niqabs  \u2014   the full face covering cloth which forms part of the Islamic hijab. The colossal banner held by fans in the stands made reference to the Swedish politician who introduced the ban, Anders Ygeman. It read: \u201cAIK\u2019s ultras are well meaning, we\u2019re now wearing masks for religious reasons. Freedom for ultras is the goal, thanks Ygeman for the loophole. \u201d Speaking to bestselling Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet\u2019s Sportbladet section, Minister of Home Affairs Ygeman said he found the episode \u201cpretty funny\u201d and said the fans clearly had a sense of humour  \u2014   but said if fans continued to use the religious exception the courts may decide the legal loophole doesn\u2019t apply on a    basis if they found   men up before them. The minister confirmed that police would not require football fans turning up to matches in niqabs to prove their religion on the spot.  While the Swedish mask ban was introduced to deal with particular problems, including violence at matches, this is not the first time European football fans have invoked Islam to make political points. Breitbart London reported in 2015 when Polish football fans unfurled a giant   \u2018stand and defend Christianity\u2019 banner at a premier league match. Running to thousands of square feet, the banner depicted an armed crusader standing over Europe repelling migrant boats carrying terrorists.  '"}, "time": 1742564149.8521388}
