In the video, obtained by TMZ, the dog appears to be fighting to stay out of the   stream as a man in a green suit wrestles to put the animal in. The footage then cuts to a scene of the dog submerged as people swim toward it. A voice can be heard yelling  : \u201cCut it! Cut it!\u201d The source of the video, recorded in 2015, was not immediately clear, but the filmmakers have not disputed its authenticity. The identity of the man in the video was also not immediately revealed. Amblin Entertainment, the film\u2019s producer, and Universal Pictures, its distributor, said in a joint statement on Thursday night that it was in the \u201cbest interest\u201d to cancel the premiere and press junket set for Saturday in Los Angeles. The statement said Amblin\u2019s review into the video was continuing. The movie, starring Dennis Quaid, will open in theaters nationwide on Jan. 27 as scheduled. \u201cAmblin and Universal do not want anything to overshadow this film that celebrates the relationship between animals and humans,\u201d the statement said, adding: \u201cSince the emergence of the footage, Amblin has engaged with many associated with the production of the film, including safety personnel, trainers and stunt coordinators as part of their   review. While we are all disheartened by the appearance of an animal in distress, everyone has assured us that Hercules the German shepherd was not harmed throughout the filmmaking. \u201d In a statement on Wednesday, Amblin and Universal said Hercules was \u201chappy and healthy. \u201d \u201cThere were several days of rehearsal of the water scenes to ensure Hercules was comfortable with all of the stunts,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cOn the day of the shoot, Hercules did not want to perform the stunt portrayed on the tape, so the Amblin production team did not proceed with filming that shot. \u201d For a movie aimed squarely at an audience of dog lovers, the footage threatens to repel the precise audience filmmakers hope to draw. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has urged moviegoers to boycott the film. Several people involved in the film condemned the actions seen in the video. Lasse Hallstrom, the director, said on Twitter he had not witnessed the events but was \u201cvery disturbed\u201d by the footage. He said he had been promised \u201ca thorough investigation. \u201d \u201cWe were all committed to providing a loving and safe environment for all the animals in the film,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been a lifelong animal lover, and \u2018A Dog\u2019s Purpose\u2019 is my third film about dogs. The animals\u2019 safety was of utmost priority. \u201d Josh Gad, an actor who voices one of the dogs in the film and said he was never on the set, released a statement on Twitter that said he had \u201csigned on to a film that truly stands out as one of the most beautiful love letters to animals I have ever seen. \u201d He added he was \u201cshaken and sad to see any animal put in a situation against its will,\u201d and had contacted the production team and studio to ask for an explanation. Mark Stubis, a spokesman for the American Humane Association, which monitors animals on movie sets, said in a statement that a representative had been present during filming. The employee was later placed on administrative leave, and the organization was \u201cbringing in an independent third party to conduct an investigation,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cWhen the dog showed signs of resistance to jumping in the water, the scene should have been stopped,\u201d Mr. Stubis said. The movie, whose cast also includes Peggy Lipton, is based on a book of the same name by W. Bruce Cameron. He wrote on Facebook on Wednesday that he was \u201cas disturbed as you were by the video I saw earlier today. \u201d Dog lovers on social media appeared to be unforgiving. \u201cThis was abuse, and that human shoving the dog into the water should be charged,\u201d one woman wrote in response to Mr. Cameron\u2019s post. \u201cIt is inexcusable, and I won\u2019t be spending money to see this movie. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561747.9610877}
