The Hamilton County prosecutor, Joseph T. Deters, made the announcement at a news conference in Cincinnati after an investigation that relied on the recollections of four witnesses. \u201cShe was being attentive to her children by all witness accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the    just scampered off. \u201d Ms. Gregg, 32, who was also accompanied on the trip by three of the boy\u2019s sisters on May 28, had turned her back for a matter of \u201cseconds\u201d when the child made a beeline for the Gorilla World enclosure, Mr. Deters said. \u201cIf anyone doesn\u2019t believe a    can scamper off very quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve never had kids because they can, and they do. \u201d In a statement, the Gregg family said it was pleased with the decision. \u201cThis is one more step in allowing us to put this tragic episode behind us and return to our normal family life,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe extend thanks to all of those who have been praying for us and who have supported us through this trying ordeal and praise to God for his mercy and grace. \u201d Ms. Gregg had faced intense public scrutiny, as well as unrelenting invective on social media, over what some saw as her failure to block the boy from the pen. After breaching a   fence, the boy fell about 15 feet into a shallow moat and was then dragged around by Harambe, a western lowland gorilla weighing more than 420 pounds. Zoo workers, fearing for the child\u2019s safety, shot and killed the animal. By early Monday, a petition demanding that Ms. Gregg be investigated for evidence of child neglect had nearly half a million signatures from people who called her attention to the boy \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cgrossly negligent. \u201d Ms. Gregg has declined to give interviews, but in statements released through a spokeswoman, Gail Myers, the family said it had cooperated with the police investigation. The family had no plans to sue the zoo, Ms. Myers said. Witnesses at the zoo described panicked moments as Harambe at times seemed to take a protective posture with the child, but would then yank him violently by the ankle. Thane Maynard, the zoo\u2019s director, said the boy\u2019s head was \u201cbanging on concrete. \u201d In Ms. Gregg\u2019s 911 call, she sounds frantic: \u201cHe\u2019s dragging my son,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t watch this. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. \u201d The screams of the crowd added another volatile element, causing Harambe to become agitated and disoriented, zoo officials said. After about 10 minutes, zoo officials made the fraught decision to kill the endangered animal, firing a single rifle shot to Harambe\u2019s head as he stood over the boy. The boy ended up with scrapes and bruises, but no serious injuries. \u201cThis is a beautiful little boy,\u201d Mr. Deters said on Monday, \u201cand had they not acted and this animal behaved sometimes like animals behave, we could have had a genuine tragedy here. \u201d The zoo faced harsh questions over its decision to use live rounds rather than a tranquilizer dart, and was criticized for erecting a security barrier that could be so easily breached by a small boy. Mr. Maynard, the zoo director, said that the drug would not have acted quickly enough in a situation that at any second could have turned deadly for the boy. The pierce of a dart also presented a risk of startling the powerful animal, he said. The zoo has also defended the barrier around the gorilla enclosure as adequate, noting that until May it had not once been breached since the exhibit opened in 1978. Still, last week the zoo unveiled a reinforced version, raised to 42 inches and secured by wooden beams and knotted rope netting. The exhibit is scheduled to reopen on Tuesday. The Department of Agriculture and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums have both opened investigations into the episode. During his news conference, Mr. Deters defended the zoo\u2019s decision to kill the animal: \u201cThe one thing I will say, the zoo lost a beautiful animal, one that many people in this area have enjoyed watching for a long time, but it\u2019s still an animal. \u201cIt does not equate human life,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they felt that this boy\u2019s life was in jeopardy, and they made the painful choice to do what they did. \u201d Western lowland gorillas are considered critically endangered, with fewer than 175, 000 left in the wild in Africa. The zoo said Harambe, who was born in captivity and turned 17 the day before he was killed, was an intelligent and curious animal on his way to becoming a group leader. Last week, the Gregg family asked that people offering to send money direct it instead to the Cincinnati Zoo in Harambe\u2019s name.'"}, "time": 1742564134.434596}
