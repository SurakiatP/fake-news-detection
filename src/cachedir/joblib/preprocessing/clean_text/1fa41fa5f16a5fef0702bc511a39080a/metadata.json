I hated it and I wasn\u2019t even bouncing up and down. It was just all wobbly underfoot. Made me queasy. \\n\u201cThe hedgehog in this advert is not real. It is an unnatural, computer generated abomination.\u201d \\nHobbs added: \u201cHedgehogs are very much ground-based creatures. We eat grubs and roll into a ball for protection. \\n\u201cIn our leisure time we watch stuff like Bake Off and Orange is the New Black . The most excitement we have is the occasional game of Buckaroo!. \\n\u201cAnyway, keep your brats on a leash or we\u2019ll give them scabies.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561963.9530125}
