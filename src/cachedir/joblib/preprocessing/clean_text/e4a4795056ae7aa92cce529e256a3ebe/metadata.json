S.[That\u2019s according to a NewsBusters investigation, which also found that \u201c[b]etween them, ABC, CBS and NBC only spent 68 seconds during their news coverage the following morning\u201d after Obama ended the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy for Cubans.  NewsBusters adds: Both actions severely limited immigration from certain regions, but CBS This Morning and NBC\u2019s Today hyped the Castro regime \u201cpraising\u201d Obama\u2019s policy decision. In contrast, the coverage of Trump\u2019s executive order has been overwhelmingly negative, with NBC\u2019s Today even going so far as to suggest a link between Trump\u2019s immigration ban and a mass shooting at a mosque in Quebec, despite a complete lack of evidence.   \u2026     But this wasn\u2019t the only instance of the networks ignoring one of President Obama\u2019s bans on refugees. It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that ABC News reported that \u201cState Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011,\u201d after the discovery that two   operatives had used the program to enter the U. S. and move to Bowling Green, Kentucky.   \u2026       \u2026     CBS and NBC never followed up on the story, and ABC dropped its coverage after that single day of attention. Coverage of Obama\u2019s rapprochement and normalization of relations with Cuba has been generally laudatory, ignoring the Cuban regime\u2019s complete failure to make progress on democracy and human rights, while praising the diplomatic commitment of the Obama administration to back down, unilaterally.
