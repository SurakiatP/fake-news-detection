[Above Griffin\u2019s head in the   cartoon is a caption that reads, \u201cAlternative fact: we are the smartest comedy on Television. \u201d   Conway\u2019s inauguration ceremony outfit was the subject of much mocking by members of the mainstream media and many Hollywood celebrities. Last year, the main character for MacFarlane\u2019s   animated series used its Emmy bid mailer to mock   candidate Trump. Griffin was a Donald Trump doppelg\u00e4nger dressed with a deep orange tan and a blonde   below a caption that read: \u201cAs long as we\u2019re voting for dumb loudmouths, can I get an Emmy?\u201d The artwork was panned by Facebook users, who flooded the Family Guy Facebook page with critical comments. \u201cFamily Guy literally became less funny as they hired more and more liberal writers,\u201d one top comment on the post read. The show\u2019s Emmy mailers have stirred controversy in the past. In 2012, the show\u2019s mailer featured Peter Griffin with a captioned message to Emmy voters that read: \u201cCome on, you bloated, overprivileged Brentwood Jews. Let us into your little club. \u201d Family Guy, which is currently in its 15th season, has never taken home an Emmy in the coveted Outstanding Animated Program or Outstanding Comedy Series categories.
