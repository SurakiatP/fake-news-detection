She said she was convinced that intrusions into Democratic Party leaders\u2019 emails were carried out by Russian hackers under orders from President Vladimir V. Putin and aided by   online trolls and social media bots to spread disinformation. \u201cIt is something that Putin has used inside Russia, outside Russia to great effect,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, and she called for an independent investigation into Russian involvement. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the Congress will pull together and realize that because of the success the Kremlin feels it\u2019s had they\u2019re not going to go away,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cSo whatever party you are, whatever business you run, whatever concerns you have, if we don\u2019t take action together to hold whoever was involved accountable, they will be back time and time again. \u201d Mrs. Clinton made the remarks at the Women in the World conference in Manhattan, where she was interviewed by the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof before an audience of about 3, 000 people. It was her first extensive interview since her loss in November to Donald J. Trump. She did not stint on criticism of the Trump White House. \u201cI don\u2019t take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning\u201d of the current administration, Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand  \u2014   I don\u2019t understand the commitment to hurt so many people that this administration, this White House, seems to be pursuing. \u201d Women in particular, she said, are under attack by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cThe targeting of women  \u2014   which is what\u2019s going on  \u2014   is absolutely beyond any political agenda,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, pointing in particular to the State Department\u2019s move to defund the United Nations Population Fund, among other programs. She criticized efforts to strip maternity care and other treatments from Republicans\u2019 failed bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThey had not a clue what that meant,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of them had ever even read the bill. \u201d She also noted that it was mostly men who were behind the push to curtail women\u2019s health benefits. \u201cThe things that come out of some of these men\u2019s mouths  \u2014   like, \u2018Why do we have to cover maternity care? \u2019\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cWell I don\u2019t know, maybe you were dropped by immaculate conception?\u201d She said Mr. Trump\u2019s two attempts at ordering travel bans aimed at people from a handful of predominantly Muslim countries had \u201creally sent a chilling effect across the world to not just Muslims, but to all kinds of people who said, \u2018Wait a second, don\u2019t you still have Lady Liberty in the New York Harbor? \u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton, in an unvarnished dig at the president, noted that Mr. Putin \u201cshook my hand\u201d when they met, a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to shake the hand of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Mrs. Clinton seemed to dismiss rumors that she would some day run for New York City mayor, saying that while she had a lot of work to do, \u201cI don\u2019t think that will include ever running for office again. \u201d She was occupied, she said, with the unfinished business of the last century  \u2014   \u201cthe rights and opportunities for women and girls. \u201d \u201cI think I have a lot to do,\u201d she said. She said she was puzzled by the fact that she was popular as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, according to polls at the time she left that job, but unpopular as a candidate. \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d she said. \u201cOh my gosh, by the time they finished with me, I was Typhoid Mary. \u201d The difference, she said, was that as secretary, \u201cit was a job that I was asked to do by a man. \u201d As a presidential candidate, she was propelled by her own ambition, a quality, she said, that studies show is seen as unappealing in a woman. Mrs. Clinton said she was at work on a book that would delve deeply into the events leading up to the election, including the decision by the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, to release a letter about the investigation into her emails so close to Election Day. Her life now? \u201cAs a person, I\u2019m O. K.,\u201d she said. \u201cAs an American, I\u2019m very worried. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563580.92517}
