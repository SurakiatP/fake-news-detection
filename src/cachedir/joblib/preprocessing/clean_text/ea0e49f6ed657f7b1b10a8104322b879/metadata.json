Their castoff scraps can be worth money, not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars. Jonathan Lethem, 52, recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive. The Beinecke Rare Book  Manuscript Library at Yale University acquired a trove of his manuscripts, letters, notes and other artifacts, which will now sit alongside material from Walt Whitman, Sinclair Lewis, James Baldwin and Marilynne Robinson in its rich American literature collection. Mr. Lethem\u2019s papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of Brooklyn\u2019s literary ascendance, including \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d (1999) and \u201cThe Fortress of Solitude\u201d (2003). But as befits a lifelong collector, music obsessive, comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture, there are also   cartoons, New York 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection. \u201cFor an author who is so much fun as a novelist, it\u2019s interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well,\u201d said Melissa Barton, the curator of American prose and drama at the Beinecke. (Ms. Barton, citing library policy, declined to say what Yale paid in the sale, which was arranged by the Manhattan book dealer Glenn Horowitz.) Mr. Lethem\u2019s archive also includes two computer hard drives, a laptop and other digital materials, especially from more recent years. \u201cYou can feel the evaporation of the physical ephemera,\u201d Mr. Lethem, whose most recent novel, \u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d appeared in October, said in an interview. But the bulk of the collection consists of   artifacts, some of them charmingly weird. We asked Mr. Lethem, who left New York in 2010 to teach creative writing at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif. about some of the odder items in his literary closet. The archive includes a number of   comic books Mr. Lethem made as a child, featuring invented superheroes like   Man, whose origin story included an   attempt to start a nudist colony in Alaska. In one installment,   Man (who later got a passing   in \u201cThe Fortress of Solitude\u201d) battled Ed Koch, who was no hero to Mr. Lethem\u2019s   bohemian parents. \u201cI didn\u2019t make multiple copies to sell or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was more like I was collecting my own weird artifacts from a pretend universe where   Man was a real comic. \u201d Mr. Lethem swiped this sticker after stumbling on a shoot for the 1979 movie \u201cThe Warriors\u201d in the   subway station in Brooklyn, which was standing in for the Times Square station. \u201cThis was my subway stop, and the fact that they were turning it into 42nd Street seemed absurd,\u201d Mr. Lethem recalled. \u201cI remember thinking that no one would see or hear about this movie. Nothing that anyone was shooting in my neighborhood could possibly be important. \u201d The archive contains typescripts of his novels, often affixed with alternate titles. (Would \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d have been a hit if it had been called \u201cJerks From Nowhere\u201d?) The earliest is \u201cApes in the Plan,\u201d an unpublished \u201cfake Philip K. Dick novel,\u201d as Mr. Lethem put it, named for a Devo lyric and written between ages 18 and 23. \u201cI wrote three novels on an electric typewriter,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I live long enough, I could end up being one of the last living humans who can say that. \u201d This diary tracking his writing progress, social interactions, exercise and, um, digestion comes from the   when Mr. Lethem had dropped out of Bennington College and moved to Berkeley, Calif. to try to become a writer. \u201cI had thrust myself into a kind of vacuum,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no visible means of support, nor was anyone expecting to hear from me. This kind of weird   probably had to do with externalizing my superego and answering the question \u2018Who are you and what did you actually do today? \u2019\u201d About those drawings of vomiting cats   \u2026     \u201cFor about 15 years, every time I had a really good dance party that went late, with people lolling around drunk and exhausted, at about 2 a. m. I would hand out paper and ask everyone to draw a vomiting cat,\u201d Mr. Lethem said. \u201cI ended up with an incredibly thick file of drawings, some by people who went on to be published cartoonists and writers. \u201d Some of the goofy character names in Mr. Lethem\u2019s novels are drawn from   lists he typed up early in his career, a habit he connects with the wordplay of \u201cMotherless Brooklyn,\u201d whose narrator has Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Mr. Lethem recalled a moment of recognition sparked by an Oliver Sacks essay about a surgeon with Tourette\u2019s who kept a list of more than 200 unusual names as \u201ccandy for the mind. \u201d \u201cHe was collecting real names,\u201d Mr. Lethem said. \u201cBut when I read that, I thought, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s me. \u2019\u201d Names from this list showed up in \u201cGun, With Occasional Music\u201d (1994) and \u201cChronic City\u201d (2009). \u201cThe Fortress of Solitude,\u201d inspired by Mr. Lethem\u2019s Brooklyn childhood, describes a   store called Samuel J. Underberg, \u201ca site of mysterious life,\u201d where graffiti artists came to buy ink that was specially formulated for stamping prices on slimy packages of meat and therefore ideal for tagging. While writing, Mr. Lethem acquired some random items from the real Underberg\u2019s (now demolished) which are shown here with a 1978 Billboard Hot 100 list, an old calendar and other research materials. \u201cI became a collector of all this tawdry used signage,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought it was really weird and cool. \u201d The archive contains dozens of letters from fellow writers and artists, including Donna Tartt, Paul Auster, Suzanne Vega, Jennifer Egan, Thomas Berger and Ursula K. Le Guin. This missive, written on an airline safety card, is from the novelist David Bowman, who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 2012. \u201cAll his letters were like mail art,\u201d Mr. Lethem said. \u201cDavid had a great, crazy brain. He never stopped covering the world in language. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563638.8073227}
