He praised the NRA for the work it was doing to defend the right to keep and bear arms and pointed out that a large portion of the group\u2019s two and a half million members had rallied to defeat gun control in California in November 1982.  He then said, \u201cIt\u2019s a nasty truth, but those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws. \u201d He added, \u201cI happen to know this from personal experience,\u201d referencing the assassination attempt on his own life in March 30, 1981. Reagan then said, \u201cI\u2019ve always felt a special bond with the members of your group. You live by Lincoln\u2019s words, \u2018Important principles may and must be inflexible. \u2019\u201d He added: [The NRA\u2019s] philosophy put its trust in people, so you insist [that] individuals be held responsible for their actions.  The NRA believes that America\u2019s laws were made to be obeyed and that our constitutional liberties are just as important today as 200 years ago. And by the way, the constitution does not say that government shall decree the right to keep and bear arms. The constitution says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Reagan gave his NRA speech in 1983 and no president followed suit until President Donald Trump. The NRA announced that Trump will speak at the Annual Meetings on April 28, 2017, in Atlanta. NRATV is celebrating Trump\u2019s coming speech in a video that features snippets of Reagan\u2019s 1983 speech, then segues to candidate Trump speaking at the Annual Meetings in 2016, when the NRA endorsed him. The video then anticipates the   Amendment comments that President Trump will make at this year\u2019s Annual Meetings and the work he and the NRA will continue doing to protect the right to keep and bear arms. The video is titled, \u201cIt\u2019s Morning in America, Once Again. \u201d It\u2019s Morning in America, Once Again. #NRAAM2017 @realDonaldTrump @NRA pic. twitter.   \u2014   NRATV (@NRATV) April 24, 2017,  AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
