The entire report proves Trump\u2019s Russian connection and was provided to the FBI in August by a \u201cveteran spy\u201d\u2014 and publicly revealed this afternoon . Here\u2019s the conclusion: \\n\u201cRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.\u201d It maintained that Trump \u201cand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.\u201d It claimed that Russian intelligence had \u201ccompromised\u201d Trump during his visits to Moscow and could \u201cblackmail him.\u201d It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on \u201cbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.\u201d \\nThe former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was \u201cshock and horror.\u201d The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos\u2014some of which referred to members of Trump\u2019s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,\u201d he says. \\n\u201cThis is something of huge significance, way above party politics,\u201d the former intelligence officer comments. \u201cI think [Trump\u2019s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.\u201d \\nThe above bombshell has been confirmed by the federal government. The western spy revealed that the Kremlin began working with Trump up to five years ago. \\nUltimately, this western spy went to the FBI due to the seriousness of the information that he had uncovered. \\nA senior US government official not involved in this case but familiar with the former spy tells Mother Jones that he has been a credible source with a proven record of providing reliable, sensitive, and important information to the US government. \\nA former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump\u2014and that the FBI requested more information from him. \\nIn June, the former Western intelligence officer\u2014who spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients\u2014was assigned the task of researching Trump\u2019s dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm. This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project\u2019s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) \u201cIt started off as a fairly general inquiry,\u201d says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, \u201cthere was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.\u201d \\nThis was, the former spy remarks, \u201can extraordinary situation.\u201d He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative\u2014without the permission of the US company that hired him\u2014he sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified. (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was \u201csufficiently serious\u201d to share with the FBI. \\nThis newest Mother Jones report is chilling news, implicating the Trump campaign in the kind of high level dirty politics that the Republican\u2019s political hero Richard Nixon would\u2019ve found awfully familiar \u2013only with a bizarre Russian twist. Nixon resigned in disgrace after an investigation found evidence that he\u2019d ordered a break-in to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s offices at the Watergate Hotel seeking information to swing his election. Trump doesn\u2019t look like he will get that opportunity, but might face just as much public scrutiny in the wake of election day due to his Russian ties. \\nDonald Trump is the first American politician in history to openly beg Russia for help in an election, let alone in a presidential campaign. The Republican certainly has benefitted from a string of stolen email releases, which has strangely only afflicted Democrats \u2014 and not a single Republican. \\nWatch Trump admit to MSNBC that he has a relationship with Putin \u2013 twice:'"}, "time": 1742564158.105938}
