During the Jim Crow era, acts of terror committed against black Mississippians was disturbingly common. It seems for at least one Trump supporter, the term \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d means returning to that dark time. \\nBut rather than let this disgusting display of intolerance be the story, Americans got to work. In just hours, a verified GoFundMe account was set up by concerned citizens and thousands of dollars began to pour in to help rebuild. \\nIt\u2019s goal was to raise $10,000. It likely wouldn\u2019t be enough to repair all of the damages inside and outside of the church, but it would be a start. Instead, people gave over $150,000. And perhaps even more remarkably, the entire world appeared ready to reject the deplorable racism and bigotry that led to this act. The campaign\u2019s organizer updated the campaign by saying that people from all faiths (and none at all) and many countries have contributed: \\nResponses have been pouring in from all over the world, and they\u2019re truly extraordinary. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists and many more, from all over the United States and many other countries. \\nAnd according to GoFundMe\u2019s VP of Communications and Policy Dan Pfeiffer, this campaign is perhaps the fastest growing in the history of the site. This one right here is verified and one of our fastest growing history https://t.co/E4smWW2s7d https://t.co/xIQWY4ulsV \\n\u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) November 3, 2016 \\nA slogan that has often been used to counter Trump\u2019s message of cynical bigotry comes to mind: Love trumps hate. \\nFeatured image via GoFundMe'"}, "time": 1742564097.8269486}
