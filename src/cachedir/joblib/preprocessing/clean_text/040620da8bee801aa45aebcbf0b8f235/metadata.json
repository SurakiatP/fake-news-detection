Maybe they have a guilty conscience because of the refugee crises. \" \u201cWhy can\u2019t those people get a simple concept through their heads?\u201d \u2026by Jonas E. Alexis \\n\\nNo, the Khazarian Mafia and their lackeys will never report that Vladimir Putin, the man who has been called all sorts of disgusting names, is actually fighting in order to save the moral fabric of Europe. In 2014, he argued that \u201c a faith in God and a belief in Satan \u201d are incompatible. \\nPutin moved on to argue that any policy that puts \u201cmulti-child family and a same-sex partnership\u201d on the same level is on \u201cthe path to degradation.\u201d \\nMore recently, there have been numerous rape allegations in Europe. In fact, many so-called refugees have been literally caught with their pants down. The British newspaper the Independent has recently reported: \\n\u201c A man who raped a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Austria has had his conviction overturned after judges found he may have believed the child consented. \\n\u201cPolice said the 20-year-old Iraqi refugee, who has not been named, assaulted his victim in a toilet cubicle at the Theresienbad swimming pool in Vienna on 2 December last year. \\n\u201cThe child reported the rape to a lifeguard and his attacker was arrested at the scene, reportedly telling officers in initial interviews that he was experiencing a \u2018sexual emergency\u2019 after not having sex in four months.\u201d \\nObviously there is a problem here. Putin responded by saying: \u201c So, what\u2019 going on now? A refugee raped a child in one of the European countries. The court let him free on two grounds: he doesn\u2019t speak the language of the residence country, and he didn\u2019t understand that [the] boy was against the rape. It\u2019s just hard to imagine what Europeans are going\u2026 \u201cIs this the result of erosion of the traditional national values? I don\u2019t even know how to explain it. Maybe they have a guilty conscience because of the refugee crises. A society that cannot defend its children today, has no tomorrow. It has no future.\u201d \\nIndeed. We should add that the Neoconservative Mafia and their marionettes are largely responsible for the rape crisis in Europe. Never forget what flaming Neocon Daniel Pipes said. \\nAfter postulating that \u201cWestern governments should respond by helping the rebels to prevent Assad from crushing them,\u201d Pipes added back in 2013: \u201cthe West should prevent either side in the civil war from emerging victorious by helping whichever side is losing, so as to prolong their conflict.\u2019\u201d [1] \\nDid you catch the diabolical proposition here? Pipes himself admitted that this ideology is really weird: \u201cThis policy recommendation of \u2018helping whichever side is losing\u2019 sounds odd, I admit, but it is strategic.\u201d [2] \\nWell, it is only \u201cstrategic\u201d for Pipes and his minions, who have been waging a frontal war against the moral and political order from time immemorial. Their subversive movements across Europe have been responsible for Bolshevik Revolution, for Abu Ghraib, and indeed for the debacle in Syria. So, whenever people like Pipes beat the perpetual war drum, rest assured that rape will largely be the end result. \\nFurthermore, if the so-called refugees are raping boys by the numbers, then European officials should fire a moral and political shot at people like Daniel Pipes and other people who don\u2019t give a flip about saving both the Middle East and indeed Europe from slow destruction. If the late rabbi Ovadia Yosef was right, that Goyim are donkeys and that they \u201cwere born to serve\u201d Jews, [3] then it doesn\u2019t really matter who gets raped in the process at all. \\nYosef himself said that the Goyim \u201cneed to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one\u2019s donkey would die, they\u2019d lose their money. This is his servant\u2026 That\u2019s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew.\u201d [4] \\nWell, the young Goyim are dying in Europe, and no serious politician gives a flip about them because those politicians, as we shall see in the next installment, are in cahoots with the Khazarian Mafia in Israel and other places. Putin again is trying to help Europe by indirectly appealing to an implicit moral law, which he says is imbedded in traditional values. \\n[1] Daniel Pipes, \u201cSupport the Syrian Rebels?,\u201d National Review , May 12, 2013. \\n[2] Ibid. \\n[3] \u201cTradition Today: Jews and gentiles,\u201d Jerusalem Post , November 12, 2010. \\n[4] Lazar Berman, \u201c5 of Ovadia Yosef\u2019s most controversial quotations,\u201d Times of Israel , October 9, 2013.
