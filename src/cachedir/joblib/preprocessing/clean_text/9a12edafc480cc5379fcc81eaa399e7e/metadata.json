Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. \\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-25/texas-rigged-first-reports-voting-machines-switching-votes-hillary-texas \\nFrom my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? \\nIt seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. \\nFurthermore, if Trump\u2019s election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us\u2014Hillary\u2019s win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement\u2014the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn\u2019t they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? Trump takes aim at those rigging the system \\nThere are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states , including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. \\nIt is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn\u2019t even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. \\nWhat is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump\u2019s lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. Architects of \u201cRegime Change\u201d Wars \\nA threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. \\nIf the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. \\nDonald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. \\nIn contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be \u201cthe new Hitler\u201d and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia. \\nSurely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it? \\n\\nOnly in my columns and a few others in the alternative media. \\nIn other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a people\u2019s democracy protected by a free press. \\nIn truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy. \\nAlso see: \\nThe Saker explains how Vladimir Putin wrest the sovereignty of Russia away from the Anglo-Zionist Empire.
