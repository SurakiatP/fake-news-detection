[\u201cCertainly misogyny played a role,\u201d Clinton told a Women in the World Summit on Thursday. \u201cI mean, that has to be admitted. \u201d  She then went on to claim that people felt uncomfortable with her being a successful woman, claiming that there is an \u201cinverse relationship\u201d between success and popularity that only applies to women. Clinton\u2019s comments were in response to a question on why she lost the election, to which she said she believed that there was no single reason. \u201c[Like] in any campaign, there are so many different crosscurrents and events, and some have a greater impact than others,\u201d she said. It is not the first time that Clinton has blamed her unpopularity on supposed sexism. During the Democratic Party primaries in April last year, the Clinton reportedly justified her low favorability ratings as a result of sexism within the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, last September Barack Obama blamed Clinton\u2019s low poll numbers on the notion that \u201csociety [is still] grappling with what it means to see powerful women. \u201d Another former president, her husband Bill Clinton, also argued that sexist men would not vote for his wife because they couldn\u2019t \u201cfess up\u201d to the idea of having a woman president. During the election campaign, Hillary Clinton described half of the Americans supporting Donald Trump as a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d made up of \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d people. She went on to lose the Electoral College vote by 232 to Donald Trump\u2019s 306.
