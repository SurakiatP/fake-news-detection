[Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of social media giant Facebook, was one of many tech elites to speak out against President Trump\u2019s decision to leave the Paris Climate Accord. \u201cWithdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children\u2019s future at risk. \u201d wrote the billionaire CEO in a public post on Facebook.  \u201cFor our part, we\u2019ve committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy,\u201d he stated adding, \u201cStopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it\u2019s too late. \u201d Google CEO Sundar Pichai also tweeted his disapproval of Trump\u2019s decision saying, \u201cDisappointed with today\u2019s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. \u201d Brad Smith, the President and Chief Legal Officer at Microsoft took to LinkedIn to write a lengthy disapproval of the U. S. leaving the Paris Climate Accord saying, \u201cWe are disappointed with today\u2019s decision by the White House to withdraw the United States from the landmark, globally supported Paris Agreement on climate change,\u201d Smith writes. \u201cWe believe that continued U. S. participation benefits U. S. businesses and the economy in important and multiple ways. A global framework strengthens competitiveness for American businesses. It creates new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to   solutions. And by strengthening global action over time, the Agreement reduces future climate damage to people and organizations around the world. \u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an internal letter to Apple staff where he too expressed his concerns and disapproval. The full letter, as reported by TechCrunch, reads, Team, I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U. S. in the agreement. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today\u2019s developments will have no impact on Apple\u2019s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that\u2019s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well. We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a   supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we\u2019re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet\u2019s future. Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us. Your work is as important today as it has ever been. Thank you for your commitment to making a difference every single day.
