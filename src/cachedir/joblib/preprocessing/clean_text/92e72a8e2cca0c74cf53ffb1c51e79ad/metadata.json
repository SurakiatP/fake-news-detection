[Scientific American reports that Facebook is working on a device that would allow users to type words using a   interface (BCI). The device would reportedly be strapped to a user\u2019s head and decode words thought by the user, with those words then typed on a computer or smartphone at speeds of up to 100 words per minute.  The device aims to use light waves to accurately read brain waves, a challenging feat, as current BCI\u2019s must by surgically implanted into the user\u2019s brain to function and can only translate neural impulses into simple actions. Users with these types of BCI\u2019s can answer yes or no questions and click a mouse cursor but at slower speeds than what Facebook hopes to achieve. Facebook\u2019s BCI would use optical fibers to direct photons from a laser source through a person\u2019s skull and into the cerebral cortex, focusing on the areas of the brain responsible for speech. Regina Dugan, head of Facebook\u2019s Building 8 and former executive at DARPA, explained the BCI would \u201csample groups of neurons [in the brain\u2019s speech center] and analyze the instantaneous changes in optical properties as they fire. \u201d Facebook\u2019s BCI \u201cwould measure the number and type of photons that are bounced off the neurons\u201d in the brain\u2019s cortex, sending that information to a computer that would use   software to translate the information into readable text. Mark Chevillet, Building 8\u2019s technical lead on the project, said, \u201cIn this system we\u2019re looking to decode neural signals from the stage just before you actually articulate what you want to say. \u201d Adam Gazzaley, founder and executive director of U. C. San Francisco\u2019s Neuroscape translational neuroscience center, says that regardless of whether or not Facebook succeeds in the development of their BCI, their research could prove invaluable to science in the future. \u201cWe have increasing struggles to squeeze money out of the National Institutes of Health, especially to do     projects like what Facebook is describing,\u201d said Gazzaley. \u201cIt\u2019s a great sign and should be encouraged and applauded if large companies in the consumer space are taking such serious efforts to be innovative in neuroscience. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
