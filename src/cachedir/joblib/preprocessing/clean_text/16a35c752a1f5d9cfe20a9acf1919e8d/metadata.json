This map shows Obamacare premiums going up as much as 116% in some states Posted at 11:04 am on October 27, 2016 by Sam J. \\nGosh, thanks Obama. And we didn\u2019t get you anything \u2026 Brutal.

James O'Keefe wonders why these 'journalists' are ignoring Project Veritas videos \\nLook out Arizona, Obamacare is really going to kick you in the backside next year \u2013 116%!?!?! \\nHow can this be in any way, shape or form acceptable to ANY person in this country, regardless of political affiliation? We should all be absolutely disgusted with these numbers and yet the law stands. @CounterMoonbat But it's Okay because someone else will pay? \\n\u2014 Beto Ochoa (@Beto_In_Austin) October 27, 2016 \\nInteresting how Democrats really think this is how it works.
