Foster was Bill Clinton\u2019s Deputy White House Attorney, a man with intimate knowledge of the Clintons and their internal dealings while Clinton was in power during the 90\u2019s.\\nThe official story is that Foster killed himself with a single gunshot in the mouth in a Virginia park. The unofficial story is that a second bullet wound existed in Foster\u2019s neck , a wound that would have been impossible in a suicide scenario.\\nIn any event, the man often referred to as \u201cthe man who knew too much\u201d met his end in a very tragic way.
