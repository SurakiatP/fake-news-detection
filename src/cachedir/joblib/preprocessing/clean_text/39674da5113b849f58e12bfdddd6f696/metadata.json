Would the media report this if Foster wore a hoodie? \\nWe couldn\u2019t escape the media\u2019s 24-7 coverage of the death of 17-year-old 5\u2032 11\u2033 black teen Trayvon Martin and the trial of his shooter, half-Hispanic George Zimmerman. But have you heard or seen news about a 44-year-old black woman named Mona Nelson who is on trial for the murder-by-blow-torch of a 12-year-old white Texas boy, Jonathan Foster? \\nEven worse, Nelson committed the murder more than 2\u00bd years ago, on Christmas Eve 2010 \u2014 but we\u2019d heard/seen NOTHING about this. \\nThat\u2019s because in Obama\u2019s America, blacks now enjoy \u201cblack skin privilege\u201d and Big Media simply turn a blind eye to black crimes, especially black-on-white crimes. \\nAs recounted by the UK\u2019s Daily Mail , 12-year-old Foster was reported missing from his home on Christmas Eve 2010, after his mother, Angela Davis, said she had received a strange call at her workplace from a gruff-sounding woman. Davis initially told police her boy was with a babysitter. But she later admitted that he was home alone. \\nThe boy\u2019s burned body was discovered on December 28 in a roadside ditch in Houston, Texas , not far from where he lived. \\nMona Nelson told local KTRK TV that a member of Jonathan\u2019s family had given her $20 to dump a plastic container on Christmas Eve. She said she was drunk on vodka and didn\u2019t know what was inside the container. \\nBut police revealed that Jonathan\u2019s burned body had not been discovered in a plastic container, but in a ditch. Police also say Nelson\u2019s truck was spotted on surveillance footage dumping something in the ditch where the boy\u2019s body was found. In addition, investigators discovered evidence at Nelson\u2019s apartment that allegedly links her to the crime, including burned carpet and twine similar to that used to bind Jonathan\u2019s hands. \\nWhile denying she had killed Jonathan, insisting \u201cI\u2019m not a monster. I have five grandkids and I love kids,\u201d Nelson admitted having a cutting torch that she claims she used in her job as a welder. But police say she used the torch to burn the boy\u2019s body. Jonathan\u2019s home in Houston, Texas \\nCynthia Cisneros reports for KTRK on December 30, 2010, that police revealed more about Jonathan\u2019s abduction and murder at a news conference. Police believe the boy was home alone on Christmas Eve and was killed and his body dumped on that very same day. \\nNelson admitted to dumping Jonathan\u2019s badly burned body in northeast Houston off of East Hardy, but she denied killing the child. But surveillance cameras near where Jonathan\u2019s body was found showed Nelson to have lied. \\nHPD Captain David Gott said around 6pm Christmas Eve, surveillance video showed a silver truck pull up to a ditch outside of a building on East Hardy. A person, whom neighbors and family identified as Nelson, can be seen getting out of the truck, taking a body out of the bed of the truck and placing it in on the ground. Nelson also drives a similar truck. Mona Nelson\u2019s apartment \\nWhen authorities searched Nelson\u2019s apartment in northwest Houston, they found \u201ca wealth of evidence\u201d that showed Jonathan\u2019s body was burned at Nelson\u2019s residence, as well as the tools (torches and welding tools) used to burn the boy. Authorities say Nelson is a maintenance worker who works with tools and torches. Authorities believe Jonathan was taken there, killed and burned beyond recognition the same day within hours. Twine used to tie Jonathan was also found inside Nelson\u2019s home. Jonathan\u2019s burnt body was identified by his dental records. \\nA next door neighbor, Rita Jackson said Nelson was there while Jonathan\u2019s family was looking for him on Christmas Eve: \u201cYeah, she was just sitting there, looking at what was going on.\u201d Police also said they believe Nelson is a a predator who has done this before and that they don\u2019t believe her brutality begins with Jonathan. \\nThe horrible details of Jonathan\u2019s murder were too much for several detectives who struggled to keep from crying. \\n\u201cThere are few cases that impact homicide detectives \u2014 this is one of them,\u201d said HPD Homicide Detective Mike Miller , who\u2019d interviewed Nelson and held back tears as he described her. \u201cShe is a cold, soulless murderer who showed an absolute lack of remorse in taking the life of Jonathan Foster. She decided when the time was right and she swooped down and took him when she saw the time was right, and she saw an opportune moment. I\u2019ve worked in Homicide Division 14 years and this is the worst case I\u2019ve been a part of \u2014 an innocent 12 year old who everybody says was happy, outgoing and well-liked by everyone in the neighborhood. It\u2019s an absolute tragedy.\u201d Mona Nelson (l); Jonathan Foster (r) \\nKTRK reports that on August 12, 2013, the trial of Mona Nelson for the murder of Jonathan Foster finally began in a courtroom in Houston. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. Nelson has asked for a judge instead of a jury to decide the verdict. \\nAccording to Donald Joy of ClashDaily.com , \u201c Nancy Grace dropped the story as soon as she realized it was a black woman murdering a little white boy. The media have avoided the story like the plague, never once looking into whether it was a \u2018hate crime.\u2019 The original local news report has been removed. Suspect has sought and received legal counsel from local leadership of the New Black Panther Party. No story here, folks.
