Ten years of marriage. Twenty years since the founding of her namesake firm, Lizzie Grubman Public Relations  Management. And 15 since the Hamptons auto accident that dominated the tabloid news cycle for a summer, turning her into one of the most notorious women in New York. Shortly after midnight on a July morning in 2001, Ms. Grubman ignited a tabloid firestorm when she backed her father\u2019s   S. U. V. into a crowd outside the Conscience Point Inn, a Hamptons nightclub, injuring 16 people. \u201cP. R. Gal\u2019s Nightmare  \u2014   Her SUV Plows Into Hamptons Club Crowd\u201d and \u201cHard Fall for Rising P. R. Star Crash Shatters Grubman\u2019s World\u201d blared two typical New York Post headlines. It may be hard to believe now, but before Sept. 11, 2001, Ms. Grubman was one of the biggest news stories in the region. George Rush, a former gossip columnist who covered the accident and its aftermath for The Daily News, said the story played out as \u201ca larger parable about class conflict. \u201d \u201cFor many readers, Lizzie was a vicious princess who was overdue for her comeuppance,\u201d he said. Now 45, Ms. Grubman has stayed out of the spotlight for a decade. Mellowed by marriage and two children, and energized by her firm\u2019s expansion into talent management and television development, she feels ready to talk about the remarkable roller coaster of her life, and lay to rest the ghosts of that infamous summer. \u201cI do a lot of damage control, that\u2019s what I love in P. R.,\u201d Ms. Grubman said on a recent Sunday, sitting in her large corner office in the Flatiron district, which showcases \u201cRear Window\u201d style views over a uniquely Manhattan hodgepodge of apartments, construction sites and artists\u2019 studios. \u201cJust think of Olivia Pope in \u2018Scandal,\u2019 but for Hollywood. \u201d Her full client list is confidential (\u201cI do divorces, I do arrests and cop situations, when someone is resigning or getting fired,\u201d she said) but her current   roster includes the TV personalities Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Carole Radziwill, the rising   producer C4 and the pop singer Inas X. \u201cI think I\u2019ve matured, I think I\u2019ve grown up,\u201d said Ms. Grubman, dressed in a   Prada sundress and chunky platform heels, accessorized by a Givenchy Antigona black leather tote, whose oversize zipper teeth made it look like a document shredder for money. \u201cLiving a private, nonpublic life is a much happier life. \u201d Ms. Grubman was flanked by her sons, Harry, 9, and Jack, 7, and her husband, Chris Stern, executive creative director for the talent and management agency WME IMG. Mr. Stern is a chatty, gentle man with a fondness for Loro Piana cashmere sweaters. When together, the couple bring to mind a really expensive pair of new stiletto heels and the protective velvet bag that comes with them in the box. \u201cChris is my rock,\u201d said Ms. Grubman, pulling him close. \u201cHe\u2019s made me into a different person, and my children have, too. There\u2019s been some rough times. \u201d The family divides its time between their East 61st Street apartment (a triple combine duplex) and a   weekend home in Sag Harbor, N. Y. both designed by Mr. Stern. It\u2019s a life filled with children, grandparents and all the trappings of professional success. Yet even now, with a happy home life and thriving business, Ms. Grubman has difficulty discussing the events of summer 2001, when everything changed. Elizabeth Stacey Grubman was born in 1971 to Yvette and Allen Grubman, a man whom Newsweek once described as \u201cperhaps the music industry\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful attorney with superstar clients like Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, U2 and Sean (Puffy) Combs. \u201d \u201cThe trials and tribulations that she went through, just like everybody else has gone through, she came out in a way that I\u2019m very, very proud of,\u201d Mr. Grubman said. \u201cEvery so often, I\u2019ll bump into someone and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re Lizzie\u2019s father.\u2019 I get a kick out of that. \u201d Mr. Grubman was a famously bad student, a trait he passed on to his daughter. She had brief tours at four New York City private schools, including Horace Mann, Lenox and Dwight (\u201cmy social life became a little bit more important than studies,\u201d she said) followed by a single semester at Northeastern University. It was in Boston that Ms. Grubman started promoting nightclubs and the public relations career that she pursued upon returning to New York. In 1995, she went to work for Nadine Johnson, an established P. R. agent known for her fashionable roster of art world and luxury clients. But the relationship quickly soured, and she left after a year to start her own firm, amid rumors that she had taken with her Ms. Johnson\u2019s \u201clist,\u201d industry jargon for proprietary business contacts, which are jealously guarded. \u201cNadine\u2019s list is not valuable, it\u2019s only valuable to Nadine,\u201d Ms. Grubman said. \u201cI respect Nadine, I have nothing bad to say about her. She clearly does not like me. \u201d (Ms. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.) In 1998, Ms. Grubman was one of three influential young female publicists featured on the cover of New York magazine with the headline \u201cPower Girls. \u201d The article announced Ms. Grubman\u2019s arrival as a personality in her own right. It inaugurated a golden age for her business, but her    persona and moneyed background alienated some observers even as it attracted huge names to her client list, including entertainers like Jay Z, Gloria Estefan and Mr. Combs, and modish restaurants and nightclubs of fin de si\u00e8cle New York, like Moomba, Spy Bar and Asia de Cuba. \u201cShe was there by my side and protected me when I was young and just getting into the spotlight,\u201d Britney Spears, a former client for whom Ms. Grubman still occasionally consults, wrote in a text message from Los Angeles. \u201cI was so grateful to know that Lizzie always looked out for me. \u201d But the article also ruffled feathers, with its depiction of the subjects as privileged party girls, an early backlash to the \u201cprincess\u201d image that would attend Ms. Grubman for years to come. \u201cI get it,\u201d she said of the resentment at the time. \u201cIt would irritate me, too. \u201d But worse was on the way. On July 6, 2001, Ms. Grubman received the devastating news that her mother had   ovarian cancer. (She died three weeks later, at age 58.) In an emotional state, Ms. Grubman nevertheless went out that Friday evening to attend July 4 weekend festivities in the Hamptons. After a party at the home of Alex and Alexandra von Furstenberg, she drove the black Mercedes S. U. V. to the Conscience Point Inn, then a fashionable Southampton nightclub. Sometime after midnight, she got into an argument with a doorman who insisted she move her car. Instead, the vehicle lurched backward into a line of waiting patrons, injuring 16 people. Months of   denouncements and $100 million worth of lawsuits (which were quietly settled) followed, culminating with a   stay in the Suffolk County jail. Ms. Grubman publicly apologized to the victims outside the courtroom in which she pleaded guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges, but she has otherwise declined to discuss the incident. But her days of being tabloid fodder were not over. In 2005, she starred in an MTV reality show about her professional life, called \u201cPoweR Girls,\u201d which flopped with critics and viewers, lasting six episodes. (Ms. Grubman has mixed feelings about it: \u201cI think I gave away a lot of trade secrets, and I glamorized P. R. in a way that people didn\u2019t understand. \u201d) That same year, Page Six announced her relationship with Mr. Stern, who was married at the time to Joyce Sevilla, who happened to work for Lizzie Grubman P. R. The ensuing divorce was acrimonious (as were the   issues) but it freed the new couple to marry in March 2006. The gossip columns continued to needle, and it was an encounter with aggressive paparazzi that convinced Ms. Grubman that she needed to remove herself and her family from the spotlight. \u201cOne day, we\u2019re out walking, and these photographers are out for my son, and he was so scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurt him so badly. We had problems in preschool with him taking class pictures. \u201d \u201cNow, he\u2019s O. K.,\u201d she said, watching Harry gambol over her office furniture. \u201cNow he has his own Instagram. \u201d If Ms. Grubman\u2019s critics were hoping she would collapse under the sheer weight of the schadenfreude directed at her, they will be disappointed. In her stylishly decorated office, surrounded by family, she seems closer to the \u201chaving it all\u201d   balance promoted by tech industry   like the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg and the Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer. Ms. Grubman rises at 5 a. m. wakes her children at 6:30 and works from her office between 9:30 a. m. and 4 p. m. Back home, she balances work calls and family time (Mr. Stern is the cook) until a 9 p. m. bedtime. Jack, the younger son, who seemed completely at ease in her office, was asked to describe his mother. \u201cShe buys us stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she talks on the phone a lot. \u201d (Ms. Grubman laughed it off, but it seemed clear there would be some media training when he got home that night.) Amid the happy family din, however, there remains just a trace of sadness around the intertwined tragedies of her mother\u2019s death and the car accident that changed her life. When asked to reflect on that fateful night, her normally polite smile sets into a thin, flat line. \u201cThat unfortunate night happened, which I prefer not to talk about, in respect to my children and family, and the people who were involved,\u201d she said. \u201cI never properly mourned my mother. We\u2019ll leave it at that, you know why. \u201d In 2007, her husband decided to do something about it. \u201cUnderstanding that Lizzie had a really tough time with Mother\u2019s Day,\u201d Mr. Stern said, \u201cI decided, right after we had Harry, that I go to Barneys and walk around with a personal shopper and pick out the best shoes and the best handbags in the place, bring them to the apartment, and I proceeded to fill Harry\u2019s entire crib with all of these pretty special boxes of treats. \u201d \u201cIt was piled high,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to make it seem like Harry was giving her the gift. \u201d Ms. Grubman said, \u201cHe\u2019s changed Mother\u2019s Day for me, and he\u2019s helped me through it. \u201d The anecdote captures Ms. Grubman\u2019s uniquely contentious place in New York\u2019s pantheon of characters. It\u2019s a cherished and heartwarming memory for the family, but viewed from the outside, it will be perceived as overprivileged and materialistic enough to inspire a thousand mean tweets. Was Ms. Grubman prepared for such a social media response? \u201cI\u2019ve been there,\u201d she said, sounding momentarily battle weary. \u201cI\u2019ve been beaten, I\u2019ve been killed in the media. But at this point in my life, my family, my kids and my clients are the most important people to me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628467.1291707}
