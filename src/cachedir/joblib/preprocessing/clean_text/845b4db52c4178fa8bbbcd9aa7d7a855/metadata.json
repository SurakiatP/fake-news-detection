This behavior was never more in evidence than The Washington Post \u2018s David Fahrenthold\u2019s account of a 1996 a ribbon-cutting held by the Association to Benefit Children for a nursery school, when Donald Trump showed up, sat down to appear to be a great supporter, and then left without leaving a donation: \\nAs Sopan Deb tweeted , \\n\u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 29, 2016 \\nFrank and Kathie Lee Gifford were big donors and it is no wonder Gifford was so shocked by Trump\u2019s presence. What had been exposed is that Trump\u2019s life is a sham, a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not. \\nAs Fahrenthold explains , \\nFor as long as he has been rich and famous, Donald Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public \u2014 even nationally televised \u2014 promises to give his own money away. It was, in large part, a facade. A months-long investigation by The Washington Post has not been able to verify many of Trump\u2019s boasts about his philanthropy. \\nThat philanthropist isn\u2019t the real Trump. The only person Trump visibly cares about is Donald Trump. He uses his Foundation to buy himself nice things, spending other peoples\u2019 money for luxury items and collectibles. When he does make donations, it is again, because he gives no money to his own Foundation, with other peoples\u2019 money. \\nFahrenthold says that the only donation of Trump\u2019s own money the paper could find from the period of 2008 to today, is a $10,000 \u201cgift to the Police Athletic League of New York City, in 2009.\u201d \\nFor a man as rich as Trump claims to be, $10,000 in eight years is nothing to brag about. Not that this stops the monumental, deadbeat hypocrite that is Donald Trump from bragging anyway.'"}, "time": 1742563535.3197339}
