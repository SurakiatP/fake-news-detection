This week has quite a few different influences astrologically and then of course the elections in the United States of America. So we have quite a few things sort of bouncing around. If I were to look at it just energetically, it goes up, down, up, down, up, down. \\nSo there is quite a bit happening and everything begins to calm down for the end of November 7 a little bit but then on November 8 , it actually calms out quite a bit. \\nSo what happens between now and the final outcome will be the Will Of The People and literally, again from a spiritual perspective, it is decided by all of Humanity. It is not just an election in a local spot. \\nSo the mass consciousness plays a role in determining how the future will play out in all areas of life. So the focus for this week is peace, no matter whom shall become the holder of any office anywhere that the focus shall be for Peace. That Peace is first and foremost. So keep Peace in your prayers. Try to live from a peaceful center. Sing your Oms or whatever else you want to put vibrationally in the ethers, maybe songs about Joy and Peace and Love and we\u2019ll see what happens next. \\nAlright Dear Ones. As always, thank you and my love to you. \\nChanneled by Rev. Terri Newlon SF Source www.TerriNewlon.com Nov. 2016 Share this:'"}, "time": 1742561767.6009054}
