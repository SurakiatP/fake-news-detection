Joe Seiwert commented on Facebook that an African-American singer who knelt while performing \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d at a Miami Heat game should \u201cgo back\u201d to where she claims as home. \\nSeiwert, R-Pretty Prairie, posted that comment and a longer follow-up on an anti-black meme that was originally posted to a pro-Donald Trump Facebook group and then shared by one of Seiwert\u2019s constituents. \\nSeiwert confirmed the comments were his and said he was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech, as he says the woman in the meme did when she wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and knelt while singing the anthem. \\n{snip} \\nThe photo in the meme is of Denasia Lawrence, a Miami social worker and, according to the Miami Sun-Sentinel, a part-time game-night employee of the Heat professional basketball team. The team has issued a statement saying team officials were unaware that Lawrence planned to protest when they asked her to sing the anthem at Friday\u2019s preseason game with the Philadelphia 76ers. \\n{snip} \\nTo which Seiwert responded: \u201cI am where I claim home and like it, they want to claim it and it is their right to go where ever they like, so if they don\u2019t like it here, I believe that their freedom completely allows them to go wherever they believe is more free and non racist if that\u2019s what they believe.\u201d \\nSeiwert said he didn\u2019t see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \\n\u201cI have a personal life besides a legislative life,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it was inappropriate; I don\u2019t believe so, because I said nothing derogatory. And I believe that (if) people are that upset with the national anthem, they can do whatever they want to on their own time, but when they\u2019re using it on national TV to make a statement, that\u2019s not right. \\n\u201cI said if she (Lawrence) doesn\u2019t like it here, then go where she would like it. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d he said. \\nAsked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are, Seiwert responded: \u201cBecause maybe there\u2019s other people who don\u2019t want their place changed.\u201d \\nHe also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race. \\n\u201cIt don\u2019t make any difference if they\u2019re black, white or green, it\u2019s the disrespect to our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd why does everybody put the color to it?\u201d \\n{snip} \\nThe person who made the meme took a photo of Lawrence from the web and added, in capital letters, \u201cKNEELING WHILE SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM . . . I\u2019M SO SICK OF THESE ANTI-AMERICAN BLACKS . . . (Expletive) BLACK LIVES MATTER.\u201d \\nSeiwert\u2019s comment, directed at Lawrence, was: \u201cGo back to where you claim home than (sic).\u201d \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742562073.6890445}
