Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor, was chatting amiably in his studio here on Sunday with Paul J. Manafort, Donald J. Trump\u2019s new campaign chief, reminiscing about Ronald Reagan as the seconds ticked down to airtime. Then the cameras switched on. Mr. Wallace\u2019s tone sharpened as he pressed Mr. Manafort about his lobbying work for a Filipino dictator and his description of Mr. Trump as playing a \u201cpart. \u201d One halting answer was dismissed with a sly Wallace riposte: \u201cForgive me, it does seem a little bit like spin. \u201d By the time Mr. Manafort removed his microphone, tweets were swirling about his uneven performance. Mr. Wallace, who compares interviews to   shot a glance at his producer: success. As Fox News grapples with how to cover Mr. Trump  \u2014   who has tested the network\u2019s influence and battled its anchors, even as he stokes its ratings  \u2014   Mr. Wallace has stood out as Fox\u2019s moderate, occasionally contrarian voice, irritating Mr. Trump with tough questions and, on occasion, tweaking his opinionated colleagues, too. When Mr. Trump pledged in an interview to act more presidential, Mr. Wallace parried: \u201cWhen are you going to start?\u201d Then there was the time he ticked off Roger Ailes, Fox\u2019s powerful chairman, after chastising the hosts of the network\u2019s morning show, \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d for their carping coverage of Senator Barack Obama in 2008. \u201cThey were very unhappy,\u201d Mr. Wallace recalled. \u201cI had called them out on the air. \u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a phrase that we all talk about, which is, \u2018You do not fire inside the tent.\u2019 That\u2019s the ultimate transgression in Roger Ailes\u2019s mind. \u201d Over eggs and tea here on Sunday, Mr. Wallace, whose \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d is experiencing its highest ratings since starting 20 years ago this week, did not hesitate to take his industry and even his network to task, saying that Mr. Trump has been granted too much exposure on cable news. \u201cIf we put Donald Trump on for a rally now, and it\u2019s going to spike our audience, it\u2019s pretty hard if you\u2019re a news executive to say no,\u201d he said. \u201cDid everybody do it too much? Yes. \u201d Mr. Wallace singled out CNN as a notable offender. Would he include Fox in that group? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he replied. And asked if Fox\u2019s   commentators, who often support the Republican nominee in presidential years, would rally around a Trump candidacy, Mr. Wallace laughed. \u201cThat\u2019ll test it, won\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019ll be interesting to see. \u201d Mr. Wallace, 68, is a registered Democrat  \u2014   in order to vote in local Washington elections, he explains  \u2014   and he spent decades as a correspondent on NBC and ABC before joining Fox in 2003. The move to Fox prompted him to review what he calls his \u201cunexamined assumptions\u201d about traditional network news. \u201cIf there\u2019s a story on   marriage, it\u2019s like this is a celebration of a new civil right,\u201d Mr. Wallace said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I disagree with that. What I\u2019m saying is there are two sides to the story, and I don\u2019t think, generally speaking, the broadcast networks will portray both sides evenly. \u201d Wry and punchy   Mr. Wallace has long had a rebellious streak. Bill Clinton accused him in an interview of having a \u201clittle smirk on your face\u201d Newt Gingrich goaded a crowd into mocking him at a 2011 debate President Obama\u2019s refusal to appear on his show prompted Mr. Wallace to describe his administration as \u201ccrybabies. \u201d (Mr. Obama ended his drought this month, in an interview that lured millions of viewers.) In the Fox studio in Washington on Sunday, Mr. Wallace could not resist making mischief. After grilling Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Mr. Wallace reassured her during a commercial break that the segment had gone fine. \u201cIt was clear you think Donald Trump sucks,\u201d Mr. Wallace said, earning a laugh from Ms. Schultz. Last summer, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Wallace for asking about his bankruptcies during the first Republican debate. \u201cThe son is only a tiny fraction of Mike, believe me,\u201d Mr. Trump said afterward. That would be Mr. Wallace\u2019s father, Mike Wallace, the famous correspondent whose legacy has been a complicated backdrop to his son\u2019s career. For years, the men were not close Chris Wallace still considers his stepfather, Bill Leonard, a former president of CBS News, as \u201cmore of a father than my father was. \u201d Mike Wallace once stole an interview, with the comedian Chris Rock, away from his son the two did not speak for several months. Chris Wallace said there was a time when Mr. Trump\u2019s remark might have bothered him, adding: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t anymore. \u201d \u201cAt some point, I realized, I was never going to be Mike Wallace, but neither was anybody else,\u201d he said. He and his father, who died in 2012, bonded later in life Mr. Wallace has also borrowed bits of his father\u2019s interviewing style, prefacing tough questions with a polite \u201cForgive me,\u201d and occasionally placing a deferential arm across his chest. \u201cHe\u2019s a dignified, smart, fairly quiet guy, who came up under a legend,\u201d Mr. Ailes said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s now pretty much achieved what his old man did. \u201d So what does Mr. Ailes make of Mr. Wallace\u2019s contention that news networks, including Fox, have   Mr. Trump? \u201cDid he get too much coverage? Yes,\u201d Mr. Ailes said, after a pause. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not just cable news, but all news. \u201d \u201cThe broadcast networks are just as guilty,\u201d Mr. Ailes added, noting that Mr. Trump, in addition to being the Republican   has been more accessible to the news media than his opponents. \u201cWhen you go try to drag another candidate to talk about another serious issue that day, he\u2019s not available,\u201d Mr. Ailes said. Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News, praised Mr. Wallace for his tough interviews and for refusing to allow Mr. Trump to phone in to his Sunday show, an accommodation made by some other networks. He noted that Mr. Wallace\u2019s journalistic reputation provided another benefit to Fox. \u201cPart of the brilliance of Ailes is he has a few people like that he can point to, and say, \u2018What do you mean we are the official spokesman of the Republican Party? That\u2019s ridiculous,\u2019\u201d Mr. Heyward said. \u201cHe\u2019s his own man,\u201d Mr. Heyward said of Mr. Wallace. \u201cAnd that works for Roger, too. \u201d (Mr. Ailes said in response: \u201cIt\u2019s amusing to me to hear that one person I picked has made this all work. \u2019\u2019) Over lunch, Mr. Wallace said that some of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior had taken politics \u201cto new depths, and I think it\u2019s sad. \u201d \u201cI understand the need to entertain, but I think it would suit him, and serve democracy, if it was conducted on a higher plane,\u201d he said. That hasn\u2019t stopped Mr. Wallace from displaying a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, signed by Mr. Trump, among the mementos in his office. (Also on display: his father\u2019s old Rolodex.) \u201cIt\u2019s a great hat,\u201d he said, urging a reporter to try it on. His brow arched, he said he likes to wear it while visiting one of his daughters, \u201ca raving liberal,\u201d in New York. Why? \u201cI knew it would really tick her off. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562250.8184016}
