The people were returning from Arba\u2019een mourning rituals in the holy city of Karbala. \\n\u201cAt least seven buses with pilgrims were inside the petrol station at the time,\u201d an unnamed police lieutenant colonel told AFP.

Ambulances and civil defense are on their way to the site.\u201d \\nThe Takfiri Daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing. \\nIn recent weeks, Daesh has resorted to similar acts of violence in areas outside its control in a desperate attempt to undermine a large Iraqi battle aimed at liberating the northern city of Mosul, the terror group\u2019s last remaining foothold in the country. \\n\u2018Iran won\u2019t waver in backing Iraq\u2019 \\nHours after the incident, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly condemned the fatal terrorist blast, expressing sympathy with the Iraqi government and nation as well as all the families of the victims. \\nTouching on reports that Iranian citizens were among the victims, Bahram Qassemi said, \u201cThe Foreign Ministry and the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s Embassy in Baghdad are investigating the issue with seriousness\u201d and will take necessary measures in that regard. \\nThe Iranian official also stressed that such pre-planned and savage assaults emanate from the desperation of the terrorists, who are taking successive blows on the battlefield. \\n\u201cThese brutal and inhumane acts will not affect the Iraqi government and nation\u2019s determination and the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s support for the oppressed Iraqi people in the unrelenting fight against terrorism,\u201d Qassemi said.
