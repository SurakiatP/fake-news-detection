And It\u2019s easy enough to see the video online of Trump mocking  \u2014   you just showed it  \u2014   I completely agree with Meryl. It was heartbreaking moment and so beneath the dignity of the presidency, let alone any respectful person. What we need more is kindness and common decency. And what he did, how he reacted and how he needs  \u2014   he has the need to talk back and insult anybody who doesn\u2019t agree with him, and that\u2019s pretty disgraceful. \u201d She continued, \u201cWhat\u2019s the signal to little children who watch television and see this behavior of the soon to be president of the United States? Little girls were heartbroken when Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t get to to be president. So I think it\u2019s what they see. Children will listen, I sang that in a song once,  and you know they will see and they will learn. And you know I\u2019m in the middle of having my teeth cleaned. You caught me at a disadvantage. \u201d She added, \u201cThat is why you cant trust anything he says because if you get on his wrong side, he will blast you negatively  \u2026     He had a New Year\u2019s Eve party, but he wasn\u2019t  generous to give that to his followers as a president. He had to charge for it  and put that money into this club. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little strange?\u201d She concluded, \u201cI was very proud of her. She\u2019s a wonderful actress and that he had to denigrate her talent because she spoke out. Why is he not sitting through briefings rather then tweeting this nonsense and rating wars with Arnold Schwarzenegger? I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to take four years of this. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564579.6037989}
