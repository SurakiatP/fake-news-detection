Farrell could not possibly have known who would be president on the day his fine book was published. That it happens to be Donald J. Trump is, for him, an extraordinary stroke of luck. To read this biography with an eye only toward the parallels between the two presidents would be lazy and unfair, a disservice to Farrell\u2019s nuanced scholarship. But the context here is unignorable. The similarities between Nixon and Trump leap off the page like crickets. There is, first and most superficially, their nonpresidential looks  \u2014   Trump with his roosterly combover, Nixon with jowls so low they formed an   with his nose. More substantively, there\u2019s the matter of their Old Testament fury at the news media. (\u201cThe press is the enemy,\u201d Nixon told his aides. \u201cWrite that on the blackboard 100 times and never forget it. \u201d) What else? Their thin skin. Their skyscraping paranoia. Their cavernous memory for slights. It\u2019s hard to think of two modern presidents with a more dire case of political hemophilia. Once wounded, these men never stop bleeding. Like Trump, Nixon was a monomaniac on the stump, obsessed with the enemies lurking within. Nixon, too, had a penchant for sowing mayhem and a gourmand\u2019s appetite for revenge, especially in the wee hours of the morning. (Trump tweets. Nixon made phone calls.) And members of Nixon\u2019s own party feared for his stability. As vice president, he once flew into a rage after contending with a group of hostile student journalists at Cornell University. \u201cWhat scares the hell out of me is that you would blow sky high over a thing as inconsequential as this,\u201d an adviser told him. \u201cWhat in goddamn would you do if you were president and get into a really bad situation?\u201d These similarities in character lead to eerily similar behavioral consequences. In 1968, Nixon opened up a back channel to the president of South Vietnam, assuring him he\u2019d get further support if he could just hold out for a Nixon presidency and resist Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s offers to broker peace. Nearly 50 years later, Michael Flynn had private discussions with the Russians that seemed to promise them a friendlier American policy  \u2014   if they could just sit tight until Trump was inaugurated. Both men went on to claim that their predecessors had wiretapped these discussions. Nixon said he\u2019d been tipped off by J. Edgar Hoover. Confirmation of Nixon\u2019s meddling in Johnson\u2019s peace efforts is the only real news that \u201cRichard Nixon\u201d breaks. But startling revelations are hardly the only criterion for a good Nixon biography. He\u2019s an electrifying subject, a muttering Lear, of perennial interest to anyone with even an average curiosity about politics or psychology. The real test of a good Nixon biography, given how many there are, is far simpler: Is it elegantly written? And, even more important, can it tolerate paradoxes and complexity, the spikier stuff that distinguishes   sinners from   villains? The answer, in the case of \u201cRichard Nixon,\u201d is yes, on both counts. Farrell has a liquid style that slips easily down the gullet, and he understands all too well that Nixon was a vat of contradictions. Some readers may find Farrell\u2019s portrait too sympathetic  \u2014   he\u2019s as apt to describe Nixon as a tortured depressive as he is to call him a malevolent sneak  \u2014   but more readers, I think, will find this book complicating and  . It\u2019s also hard to read a   history of a president\u2019s life without feeling like you\u2019re crawling over the dense folds of an accordion. But most chapters in \u201cRichard Nixon\u201d have room to breathe. The development of Nixon\u2019s character in this book is subtle. He doesn\u2019t start out as a rampaging narcissist and megalomaniac. Over time, it was power combined with profound insecurity that misshaped him. He had no ability to tolerate the slings and arrows of outrageous public humiliations, of which he probably suffered a disproportionate many, and he responded with the venom of a toadfish. The press trolled him. Even Dwight D. Eisenhower trolled him. Once, Ike was asked to name an important decision Nixon had helped him make as his vice president. \u201cIf you give me a week, I might think of one,\u201d he replied. Farrell follows a mostly chronological structure. We go to Whittier, Calif. where Nixon was raised by an ogre of a father, a fellow so bad at farming he couldn\u2019t grow lemons. As a young man, Nixon was awkward, square, hopeless at making small talk. I could read a whole book of his love letters to Pat, his future wife. They\u2019re endearing and pathetic, the desperate pleas of the runt of the litter. \u201cYes, I know I\u2019m crazy!\u201d he wrote in a note he shoved under her door. \u201cAnd that   \u2026     I don\u2019t take hints, but you see, Miss Pat, I like you!\u201d In some ways, the Watergate years, because they\u2019re so familiar, are the least interesting stretch of this book. (Though here\u2019s a detail I\u2019d forgotten: Nixon had a mole in almost every opponent\u2019s campaign, a thumb in every pie.) It\u2019s Farrell\u2019s chapters about race that prove the most textured and dizzying: It was over this issue that the president\u2019s Quaker upbringing and Machiavellian impulses seemed most overtly at war. When Nixon first ran for Congress, he was made an honorary member of the local N. A. A. C. P. so progressive was he on matters of race. Yet while running for president, he made it clear he\u2019d \u201clay off   crap,\u201d and once in office he mastered the rhetorical art of exploiting racial grievances. Thus began the South\u2019s transformation from a block of   states to a G. O. P. sea. You can also draw a through line from Nixon\u2019s contempt for the liberal elite to Trump\u2019s boastful claims of political incorrectness. That vaudevillian public disdain for East Coast intellectuals, Ivy League blue bloods, cosmopolites  \u2014   all of it started with Nixon. It was he who first used the phrase \u201cthe silent majority. \u201d He came by that populism honestly. He started from nothing, and he found the culture of Washington, which went gaga over pretty, privileged boys like John F. Kennedy, infuriating. What his populism didn\u2019t mean, however, was stripping the welfare state to the studs. The public still had a taste for big government back then. During Nixon\u2019s presidency, he signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act and established the Environmental Protection Agency. The most charitable biographies paint Nixon as a tragic figure, and that\u2019s precisely what the president is here. Farrell\u2019s Nixon is smart and ambitious, a visionary in some ways (China) but also skinless, both driven and utterly undone by  . It may be the way he differs most, at least psychologically, from our current president. Trump has shown almost no evidence of   ever, about anything. He appears to sail through life unencumbered by introspection. He\u2019d yield no more depth if you used an oil rig. But grandiosity and profound insecurity often find the same form of public expression: recklessness. \u201cI sometimes had the impression that he invited crisis and that he couldn\u2019t stand normalcy,\u201d Henry Kissinger once said. I\u2019ll leave it up to the reader to determine which president he\u2019s best describing.'"}, "time": 1742562011.1510797}
