Trump the Republican presidential nomination, was already fraying almost to the point of irrelevance on Monday, only hours after it was announced to great fanfare. With the pact, the two candidates agreed to cede forthcoming primary contests to each other. Mr. Kasich would, most crucially, stand down in Indiana\u2019s primary on May 3 to give Mr. Cruz a better chance to defeat Mr. Trump there, while Mr. Cruz would leave Oregon and New Mexico to Mr. Kasich. It appeared to be a measure of last resort, but initially it seemed like a breakthrough. Mr. Cruz trumpeted what he called the \u201cbig news\u201d in Indiana, a state that appears pivotal to stopping Mr. Trump from winning a majority of delegates. \u201cJohn Kasich has decided to pull out of Indiana to give us a    contest with Donald Trump,\u201d he said. But at his own campaign stop in Philadelphia on Monday, Mr. Kasich tamped down Mr. Cruz\u2019s triumphalism. Voters in Indiana, Mr. Kasich said, \u201cought to vote for me,\u201d even if he would not be campaigning publicly there. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t see this as any big deal. \u201d Under the best of circumstances, the arrangement between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich would seem to be a long shot  \u2014   more of an expedient to stop Mr. Trump from taking a big step toward winning the nomination next week in Indiana than a permanent joining of forces. Far from forming any kind of unity ticket, Mr. Trump\u2019s surviving challengers have both vowed to triumph in an open convention in Cleveland, and they remain irreconcilable on key matters of policy. Their agreement dealt only with three states, leaving an open question as to how directly they might compete with each other everywhere else. Even in Indiana, emerging as the most important state, the   pact appeared something less than decisive. While Mr. Kasich\u2019s campaign canceled his public appearances in the state, the governor was still slated to visit Indianapolis on Tuesday for a   event at the Columbia Club. And he still had meetings scheduled with a series of Indiana Republicans, including Gov. Mike Pence, according to a leading Republican in the state. Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign privately advised supporters on Sunday not to endorse tactical voting, whereby his supporters might switch their allegiance to Mr. Kasich in states where the Ohio governor is running stronger against Mr. Trump. \u201cWe never tell voters who to vote for,\u201d read the suggested Cruz talking point. \u201cWe\u2019re simply letting folks know where we will be focusing our time and resources. \u201d Mr. Trump, who has taunted his opponents throughout the race for their Keystone Kops approach to undermining his campaign, seemed to relish the continuing strain between his remaining rivals. On Twitter, he mocked \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted Cruz\u201d and \u201c1 for 38 Kasich,\u201d referring to the latter\u2019s dismal winning record in the Republican race, for being unable to beat him on their own. \u201cSo they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cShows weakness!\u201d At a campaign rally in Rhode Island, Mr. Trump boasted that his opponents were united against him, and said he welcomed their \u201ccollusion. \u201d \u201cActually I was happy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it shows how weak they are. \u201d Allies of both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich did not exactly disagree with that assessment, and acknowledged that the prospect of imminent disaster in Indiana had been the impetus to reach their deal, such as it is. Still, aides to Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich seem acutely aware that they risk turning off voters who find the arrangement unseemly. Even before his rivals\u2019 agreement, Mr. Trump had complained repeatedly that the nominating process was \u201crigged\u201d against him. With Mr. Trump expected to win all five of the East Coast states that vote on Tuesday, the next opportunity to slow his campaign will come a week later in Indiana. Republicans believe he must be stopped there if they are to deny him the nomination. \u201cIndiana is a   for Ted Cruz, and it\u2019s a   for anybody who doesn\u2019t think Donald Trump should be the nominee,\u201d said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative group opposed to Mr. Trump and supportive of Mr. Cruz. The group is airing an ad in Indiana urging voters to vote for Mr. Cruz, not Mr. Kasich, to stop Mr. Trump, and officials said they intended to keep it on the air despite the agreement. On Monday, Trusted Leadership PAC, a group supporting Mr. Cruz, said it also planned to keep a previously announced attack ad against Mr. Kasich on the air in Indiana. The group added, though, that it had shelved advertising plans in New Mexico and Oregon. Charles R. Black Jr. an adviser to Mr. Kasich, said it would be helpful to his candidate  \u2014   and \u201ca big blow to Trump\u201d  \u2014   for Mr. Cruz to win Indiana. The point of announcing the deal, Mr. Black said, was to indicate to outside \u201csuper PACs\u201d where the campaigns and candidates were marshaling their resources. Mr. Black played down the degree to which voters would cast their ballots strategically, switching allegiance between candidates to thwart Mr. Trump. \u201cEither the guy gets to 1, 237 or he doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cVoters don\u2019t focus on this tactical, inside baseball stuff. \u201d For months, rivals of the Republican   have claimed that he has succeeded only because the   vote has been spread among so many alternative candidates. That argument appeared to falter in New York last week, when Mr. Trump won 60 percent of the vote and captured nearly all of the state\u2019s delegates. Now that each of them has been granted a cleaner shot against Mr. Trump  \u2014   in different states, and at different moments over the next few weeks  \u2014   Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich will have no easy excuse if Mr. Trump continues to prevail. While Mr. Cruz faces the more immediate test in Indiana, Mr. Kasich will have to make swift use of his free hand in Oregon. Though the state\u2019s primary date is May 17, the election there is conducted by mail, and voters will begin to receive their ballots this week. Ron Saxton, a prominent Kasich supporter in Oregon, said the deal \u201cputs more pressure\u201d on Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz to perform strongly against Mr. Trump. But Mr. Saxton, a former Republican candidate for governor, said there was catching up to do in his state. \u201cNone of the three G. O. P. campaigns have any real Oregon visibility yet, just the national press,\u201d Mr. Saxton wrote in an email. \u201cSince Cruz\u2019s name remains on the ballot, my guess is that he\u2019ll get close to the same votes he\u2019d get if he hadn\u2019t \u2018withdrawn.\u2019 Is he going to actively encourage his supporters to vote for Kasich?\u201d On Monday, both candidates swatted away questions about whether the deal was something of an underhanded ploy. Mr. Cruz said the agreement was aimed at empowering   voters against the   denying that the effort to stop Mr. Trump was subverting the will of the people. \u201cThis is entirely about the will of the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about winning the votes of the Hoosier State. \u201d Mr. Kasich, in Pennsylvania, grew quickly agitated at the suggestion that his deal with Mr. Cruz reflected desperation. \u201cMe? No, I\u2019m not desperate  \u2014   are you?\u201d he asked a reporter. \u201cAre you desperate?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564331.564689}
