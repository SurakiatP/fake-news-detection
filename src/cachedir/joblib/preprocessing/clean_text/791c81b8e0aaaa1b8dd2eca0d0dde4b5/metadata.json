She had the hallway fights, suspensions and detention to prove it. Early in Ms. Davis\u2019s high school career, her father was incarcerated on manslaughter charges. \u201cI was just angry,\u201d Ms. Davis, 18, recalled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t talk to anybody. I wasn\u2019t feeling good about anything. \u201d Academics were no longer a priority she shut everyone out. And if pressed on anything, she said, she would pick fights with classmates. Ms. Davis got a bad reputation at school, and said it was not long before teachers simply assumed she was to blame for any confrontation. Everyone else went unpunished, she said. Her principal at Frederick Douglass Academy in West Harlem suggested she might benefit from transferring to a different school, one designed for students who struggle in more traditional education settings. Her boyfriend had attended such a school, and compared the experience to being surrounded by a supportive family. \u201cA family at school?\u201d she recalled telling her boyfriend. \u201cI\u2019m not really into people that much. \u201d But in September 2015, Ms. Davis took a chance and enrolled at the Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service, a transfer school for students who are falling short of the credits they need to graduate. The school is a joint venture between New York City\u2019s Education Department and Brooklyn Community Services, one of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund\u2019s eight beneficiary organizations. \u201cI just felt like I wasn\u2019t that excited about school anymore,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exciting to me anymore, until I came to Leadership. \u201d At her new school, she received support from teachers who were compassionate and understanding and knew every student by name. She was also assigned an advocate counselor, who was on call to help with problems Ms. Davis had outside school. It became clear, she said, that Leadership was going to be a different kind of place to learn. \u201cI have to do better,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be like my old school. It has to be different. \u201d Her classmates became friends, not targets of fights. After she became pregnant last year and the pregnancy started to show, teachers and students did not judge her as she walked the halls, she said. Instead, they fawned over her baby bump and wanted to know about her baby shower. Ms. Davis gave birth to her son, Kyree Cooper, in July. \u201cThere\u2019s not one day he doesn\u2019t make me happy,\u201d she said. Recently, she moved out of a home in Brownsville, Brooklyn, where she had lived with the grandmother who raised her. She moved in with Kyree\u2019s father and grandfather. It was important that Ms. Davis\u2019s grandmother not feel pressure to raise Kyree, she said. Ms. Davis earns money through a   internship with Educational Video Center, a program run by the Leadership school. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be depending on anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if it isn\u2019t the most money in the world, I want to get things for myself that I purchased with my   money. \u201d Brooklyn Community Services has continued to help. Recently, it used $300 in Neediest Cases funds to buy winter clothing for Ms. Davis and Kyree. Ms. Davis is on track to graduate by March. And she has fixed her sights on a career as an ultrasound technician. \u201cAfter becoming pregnant, I felt that job was a good job,\u201d she said. \u201cI can be part of other people\u2019s milestones, see their baby\u2019s heartbeat for the first time. \u201d Newfound independence has so far proved more liberating than frightening. Even with the pitfalls of parenting she knows she will encounter, she said, she is determined to evolve and improve with each challenge she surmounts. \u201cI just want to experience stuff on my own,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cI want to make mistakes on my own. I know how it is having a parent saying, \u2018That\u2019s not how you do it.\u2019 I want to learn that\u2019s not how you do it. I want to try new things and be different. \u201d About her son, she said, \u201cI want to raise him the way I want to raise him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562675.71664}
