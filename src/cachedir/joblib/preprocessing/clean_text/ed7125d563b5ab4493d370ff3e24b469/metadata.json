An alert from the National Hurricane Center at 2 p. m. on Sept. 22 noted that a tropical wave had been detected moving off the west coast of Africa but gave it little likelihood of developing into a major storm. Still, develop it did, becoming a textbook example of how storms follow no textbook. It then mushroomed into the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic since Hurricane Felix in 2007, killing, by some estimates, more than 800 people in Haiti, slamming into the Bahamas and then skirting a razor\u2019s edge that, had it been a few miles south and west, could have caused catastrophic damage in Florida. By Saturday, it was barely a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, but it still had the potential to bring heavy rain and flooding to the Carolinas. Dieulifaite Derlus, Maria Ageeb, Ed Kelley and Todd Neville had nothing in common  \u2014   until the storm hit, leaving behind stories of disaster and disaster narrowly averted. Here are some of them. His family safe, Mr. Derlus carefully retraced his steps atop the back wall behind his home on Tuesday, making one final trip to save a few valuables. But the wind was too strong, knocking him off the ledge and into the rush of muddy water below. Before he could get up, the wall fell, too, unable to withstand the  . p. h. gusts. It toppled right on top of him. Neighbors spotted Mr. Derlus, 62, and carried him, semiconscious, from hospital to hospital. Each one turned him away. There were no doctors to help. As he approached the third hospital, he died in the neighbors\u2019 arms. \u201cHe was the pillar of our family,\u201d said Maude Levius, his wife, holed up with their five children in the one room of the house that was not destroyed. They don\u2019t know where they will bury him, or how they will pay for it. Their furniture, clothes and other possessions were washed away in the storm. \u201cWe have no idea what we\u2019re going to do now,\u201d Ms. Levius, 56, said. Mr. Derlus was the family\u2019s sole bread winner, his job as a driver for a government agency providing for all seven of them. \u201cI don\u2019t know how God will provide for us. \u201d When the shingles started popping off the roof and she realized she could not make it to the main house, Ms. Ageeb thought she knew where she would be safe  \u2014   in the bathroom of the   apartment where she lived behind the house where she and her three brothers had grown up. Ms. Ageeb, 34, a lawyer, recalled what happened next on Thursday around 11 a. m. as the peak of the storm\u2019s fury was hitting. \u201cSuddenly, half of the ceiling just lifted up and blew right off,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, I had already packed my passport and valuables in a backpack, just in case. All I had to do was grab it and go. \u201d She fought her way down the external stairs in the middle of winds nearing 140 m. p. h. and was sure at one point that she would be blown away. \u201cThe wind started pushing me from side to side,\u201d she said. \u201cIt almost pulled my glasses off my face and I stumbled, trying to grab hold of them, because without them, I\u2019m blind. I made it to the bottom, and my brothers helped me. \u201d From their house, they watched as the other half of the roof was blown away and everything she owned was exposed to the storm. Ms. Ageeb\u2019s home is one of many that were badly damaged in the area. Homes, shops and service stations lost roofs and windows, sea walls collapsed and several areas were severe flooded. There has been no official report of the extent of the damage. Ms. Ageeb captured the aftermath on a video. \u201cI can\u2019t stop shaking,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI\u2019m still a nervous wreck. I just want this to stop so we can just get on with cleaning up and trying to see what we can salvage. \u201d \u201cOur country, this island, is going to need a lot of help,\u201d Ms. Ageeb added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always helped all the other islands, and I think this time now we\u2019re definitely going to need help. I don\u2019t know from who or from where, but we\u2019re definitely going to need help. \u201d The authorities in Volusia County were urging people to evacuate from their beachfront communities. The storm was lurking, threatening, frightening. But for a time, Mr. Kelley, the mayor of Ormond Beach, had no plans to leave. \u201cOriginally, we weren\u2019t going to board it up,\u201d Mr. Kelley said of his home, which is a few miles inland and not far from Daytona Beach, the typically   stock car racing hub. \u201cWe just thought we\u2019d take a chance. \u201d But Mr. Kelley ultimately had a realization, pushed along by the demands of his children: Maybe, as a local government official, he should follow the recommendations of a local government. \u201cWhy are we telling people to leave? Because it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Mr. Kelley said. \u201cWhen did you decide? When you start thinking: \u2018Well, we\u2019re telling everybody else to leave. Why am I here? \u2019\u201d So, he concluded, \u201cWe actually heeded the advice that was given by us and others. \u201d By the time Mr. Kelley left the city on Thursday, he said that he had also recognized that the storm might leave him out of reach at a perilous moment for Ormond Beach, a city of about 41, 000 where the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller used to spend winters. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was going to do staying there because we knew, absolutely, that we were going to lose power,\u201d Mr. Kelley said in an interview from Gainesville, where he had taken refuge and, by Friday afternoon, acknowledged that an evacuation had been a wise choice. \u201cThe preparations were done,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no decision that I would have had to make that couldn\u2019t have been from here. \u201d Mr. Neville, an accountant in St. Augustine, watched the damage unfold. As water rushed into his city, he glimpsed a partly submerged white sport utility vehicle. He listened as the palm trees twisted and as the rain pounded a roof. But Mr. Neville was nowhere near St. Augustine. Instead, from a haven on the other side of the state, he used his cellphone to watch the ravaging of a    city in real time. It is one way technology is taking at least some of the uncertainty out of disastrous storms. You cannot control the weather, but you can see its damage even when you\u2019re elsewhere. Mr. Neville\u2019s ability to keep watch on St. Augustine was born of gadgetry and fraternity: The images that poured onto his cellphone often came from surveillance cameras that he and other members of his regular Friday morning breakfast group at Georgie\u2019s Diner had installed at their homes and offices. On the Friday morning when Hurricane Matthew passed about 30 miles from St. Augustine, Mr. Neville was safe and dry near Tampa. The updates still flowed. There was the panning video from a jeweler that showed nature\u2019s disconcerting powers, and an image from a friend named Chris that showed the floodwaters rising around the pumps of a Shell gas station that shares a parking lot with Georgie\u2019s. Yet Mr. Neville said he knew the destruction could have been far worse in a city that was the capital of Florida before it was a state. It would have been worse, Mr. Neville knew, had some forecasts held and the storm edged any closer to land. \u201cI remember looking at the 5 a. m. update and thinking, \u2018Thank goodness it\u2019s 35 miles offshore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Neville said. \u201cUntil that 5 a. m. update, for the last three days, we\u2019ve had the bull\u2019  on us. \u201d St. Augustine is a city accustomed to storms and floodwaters: St. Johns County, of which St. Augustine is the seat, notes on its website that residents are reminded annually \u201cof the vulnerability of our coastal community. \u201d But Hurricane Matthew\u2019s timing was especially worrisome. \u201cIt hit St. Augustine right at high tide,\u201d Mr. Neville said. \u201cDuring a   high tide, we\u2019ll get minor flooding just from that. And then you throw in a   storm surge, and it\u2019s unbelievable. \u201d But technology has its limits. As the storm reached peak intensity on Friday, the power went out and the battery backups blinked off. As night fell across Florida on Friday, Mr. Neville\u2019s surveillance camera had not switched on again.'"}, "time": 1742562137.6585765}
