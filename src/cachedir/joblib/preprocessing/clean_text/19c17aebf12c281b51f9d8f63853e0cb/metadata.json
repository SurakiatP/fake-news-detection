[\u201cI want to emphasize that Linda\u2019s statements on social media and at rallies are Linda\u2019s \u2014   she owns them,\u201d Rory Lancman  \u2014   a member of the New York City Council from Queens  \u2014   told the Algemeiner. \u201cThey have a history of antisemitism, of    \u2014   if you can believe that is something someone would still traffic in, in 2017  \u2014   and of hostility and threats towards people who disagree with her. \u201d  Lancman told the Algemeiner that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for CUNY\u2019s Graduate School of Public Health to host Sarsour, a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions activist (BDS) given her statements against Jews and other women. In the past, Sarsour has tweeted that \u201cnothing is creepier than Zionism\u201d and said that   writers Brigitte Gabriel and Ayaan Hirsi Ali deserve an \u201ca$$ whipping\u201d and that she wishes she could have their \u201cvaginas taken away\u201d for their opposition to Sharia law, which she supports: Twitter is forever: Women\u2019s March leader Linda Sarsour wants to grab Ayaan Hirsi Ali by the p*ssy. pic. twitter.   \u2014   SHIREEN QUDOSI (@ShireenQudosi) January 26, 2017,  Yet Sarsour has many progressive supporters who reportedly insist she is the victim of   advocates. Despite her   rhetoric, the TAlgemeiner reported that, at a small rally organized by progressive groups in Lower Manhattan on Monday, speakers rejected the allegation that Sarsour is an antisemite. In an   for the Daily News, leftist Rabbis Barat Ellman and Ellen Lippmann argued, \u201cLinda Sarsour is a friend to Jews. \u201d They wrote, \u201cYes, Sarsour is an ardent critic of Zionism  \u2014   which should come as no surprise for a   with relatives in Palestine. But she has been clear that it is   Zionism  \u2014   Zionism that dismisses Palestinian claims to a national identity or for statehood  \u2014   that she vehemently opposes. \u201d Zionism is the belief that Israel is the established and rightful homeland of the Jews. The rabbi duo then goes on to suggest, \u201cSarsour\u2019s retort  \u2014   that Ali and others she disagrees with \u2018don\u2019t deserve to be women,\u2019 so she wishes she could \u2018take their vaginas away\u2019  \u2014   was written in anger, and we agree it wasn\u2019t nice,\u201d adding, \u201cBut it was not meant to be taken literally, and is hardly proof that she wants to assault Muslims who disagree with her or surgically strike women\u2019s bodies. \u201d In conclusion, Ellman and Lippmann said, \u201cCUNY wants to honor a leader at commencement. We say amen. \u201d Lancman told the Algemeiner, \u201cThat whole   was an absurd whitewash, and that sentence in particular. It was embarrassing for anyone who purports to be involved with women\u2019s rights. \u201d Democrat New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind ( ) has also been critical of Sarsour. He created a video asking her to answer questions about her troubling statements and associations. In addition to the noted statements, he asked Sarsour, \u201cYou think this is a courageous act to pick up rocks and throw them at cars?\u201d in response to Sarsour\u2019s tweet: The definition of courage. #Palestine pic. twitter.   \u2014   Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) October 12, 2015,  Hikind noted that those rocks have seriously injured people and killed people in cars. In 2013, a    girl died after the car she was in was attacked by rocks. Adele Biton was in a coma for two years before succumbing to her injuries and developing pneumonia.
