As he wrote on his Facebook, 'I've known him for over 20 years, we are friends. I predicted this cautiously. It's a strong personality with unpredictable policy. We should be more careful and organized than ever'.Donald Trump has won the US presidential elections. Mikheil Saakashvili was a president himself in Georgia. And resigned as a Governor of the Odessa region the other day. It should be recollected that the Ukrainian authorities tried to help the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at these elections. In summer the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Bureau opened investigation against ex-chairman of Trump's presidential campaign Paul Manafort who had allegedly got some millions dollars from former ruling Party of Regions. Petro Poroshenko in his turn hoped that whoever came to power in the US after elections, Kiev would still get support.Poroshenko's Administration also sent a request for a meeting with Trump at the UN General Assembly during Poroshenko's being in New York.
