Griffee / November 7, 2016 / POLITICS / A focus group of 23 people put together by CBS News revealed a frightening look at what America has become \u2013 a divided nation. \\nRepublican pollster, public opinion analyst and CBS News consultant Frank Luntz interviewed the group, and even lost it himself during the heated discussion. He came away deeply disturbed by what he saw. \\nWhether they were Republicans or Democrats, supporting Trump or Clinton, they were all angry. Out of the 23 people, only 3 raised their hands saying they were voting for a candidate. The others were voting just to vote against a candidate. \\n\u201cWhen we don\u2019t agree on the same facts, how can we possibly agree on the same solutions?\u201d Luntz asked. \\nMy \u201cangry voter\u201d focus group will be on @60Minutes tonight. \\nFirst time I\u2019ve ever lost my composure during a group. \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/6vUNsSVLEb \\n\u2014 Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) November 6, 2016 How many of you are voting against a candidate?
