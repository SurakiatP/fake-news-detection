[W]e are all not only complicit in, but actively perpetuating white supremacy,\u201d states an advertisement for the group. \u201cPretending that we are not racist and hoping that no one will discover our racism really doesn\u2019t cut it. [W]e need to ACTIVELY be doing work to deconstruct our whiteness (and holding our peers accountable in doing the same).\u201d \\n\u201cRecognizing that White identity is a self-fashioned, hierarchical fantasy, Whites should attempt to dismantle Whiteness as it currently exists,\u201d explains the group\u2019s Facebook page , quoting Ian Haney L\u00f3pez, a leading racial justice scholar. \u201cWhites should renounce their privileged racial character, though not simply out of guilt or any sense of self-deprecation. Rather, they should dismantle the edifice of Whiteness because this mythological construct stands at the vortex of racial inequality in America.\u201d \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742562286.172755}
