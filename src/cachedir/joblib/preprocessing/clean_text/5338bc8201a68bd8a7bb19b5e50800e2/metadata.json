[During a Westwood One radio broadcast with Jim Gray before the Super Bowl, Trump was asked whether he would allow his son Barron, or any of his grandchildren to play football.  \u201cIf they wanted, I would allow them to play,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I will say that they have to be very careful. \u201d Trump\u2019s answer is different than former President Obama  \u2014   who regularly signaled that if he had a son, he would probably not allow him to play in the sport. \u201cI would not let my son play pro football,\u201d Obama said, in 2014. But Trump remarked that he played football \u201cat a certain level\u201d while growing up and appreciated the toughness of the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s a rough game and it\u2019s a tough game and there\u2019s something really good about that in terms of competition, and learning how to compete and win,\u201d he said. Trump acknowledged that some parents were keeping their children out of football, but he would let the children in his family decide for themselves. \u201cRegardless, I would leave it up to the young person in the family, I think I would have to do that,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628511.129359}
