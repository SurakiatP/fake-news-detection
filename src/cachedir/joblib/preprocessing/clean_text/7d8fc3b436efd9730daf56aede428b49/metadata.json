Michael Flynn, who resigned as President Donald Trump\u2019s national security advisor last week. [Schiff, the top Democrat on both the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Benghazi, plans to question Flynn on his communication with Russia should he be forced to testify before Congress.  \u201cI\u2019d like to ask him whether that conversation he had with the Russian ambassador was a   conversation or there were others? Who in the White House instructed him to have those conversations? Whether he debriefed people in the administration after those conversations? ,\u201d Schiff said during a Sunday interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201d He added, \u201cEssentially, who was aware that he had reported falsely to the vice president, and then the vice president, in turn, had misled the American people?\u201d Reports alleging that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence on discussions he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took office surfaced in the media. However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) ruled out any charges against him, \u201cbarring new information that changes what they know. \u201d Last week, 20 Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee penned a letter to the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Ed Royce ( ) urging him to call on Flynn to testify before them. \u201cWe believe General Flynn must appear before the Committee, under oath as soon as possible,\u201d they wrote. \u201cGeneral Flynn\u2019s resignation leaves many questions unanswered about his and President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and wether American national security and intelligence operations have been compromised. \u201d The letter was signed by Democratic Reps. David Cicilline ( ) Brad Sherman ( ) Gregory Meeks ( ) Albio Sires ( ) Gerald Connolly ( ) Theodore Deutch ( ) Karen Bass ( ) William Keating ( ) Ami Bera ( ) Lois Frankel ( ) Joaqu\u00edn Castro ( ) Robin Kelly ( ) Brendan Boyle ( ) Dina Titus ( ) Norma Torres ( ) Thomas Suozzi ( ) Adriano Espaillat ( ) Ted Lieu ( ) Bradley Schneider ( ) and Tulsi Gabbard( ). In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Friday, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R. ) a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Flynn was treated unfairly  \u2014   and perhaps illegally  \u2014   in the scandal that forced his resignation as Trump\u2019s National Security Advisor. President Trump has consistently denied attempts to tie him to Russia. In October, following months of investigation into suspected foreign meddling in the U. S. election, Breitbart News reported that the FBI determined Trump did not have ties to the Russian government.
