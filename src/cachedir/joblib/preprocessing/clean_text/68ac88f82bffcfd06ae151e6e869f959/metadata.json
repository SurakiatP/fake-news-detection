For moments, viewers around the country heard only silence, and then the sounds of the anchor struggling to compose himself. \u201cThat was horrible,\u201d Mr. Cooper recalled, a bit sheepishly, in an interview on Wednesday. Accustomed to covering foreign wars and lethal hurricanes, Mr. Cooper said he did not like to show his feelings on camera. But this time, he added, felt different: \u201cI\u2019ve been surprised at how emotional this has been. \u201d As the news industry descended on Florida this week in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a gay nightclub, Mr. Cooper\u2019s raw,   coverage has stood out. He has held a   vigil of sorts, reciting a list of the dead refused to name the gunman, saying he wanted to focus on victims and, in a widely viewed exchange, grilled Florida\u2019s attorney general for defending a state ban on   marriage. Mr. Cooper, who is gay, has seemed to embrace an advocacy role rarely seen among top network anchors, blending    reporting with a distinctly personal and empathetic touch. Until recently, Mr. Cooper did not discuss his sexuality in public. On Tuesday, for what he said was the first time he could remember, he referred to himself as gay on the air. \u201cAs gay people, we share strands of a common bond,\u201d he said during the final moments of his   broadcast. \u201cIf this killer hoped to set us backwards, to make us live in fear, I think he\u2019s made a sickening mistake. \u201d Speaking on Wednesday from his satellite truck in Orlando, Mr. Cooper insisted, emphatically, that he was no activist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to push an agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to be an advocate, railing at the top of my lungs at injustices that\u2019s the role other people have. \u201d But he said he had been preoccupied this week by memories of previous murders at gay nightclubs, including a 1970s firebombing in New Orleans and the shooting of gay patrons at a Greenwich Village bar in 1980. \u201cThere were people who have died, and no one really told their story,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cI think the fact that I am gay, and I am in a position where I can determine the content of a broadcast at night on CNN.   \u2026     \u201d He let the thought trail off. \u201cThere have been generations of reporting on gay people where that has not been the case. \u201d Opinion is the coin of the realm on cable news, where Rachel Maddow, Sean Hannity and their brethren hold court nightly. Mr. Cooper is viewed as a more traditional   newsman, even if he does not shy away from conveying moral dismay in his coverage. He made his reputation during Hurricane Katrina, when his anguished reports from a decimated New Orleans seemed to channel national frustration with the recovery effort. It is hard to ignore, however, Mr. Cooper\u2019s deeply felt connections with the gay community that was targeted in Orlando. In an exchange that spread quickly online, he confronted the Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, with what he said were complaints from gay residents about her office\u2019s legal defense of Florida\u2019s   marriage ban. \u201cDo you really think you\u2019re a champion of the gay community?\u201d Mr. Cooper asked, suggesting repeatedly that there was a \u201csick irony\u201d in Ms. Bondi\u2019s saying she would now work to help relatives of gay victims. Ms. Bondi said on Wednesday that she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Mr. Cooper\u2019s approach. In a radio interview, she said that all the anchor\u2019s aggressive questioning had done was \u201cencourage anger and hate. \u201d She said that CNN had omitted a portion of the exchange in which she discussed her   for victims\u2019 families and that the location of the interview, in front of an Orlando hospital, \u201cwasn\u2019t the time nor the place. \u201d (Mr. Cooper said Wednesday that Ms. Bondi \u201cwas clearly unhappy at the end of the interview,\u201d adding: \u201cShe intimated that I didn\u2019t like her, and I said, \u2018I have no ill will toward you at all, it\u2019s just my job to ask you questions. \u2019\u201d) But Mr. Cooper, who cut short a European vacation to fly to Florida to cover the shooting, said he preferred to keep his focus on the victims, whose experiences, he said, he easily recognized. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many bars and clubs I\u2019ve been to over the years,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, volunteering that his longtime companion, Benjamin Maisani, owned several gay bars in New York. \u201cEvery gay man in America remembers the first time they went to a gay bar and how they felt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m speaking for the gay community,\u201d said Mr. Cooper, who publicly acknowledged his sexual orientation in 2012. \u201cBut it certainly resonates very deeply for me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562119.9723933}
