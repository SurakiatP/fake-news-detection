Oshins, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in estate planning, has never met the wealthy software entrepreneur Dan Kloiber, but he is nonetheless intensely interested in Mr. Kloiber\u2019s contentious divorce. \u201cI have had a Google news alert on that for a couple years,\u201d Mr. Oshins said as he discussed the case from his office in a squat pink complex about a   drive from the Las Vegas Strip. What animates Mr. Oshins is not the juicy marital feud, but the legal arcana governing a trust in Delaware where the Kloiber family parked assets worth hundreds of million of dollars, sheltered from estate taxes. Mr. Oshins, with a gleeful grin spreading across his face, relished the thought of the    Mrs. Kloiber busting through the trust and exposing a potential chink in  the formidable trust protection armor promised by Delaware  \u2014   which just happens to fiercely compete with Nevada for the lucrative business of shielding assets owned by the superrich. Although most    visitors are drawn to the city\u2019s roulette wheels and slot machines, Mr. Oshins and a battalion of tax lawyers, accountants, advisers, trust administrators and bankers cater to an elite clientele that insists on a much more reliable way to build a fortune. With their backing, Nevada has stoked an aggressive rivalry among a smattering of states to babysit the wealth of the nation\u2019s top 1 percent, pressing public officials to pass laws, streamline regulations, lower fees and replace D. M. V.  service with concierge treatment. Yet even as more and more states seek ways to help the richest Americans protect their wealth from creditors, divorcing spouses and children, as well as some federal and state tax collectors, critics worry that the effort to attract the lucrative trust business is turning into a competitive game of giveaway. \u201cThere is no doubt that many, many jurisdictions are committed to being at the bottom,\u201d said Edward McCaffrey, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. \u201cI think the real question now is: \u2018Where is the bottom? \u2019\u201d The federal government leaves it to each state to draw up its own trust laws, and several have tried to go as far as they can without inciting accusations that they are abetting tax evasion or hiding assets, he said. But in pushing the envelope, they can also run into challenges from courts in other states, including the Kloibers\u2019 home of Kentucky, that have different statutes governing trusts. The clear leaders are Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota and Alaska, but other states have also joined the frenzy. New Hampshire, Wyoming, Tennessee and Ohio all hope to dip a spoon in the    pot of cream that had traditionally been preserved in offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands. Over the last decade, for example, New Hampshire has passed nearly a dozen laws affecting trusts that expanded their life span, lowered taxes and made it easier to transfer assets. In 2013, the state created a special trust court subdivision to handle the complex litigation last year, an overhaul of state banking laws simplified regulations. Still, Nevada \u201cis definitely the most aggressive in my experience in terms of asset protection,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said. Starting with the absence of any state income tax and resilient secrecy protections, Nevada has added a passel of laws and regulations intended to lure trust business. Individuals who establish   irrevocable trusts have more flexibility to transfer assets to a new trust with more favorable terms. Creditors are blocked from access to money held in trusts (making the arrangement also popular among doctors, who worry a malpractice case could bankrupt them). And what are known as dynasty trusts allow the wealthy to pass their fortunes from generation to generation for hundreds of years without paying estate taxes. Defenders of the industry won what was characterized as a \u201cdo or die\u201d battle in 2013, fending off legislation that would have opened up Nevada trusts to future claims from spouses and domestic partners for property settlements, alimony or child support. And Nevada has only a narrow   window for creditors to make a claim against a trust\u2019s assets. These sorts of loopholes have been criticized by some legal scholars as \u201cnot morally defensible,\u201d but defenders dismissed the potential for abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s against the law in this state to conceal assets from legitimate creditors,\u201d said Mark A. Hutchison, Nevada\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, a lawyer himself. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be aware of phantom threats that could blow up our industry,\u201d he added. Phantom threats, he said, include recent suspicions  \u2014   after the leak of the Panama Papers  \u2014   that citizens and foreigners are illegally hiding assets in the state. Private documents from the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed that the firm had incorporated more than a thousand shell companies in Nevada and Wyoming to hide the real owners\u2019 identities. There are sometimes legitimate reasons individuals and businesses want to conceal their identities, but the papers suggested that evading taxes was often the purpose. Other documents tied the shell companies to corruption scandals in Brazil, Argentina and officials at FIFA, the soccer\u2019s world governing body. If the revelations were a source of embarrassment, however, they were also a source of free worldwide publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s actually helped us, believe it or not,\u201d said Greg Crawford, president of the Alliance Trust Company in Reno, explaining that Nevada was not as well known internationally for its   policies as Delaware. \u201cI\u2019ve had more calls from people overseas, established families, who are interested in Nevada. \u201d Mr. Crawford disputed the idea that the state\u2019s rules were abetting criminal activities. \u201cThe honest, ethical taxpaying people around the world who simply want privacy are happy to put assets in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cCrooks know they can be confiscated, so it actually serves as a   process. \u201d Monitoring development in other states and bulking up asset protection laws, said Mr. Hutchison, the lieutenant governor, has dependable bipartisan support. \u201cThe trust business is a big business,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always viewed it as a way to stimulate the economy. \u201d Although trusts generate little public revenue or direct investment in the state, they do provide a steady stream of work for those in the industry. Supporters also say they generate indirect investment by drawing wealthy people who spend money and might invest later on. Robert H. Sitkoff, a Harvard Law School professor, said that in   states like Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Alaska, trust and estate lawyers \u201care an effective and important lobby in a way that would be much harder to replicate in a place like New York, a big state with lots going on. \u201d With the competition so intense, each state tries to exploit marginal advantages and highlight rivals\u2019 weaknesses. The marketing pitch is not always about keeping up with the neighbors, however. Even as Nevada and Delaware blocked   with claims for child support, for example, New Hampshire decided not to follow suit. \u201cWe have reviewed that and said that\u2019s not our policy,\u2019\u201d said William F. J. Ardinger, a lawyer at Rath, Young  Pignatelli who has lobbied for changes in New Hampshire\u2019s trust laws. His state is making a different kind of appeal. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of wealth on the Eastern Seaboard, and New Hampshire fares well in the mind of those families,\u201d Mr. Ardinger said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018I went to prep school at Exeter,\u2019 or, \u2018I went to Camp Winaukee as a kid.\u2019 \u201cReno is a beautiful place, but it\u2019s not \u2018On Golden Pond. \u2019\u201d The Las Vegas lawyer Mr. Oshins, who almost makes the Kardashians look shy, is unfazed by such comparisons. \u201cNew Hampshire is a little bit of a wannabe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a   state. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562860.7907524}
