Comparing results on the two continents, using independent data as well as academic and industry research, shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise. \\nAn analysis by The Times using U.N. data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany . Also, a recent National Academy of Sciences report found \u201cthere was little evidence\u201d that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the United States had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops. \\nAt the same time, herbicide use has increased in the United States, even as major crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties. And the United States has fallen behind Europe\u2019s biggest producer, France, in reducing the overall use of pesticides, which includes both herbicides and insecticides.'"}, "time": 1742564360.1906462}
