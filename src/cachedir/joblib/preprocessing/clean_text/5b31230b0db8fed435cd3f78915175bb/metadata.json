But the Inhuman likes of Black Bolt, Crystal and Lockjaw, the teleporting dog, will first appear on big screens. As in the biggest. Imax Corporation, Marvel and the ABC broadcast network announced a partnership on Monday to introduce  \u2014   and finance  \u2014   a lavish new television series that will focus on the Inhuman royal family. Under the agreement, a version that combines the initial two episodes of \u201cMarvel\u2019s The Inhumans,\u201d shot entirely with Imax cameras, will play exclusively for two weeks next September on Imax screens worldwide. Shortly thereafter, the episodes  \u2014   edited to include additional scenes  \u2014   will run on ABC, with new installments unspooling in typical   fashion. (The look of the series on TV will be enhanced due to Imax technology.) The series, billed as a family   with signature Marvel humor, will be set in the present day, with some action seeming to take place on the moon. The deal is significant for several reasons. As their live audiences have dwindled and competition has increased, broadcast networks have struggled to create sizzle around new shows. ABC, which urgently needs new hits, is betting that Imax, with its strength among younger consumers known as fanboys, will help make \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d a   event. \u201cIn the incredibly crowded marketplace of television, we are very excited about this because it\u2019s a unique and innovative and bold way to debut our best new content,\u201d Ben Sherwood, president of   Television Group, said by phone. The deal also indicates that Disney remains focused on telling Marvel stories on ABC after an unexceptional start to that effort. \u201cMarvel\u2019\u2019s Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. \u201d has brought more male viewers to ABC, but it has been only a modest ratings performer. Another effort, \u201cAgent Carter,\u201d was a misfire. ABC wants what Marvel Television and ABC Studios have supplied to Netflix  \u2014     widely watched series like \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and \u201cDaredevil. \u201d A   arrangement with Imax will allow ABC and Marvel to spend more to make \u201cThe Inhumans,\u201d which will include   visual effects. (One criticism of \u201cAgents of S. H. I. E. L. D. \u201d has been that certain action sequences are less than dazzling.) Imax has never before served as a financing participant in a TV series, according to Richard L. Gelfond, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe think this is a business for us,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said of the financing arrangement. \u201cBecause Imax has an equity participation both in the pilot and in the series, this deal will be financially advantageous to Imax on an ongoing basis. \u201d Imax has dabbled in the past at showing TV content on its supersize screens. Last year, for instance, it played a couple of Season 4 episodes of \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d But a series has never before made its debut through Imax, which has more than 1, 000 locations worldwide. \u201cWe see it as a way to extend the Imax brand and diversify our revenue,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said. In particular, he hopes television content could help draw crowds to Imax locations at times of the year  \u2014   like fall  \u2014   when there is a dearth of   movies. Imax worked for years to find a winning strategy for quieter times at the box office most recently it tried showing films aimed at older audiences, which delivered weak results. \u201cWe\u2019re confident our exhibition partners will be excited about this,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said. \u201cThe response from conceptual conversations has been extremely positive. \u201d Marvel, which has been on a   tear, initially expected to turn the Inhumans into a string of movies, even announcing its plans publicly in 2014. But the studio ultimately decided the property would be a better fit for TV, in part because there were already a lot of different Marvel movie franchises continuing. Mr. Sherwood, noting pains have been taken to make sure ABC affiliates are on board with the Imax debut, said the \u201csneak peek\u201d of \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d would include \u201cbig, theatrical moments specially conceived for the Imax screen. \u201d The series debut will also come at a time when no Marvel movies are playing in theaters. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios  \u2014   and this is a critical point  \u2014   to make sure that   and   we are only enhancing the Marvel universe,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564481.19119}
