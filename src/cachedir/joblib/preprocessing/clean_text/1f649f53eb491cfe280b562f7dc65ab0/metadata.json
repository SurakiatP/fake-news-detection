As this is being written on noon Sunday, for instance, Investors Business Daily (IBD), which touts its survey as \u201cthe most accurate poll in recent presidential elections,\" has Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton by one point. The USC Dornsife/ Los Angeles Times \u2019 \u201cDaybreak\u201d poll shows Trump ahead of Clinton by five points. \\nNate Silver, in his FiveThirtyEight 2016 Election Forecast, has Clinton\u2019s chance of winning at 64.7 percent versus Trump\u2019s 35.3 percent. Silver predicts Clinton will win 48.4 percent of the popular vote (versus Trump\u2019s 45.5 percent, which will give her 291 Electoral College votes to Trump\u2019s 246. \\nIn its running summary of other polls, Real Clear Politics shows Clinton up by 1.8 percent over Trump in the popular vote, while in the Electoral College it\u2019s Clinton with 216 and Trump with 164, leaving 158 votes as \u201ctoss ups.\" \\nThere are at least two other prognosticators who don\u2019t rely on polls at all, and they are predicting Trump will win on Tuesday. The first was explained by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge back in January when he said that the stock market would predict November\u2019s winner: This relationship occurs because the stock market reflects the economic outlook in the weeks leading up to the election. A rising stock market indicates an improving economy, which means rising confidence and increases the chances of the incumbent party\u2019s re-election. Therefore, your time might be better spent from August through October watching the stock market rather than the debates if you want to know who will be President for the next four years. \\nRight on cue the stock market has declined nine days in a row (through last Friday), the first time that has happened since 1980. But more importantly is how it has behaved since Monday, August 1. The S&P 500 Index has declined by 4.5 percent which, according to Durden, translates into an 86 percent chance of Trump\u2019s winning on Tuesday. \\nAnd then there\u2019s the professor from Stony Brook University, Helmut Norpoth, and his \u201cPrimary Model\u201d. Writes Norpoth on his website: Winning early primaries is a major key for electoral victory in November. Trump won the Republican primaries in both New Hampshire and South Carolina, while Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders split the Democratic primaries in those states\u2026. For the record the Primary Model \u2026 has correctly predicted the winner of the popular vote in all five presidential elections since it was introduced in 1996\u2026. For elections from 1912 to 2012 the Primary Model [has retroactively picked] the winner \u2026 every time except in 1960. \\nAccordingly, Norpoth gives Trump an 87 percent chance of winning Tuesday\u2019s election. \\nThere\u2019s also his \u201cpendulum\u201d model: What favors the GOP in 2016 as well \u2026 is the cycle of presidential elections. After two terms of Democrat Barack Obama in the White House the electoral pendulum is poised to swing to the GOP this year\u2026. Donald Trump is predicted to defeat Hillary Clinton by 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent. \\nIn the \u201cfor what it\u2019s worth\u201d category, as this is being written, futures for Monday\u2019s open are also turning negative. If the market closes down again on Monday, the 10th day in a row, it will only add validity to both Durden\u2019s and Norpoth\u2019s prediction: Trump will win on Tuesday. \\nAlso, Professor Norpoth has such confidence in his models that he is using his own money to bet on Trump to win. \\n\\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.
