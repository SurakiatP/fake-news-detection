Ambassador Stevens had to be silenced. And Petraeus had to be put in a place where he was not forced to testify before Congress because he could not take the fifth before Congress. From Beforeitsnews: At the same time, Clinton was broadcasting Stevens whereabouts and she refused to provide the extra protection Stevens was so desperately requesting. Being that Stevens was working for the CIA, then head of the CIA, David Petraeus, would have known about Chris Stevens activities. To protect Obama\u2019s 2012 election, both Stevens and Petraeus had to be gone. People are asking me how I knew all of this four years ago and I say, \u201cI had a deep cover source from inside one of the military/intelligence services who wanted the real truth to be told. Somebody who knew this nation could not afford to let Clinton ever become President\u201d. Now, I am getting confirmation from Wikileaks and others who have reached the same conclusion I did four years ago. Dear Mr. Hodges, This is to inform you that Wikileaks will soon, or has released Clinton emails which will demonstrate the following: The above is already appearing on the Internet in several places. It is clear that Putin would be a fool to allow Clinton and her gang of thugs to continue with their plan. Every time Clinton sags in the polls, she starts talking about 9/11. The evidence is beginning to line up that Clinton interests had motive to commit 9/11. No wonder Clinton tries to blame the Russians for everything, she is the main culprit on the world being brought to the precipice of World War III. It is a gratifying feeling when the dots start to connect. The Aaron Klein Revelations: Aaron Klein, the Breitbart Bureau Chief for Jerusalem revealed, in a Breitbart publication dated March 1, 2016, revealed that \u201cthe email from April 10th, 2011, the State Department employee, Timmy Davis, forwarded an email to the server by Clinton\u2019s aide, Huma Abedin.\u201d Please note that the time of this revelation, Huma Abedin, was not yet a household name. The series of emails will eventually have catastrophic consequences for Ambassador Stevens. \u201cAn email containing the whereabouts and plans of murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens passed through Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server, dispatches released Monday in the final group of messages from Clinton\u2019s emails reveal.\u201d \\nBelow are some examples of the allegations posed by Klein and these are not empty charges as Klein offered as proof, the following emails. \\n\u201cA March 27, 2011 email released last year was titled, \u201cChris Stevens mission.\u201d It divulged: \u201cThe current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage offshore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days. \\nAn April 8, 2011 email was forwarded to Clinton revealing the \u201csecurity situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required.\u201d \\nAn April 22, 2011 email revealed Stevens was on the road: \u201cI want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.\u201d \\nAn April 24, 2011 email has the exact time of a Stevens meeting: \u201c\u201dStevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off.\u201d \\nIf later emails are released, I have no doubt, that we will see that Clinton was transmitting Stevens location up until the time of the attack upon the Benghazi compound and this explains why some of these emails are not being released. However, at some point, they will see the light of day. \\nThe release of travel information, in any form, is a felony! Remember, the Stevens travel plans are classified and they came from Clinton\u2019s private server. A casual Law and Order fan could make the causal connections between the release of these emails and Stevens death. This is absolute evidence that Clinton not only is guilty of multiple felonies, she is an accomplice to murder! '"}, "time": 1742561978.220017}
