The deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, came after North Korea launched four ballistic missiles on Monday, apparently in response to joint naval exercises by South Korea and the United States. Those launchings led South Korea to call for the accelerated deployment of Thaad. A spokeswoman for the United States forces in South Korea said that one of five major components of the missile system had arrived on Monday. Officials said it could take a couple of months for the system to become fully operational. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had urged the South Koreans to move ahead with the deployment of the system during a visit to Seoul in February. In telephone calls on Monday to South Korean and Japanese leaders, President Trump said the United States would stand with its Asian allies and take steps to defend against North Korea\u2019s growing ballistic missile threat. Mr. Trump emphasized that the United States was taking steps to \u201cenhance our ability to deter and defend against North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles using the full range of United States military capabilities,\u201d the White House said in a statement. China has been incensed over the deployment of the system, fearing it could give the United States military the ability to quickly detect and track missiles launched in China, according to analysts. A spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, said Tuesday that China would \u201ctake the necessary steps to safeguard our own security interests, and the consequences will be shouldered by the United States and South Korea. \u201d Mr. Geng warned the two countries not to \u201cgo further and further down the wrong road. \u201d Yang Xiyu, a former senior Chinese official who once oversaw talks with North Korea, said China was worried that the deployment of the system would open the door to a broader American network of antimissile systems in the region, possibly in places like Japan and the Philippines, to counter a growing Chinese military. \u201cChina can see benefits only for a U. S. regional plan, not for South Korea\u2019s national security interest,\u201d he said. The state media recently encouraged Chinese citizens to boycott South Korean products and companies over the Thaad issue. The Chinese authorities recently forced the closing of 23 stores owned by Lotte, a South Korean conglomerate that agreed to turn over land that it owned for use in the Thaad deployment. Hundreds of Chinese protested at Lotte stores over the weekend, some holding banners that read, \u201cGet out of China. \u201d Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. the head of the United States Pacific Command, announced the start of the deployment, saying that \u201ccontinued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday\u2019s launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy Thaad to South Korea. \u201d The developments come as South Korea is consumed by turmoil over the impeachment of President Park   whose administration agreed to the Thaad deployment. But with the president facing possible removal from office over a corruption scandal, the fate of the system had been in doubt. Its accelerated deployment could make it harder, if not impossible, for her successor to head off its installation. Moon   an opposition leader who is the   in the race to replace President Park, acknowledged that it would be difficult to overturn South Korea\u2019s agreement to deploy the system. But he has insisted that the next South Korean government should have the final say on the matter, saying that Ms. Park\u2019s government never allowed a full debate on it. Last year, thousands of people in Seongju, a rural southern county in South Korea, protested when it was announced that a Thaad battery would be established there. They said they feared that the system would harm their agricultural livelihoods. Many South Koreans also worry that any expansion of military ties with the United States could worsen already festering tensions with North Korea and China. Under its deal with Washington, South Korea is providing the land for the missile system and will build the base, but the United States will pay for the system, to be built by Lockheed Martin, as well as its operational costs. The United States military statement said that \u201cthe first elements\u201d of Thaad were deployed on Monday, the same day as the North\u2019s missile launchings. A   cargo plane landed at the United States military\u2019s Osan Air Base, about 40 miles south of Seoul, on Monday evening, carrying two trucks, each mounted with a Thaad launchpad. More equipment and personnel will start arriving in the coming weeks, South Korean military officials said. \u201cSouth Korea and the United States are doing their best to make the Thaad system operational as soon as possible,\u201d the South Korean Defense Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the system was necessary \u201cto protect South Korea from the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea. \u201d The ministry declined to specify when the system would be operational. But the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the deployment was likely to be completed in one or two months, with the system ready for use by April. The arrival of Thaad equipment was announced after South Korea\u2019s acting president, Hwang   talked with Mr. Trump on the phone on Tuesday morning. The two leaders condemned the North\u2019s missile tests as a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreed to beef up the allies\u2019 joint defense posture, strengthen sanctions and step up pressure against the North, Mr. Hwang\u2019s office said. On the phone with Mr. Trump, Mr. Hwang called the North\u2019s nuclear and missile threat a \u201cpresent and direct danger\u201d to its allies, his office said. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he spoke for 25 minutes on Tuesday with Mr. Trump, who reiterated his pledge to stand by Japan \u201c100 percent,\u201d according to the public broadcaster NHK. \u201cI appreciate that the United States is showing that all the options are on the table,\u201d Mr. Abe said, adding that Japan was \u201cready to fulfill larger roles and responsibilities\u201d to deter North Korea. Takashi Kawakami, a professor of international politics and security at Takushoku University in Tokyo, said the deployment of Thaad could put the United States in a stronger position to consider a   strike on North Korea. If the United States took such action, he said, \u201cNorth Korea is going to make a counterattack on the U. S. or Japan or another place, so in this case they will use Thaad. \u201d With tensions increasing over the deployment of the system, some in China have advocated stern measures, including severing diplomatic relations with South Korea, or more. A retired general, Luo Yuan, even suggested that China destroy the system with a military strike. \u201cWe could conduct a surgical   operation that would destroy the target, paralyzing it and making it unable to hit back,\u201d General Luo wrote in Global Times, a   newspaper.'"}, "time": 1742562339.9208386}
