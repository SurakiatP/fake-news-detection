[At the end of the farcical display, and with neither Israel nor the Palestinian Authority in attendance, the Paris summit representatives released a brief concluding declaration unanimously agreed to after negotiations between the countries.  Reports here credited Israeli diplomats with helping to water down the   language of the final declaration, calling the text a \u201csignificant weakening\u201d and \u201cless harsh than was initially expected. \u201d Still, the text was anything but fair. Here are five   offenses in the   final declaration: 1  \u2014   The text draws a moral equivalency between \u201cviolence,\u201d which would include Palestinian terrorism targeting civilians, and \u201csettlement activity,\u201d meaning Israelis building homes in the West Bank or eastern sections of Jerusalem. The text states: They emphasized the importance for the parties to restate their commitment to this solution, to take urgent steps in order to reverse the current negative trends on the ground, including continued acts of violence and ongoing settlement activity, and to start meaningful direct negotiations. 2  \u2014   The declaration calls for Israel to \u201cfully end the occupation that began in 1967,\u201d language that seems to mean that Israel would need to withdraw from the entire West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and thus shrink the country to indefensible borders. Those are the territories that Israel captured in the defensive war of 1967.  Withdrawing \u201cfully\u201d would seem to imply that Israel should evacuate those territories in their entirety. Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem and Joseph\u2019s Tomb in Nablus  \u2014   biblical Shechem. The diplomats who convened in Paris, however, seem unaware of the text of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which today\u2019s declaration affirms as the basis of a future   deal. After stating that Israel should \u201cfully end the occupation that began in 1967,\u201d the Paris declaration then references Resolution 242. The declaration states: They reiterated that a negotiated   solution should meet the legitimate aspirations of both sides, including the Palestinians\u2019 right to statehood and sovereignty, fully end the occupation that began in 1967, satisfy Israel\u2019s security needs and resolve all permanent status issues on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and also recalled relevant Security Council resolutions. Resolution 242 calls on Israel to withdraw under a future   solution \u201cfrom territories occupied\u201d as a result of the 1967 Six Day War. The resolution does not call for a withdrawal from \u201call territories,\u201d a designation deliberately left out to ensure Israel\u2019s ability to retain some territory for security purposes under a future deal. The Jewish Virtual Library explains: The Security Council did not say Israel must withdraw from \u201call the\u201d territories occupied after the   War. This was quite deliberate. The Soviet delegate wanted the inclusion of those words and said that their exclusion meant \u201cthat part of these territories can remain in Israeli hands. \u201d The Arab states pushed for the word \u201call\u201d to be included, but this was rejected. They nevertheless asserted that they would read the resolution as if it included the word \u201call. \u201d The British ambassador who drafted the approved resolution, Lord Caradon, declared after the vote: \u201cIt is only the resolution that will bind us, and we regard its wording as clear. \u201d 3  \u2014    The declaration patronizes Israel by calling on both parties to \u201crestate\u201d their commitments to the   solution. Only one side has not been committed to peace. Israel has offered the Palestinians a state in much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with a shared capital in Jerusalem numerous times. These offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, and more offers were made in 2008. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli offers of statehood and bolted negotiations without counteroffers. The PA has failed to respond to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s unprecedented attempts to   negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state, including freezing Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and releasing Palestinian prisoners. 4  \u2014   The declaration gives credibility to the   Arab Peace Initiative, which threatens Israel\u2019s security. The declaration states: \u201cThey underscored the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 as a comprehensive framework for the resolution of the   conflict, thus contributing to regional peace and security,\u201d states today\u2019s declaration. This reporter previously exposed the Saudi \u201cpeace\u201d initiative: The Saudi Initiative, originally proposed by Saudi Arabia in 2002, states that Israel would receive \u201cnormal relations\u201d with the Arab world in exchange for a full withdrawal from the entire Gaza Strip, West Bank, Golan Heights and eastern Jerusalem, which includes the Temple Mount.   \u2026     The Saudi plan also demands the imposition of a   U. N. resolution that calls for   Palestinian refugees who wish to move inside Israel to be permitted to do so at the \u201cearliest practicable date. \u201d Palestinians have long demanded the \u201cright of return\u201d for millions of \u201crefugees,\u201d a formula Israeli officials across the political spectrum warn is code for Israel\u2019s destruction by flooding the Jewish state with millions of Arabs, thereby changing its demographics. When Arab countries attacked the Jewish state after its creation in 1948, some 725, 000 Arabs living within Israel\u2019s borders fled or were expelled from the area that became Israel. Also at that time, about 820, 000 Jews were expelled from Arab countries or fled following rampant persecution. While most Jewish refugees were absorbed by Israel and other countries, the majority of Palestinian Arabs have been maintained in 59 U. N.  camps that do not seek to settle its inhabitants elsewhere. There are currently about four million Arabs who claim Palestinian refugee status with the U. N. including children and grandchildren of the original fleeing Arabs Arabs living   in Jordan and Arabs who long ago emigrated throughout the Middle East and to the West. According to Arab sources close to the Saudi Initiative, Arab countries are willing to come to an agreement whereby Israel absorbs about 500, 000 \u201crefugees\u201d and reaches a compensation deal with the PA for the remaining millions of Palestinians. 5  \u2014   The Paris declaration \u201cwelcomed\u201d UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which passed last month when the U. S. abstained and refers to the entire West Bank and eastern Jerusalem as   occupied Palestinian territories while demanding a complete halt to all Israeli construction in those areas.
