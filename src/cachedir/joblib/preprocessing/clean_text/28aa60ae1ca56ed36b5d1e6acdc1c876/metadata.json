And this time, Brady has virtually no chance of escaping a   suspension. Goodell\u2019s victory came in a ruling by a   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that overturned a   decision and affirmed that Goodell, the N. F. L. commissioner, had broad discretion to suspend players according to the collective bargaining agreement with the players\u2019 union. The panel\u2019s decision can be appealed to the full Second Circuit, or even the Supreme Court, but the chance of a victory for Brady is \u201cclose to nil,\u201d said Michael LeRoy, who teaches labor law at the University of Illinois at  . Assuming nothing changes, Brady could return to regular play as soon as Oct. 9. The N. F. L. \u2019s decision in the   Deflategate case  \u2014   suspending one of its most popular players for being \u201cgenerally aware\u201d of a plot to deflate footballs in the 2015 A. F. C. championship game  \u2014   captivated the nation like few football stories. Over the years, sports leagues have fought with some of their best players, including cases in which Major League Baseball butted heads with Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez. But never has a showdown between a league and a player centered on whether the player wanted to manipulate the air pressure in a ball. The case drew expert analysis from physicists and excoriation from fans  \u2014   many in New England  \u2014   who believed that the commissioner\u2019s ruling was based on inadequate evidence. The saga raised fundamental questions about fairness on the field how teams look for an edge and whether the commissioner, who views himself as a stern taskmaster, had overstepped his bounds. The league\u2019s decision to go after Brady also pitted the commissioner against Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the Patriots and long one of Goodell\u2019s staunchest allies. At the Super Bowl in Arizona shortly after the scandal broke, Kraft, in a highly unusual move for an owner, lambasted the league for its handling of the case during an impromptu news conference. He also objected to the $1 million fine and loss of draft picks imposed on his team, but eventually accepted the penalties. Brady\u2019s lawyers had argued that he was unfairly suspended after he was accused of involvement in a scheme to deflate footballs used in a playoff game, and last summer, a Federal District Court judge agreed, allowing Brady to play the entire 2015 season. The N. F. L. appealed that ruling to the Second Circuit, which heard oral arguments in early March. The judges were openly skeptical of many of the arguments made by Brady\u2019s lawyer, signaling that they sided with the N. F. L. \u2019s case that Goodell had broad discretion to suspend players. In their decision, the judges did not consider the underlying facts of the case, including the science of football deflation, but instead looked solely at whether Goodell, as arbitrator, acted in the spirit of the collective bargaining agreement. \u201cWe hold that the commissioner properly exercised this broad discretion under the collective bargaining agreement and that his procedural rulings were properly grounded in that agreement and did not deprive Brady of fundamental fairness,\u201d Judges Barrington Daniels Parker Jr. and Denny Chin wrote in their opinion. \u201cAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to confirm the award. \u201d In a dissent, Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann said that Goodell had overstepped his role as arbitrator by changing his reason for penalizing Brady after he had heard the quarterback\u2019s appeal. Initially, Goodell suspended Brady for his role in the plot to deflate footballs, then argued that Brady had obstructed the league\u2019s investigation of the incident by destroying his cellphone, which might have contained messages between Brady and members of the Patriots\u2019 staff. The Second Circuit made \u201cthe right ruling that conforms to a very well established pattern in the labor law,\u201d LeRoy said. The judges said that despite the protestations of Kraft, Brady and the N. F. L. Players Association, Goodell was merely acting on the powers to which the league and union had agreed in their labor deal, the latest of which was signed in 2011. The judges acknowledged that the   pact in which the person who penalizes players also listens to appeals of those penalties might be unconventional, but they would not get in the way of a longstanding and transparent contract. \u201cIn their collective bargaining agreement, the players and the league mutually decided many years ago that the commissioner should investigate possible rule violations, should impose appropriate sanctions, and may preside at arbitrations challenging his discipline,\u201d the judges wrote. The N. F. L. hailed the decision. \u201cWe are pleased the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled today that the commissioner properly exercised his authority under the collective bargaining agreement to act in cases involving the integrity of the game,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThat authority has been recognized by many courts and has been expressly incorporated into every collective bargaining agreement between the N. F. L. and N. F. L. P. A. for the past 40 years. \u201d The players association said it was disappointed. \u201cWe fought Roger Goodell\u2019s suspension of Tom Brady because we know he did not serve as a fair arbitrator and that players\u2019 rights were violated under our collective bargaining agreement,\u201d it said in a statement. If Brady\u2019s suspension is not overturned by a higher court, he will presumably sit out the first four games of the season. (He is allowed to play and practice with the team in the preseason.) The Patriots play their opening game in Glendale, Ariz. against the Cardinals, and their next three games at home, in Foxborough, Mass. against the Miami Dolphins, the Houston Texans and the Buffalo Bills. Brady would then be eligible to return in Week 5, when the Patriots travel to Cleveland to play the Browns. The drama began on Jan. 18, 2015, when the New England Patriots hammered the Indianapolis Colts,   to advance to the Super Bowl. Shortly after the game, the N. F. L. began investigating whether the Patriots had used deflated footballs to gain an unfair advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Brady said at the time, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s the last of my worries. \u201d The N. F. L. released the results of its investigation last May, which stated that two   Patriots employees had knowingly deflated balls below the legal limit and that it was \u201cmore probable than not that Brady was at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities. \u201d A few days after the release of the report, the N. F. L. suspended Brady for four games without pay. By some measures, the case has done nothing to dent Brady\u2019s popularity, or the country\u2019s fascination with one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars. On Monday, the players\u2019 association said that licensed merchandise with Brady\u2019s name on it was the   among all players last season, topping Peyton Manning, Russell Wilson and other popular players. Given the Patriots\u2019 success the past 15 years, some fans are scrambling to adjust to the possibility that Brady will sit out the first four weeks of the season. BookMaker Sportsbook is reassessing its predictions for the Patriots\u2019 season opener against the Cardinals. \u201cJimmy Garoppolo is certainly serviceable, but he\u2019s not Tom Brady,\u201d the company wrote about Brady\u2019s backup. \u201cAnd putting him under center on \u2018Sunday Night Football\u2019 in Week 1 for his first career N. F. L. start is asking quite a bit, especially against an elite Arizona secondary. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562111.421834}
