Mike Pence of Indiana as he accepted the vice presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, its third night, and made the case for Donald J. Trump as a Christian and a conservative.  Keeping in the line of \u201cMaking America\u201d something, the night\u2019s theme was \u201cMaking America First Again,\u201d and featured speeches by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s sons and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, one of his former rivals. The highlights: \u2022 If you were waiting for the usual kind of convention speech, you just saw it. Mr. Pence, the nominee for vice president, delivered what may have been the only speech that closely resembled the typical presentation at a nominating convention. He thanked his family, introduced his wife, lauded his   ticked off policy ideas, made a few jokes and expressed optimism about the country and his party\u2019s chances to win in November. \u201cIt\u2019s change versus the status quo, and when Donald Trump is president, the change will be huge,\u201d Mr. Pence said. He criticized Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party, describing them as \u201centrenched in power. \u201d He closed out Day 3 of the convention by declaring, \u201cWe have but one choice\u201d  \u2014   to elect Donald Trump the 45th president. _____ \u2022 After an extended and often soaring speech focusing on notes of freedom and American conservative ideals, Mr. Cruz refused to specifically call for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, despite repeated shouts from the crowd to endorse him, including \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d He chided the crowd and said, \u201cDon\u2019t stay home in November,\u201d but he also told them to \u201cvote their conscience. \u201d As Mr. Cruz wrapped up his extended remarks, Mr. Trump emerged from a side entrance, waving to the crowd. He joined his family in the V. I. P. box, as both the crowd and every television camera cut from Mr. Cruz just as he was delivering the crescendo to his remarks. He closed saying, \u201cGod bless America\u201d on a split screen, as the cameras had shifted to Mr. Trump, who in a rare spontaneous moment at the often orchestrated conventions, stole the show from Mr. Cruz once more. _____ \u2022 Mr. Gingrich took the stage after a brief introduction by his wife, Callista, and attempted to clean up the   by Mr. Cruz that sent the night into momentary chaos. Citing Mr. Cruz\u2019s line that \u201cyou can vote your conscience,\u201d Mr. Gingrich offered \u201cto paraphrase Ted Cruz: if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible choice is the   Republican ticket. \u201d He then transitioned to a long list of national security failures, portraying Mr. Trump as the only candidate who can handle the foreign policy threats facing the country, before returning to a closing call for unity. _____ \u2022 Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a   Trump rival, declared that Americans should choose Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton, repeating that \u201cAmerica deserves better!\u201d Mr. Walker said he had always been clear that he would support any Republican against Mrs. Clinton in the general election. Fact Check: He was never an enthusiastic Trump fan. Mr. Walker endorsed Mr. Cruz ahead of the Wisconsin primary, and later expressed disappointment that Mr. Trump would be the party\u2019s  . \u201cIt\u2019s just sad in America that we have such poor choices right now,\u201d Mr. Walker said then. _____ \u2022 Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another former Trump rival, once called Mr. Trump a \u201ccon man,\u201d and worse, as he fought a bitter campaign. But on Wednesday, Mr. Rubio appeared in a brief video to concede that \u201cthe time for fighting each other is over. \u201d The video was hardly full of enthusiasm, but he did urge voters to choose Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton. _____ \u2022 Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s sons, offered a passionate, energetic speech on behalf of his father, describing him as the candidate who is running to make the lives of ordinary Americans better. The elder Trump sat in the audience for his son\u2019s remarks, clapping occasionally but appearing to express displeasure as the large screen behind Eric Trump appeared to malfunction. Eric Trump said his father ran for president because he could \u201cno longer bear witness\u201d to America\u2019s decline. He urged people to vote for his father, a man who \u201ccan\u2019t be bought, sold, purchased, bribed, coerced or intimidated. \u201d _____ \u2022 Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio   host, energized the crowd with verbal attacks on two targets: Mrs. Clinton and the media. Ms. Ingraham called her the \u201cwoman who helped orchestrate America\u2019s decline,\u201d and she drew chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d when she said that \u201cmany in public office don\u2019t enforce or respect the rule of law  \u2014   isn\u2019t that right, Mrs. Clinton?\u201d She called the media her \u201cfriends,\u201d but she accused journalists of not reporting on \u201cthe phonies, the frauds and the corruption that has gone unexposed and uncovered for too long. \u201d _____ \u2022 Pam Bondi, the attorney general of Florida, emphasized \u201claws\u201d in her remarks, using that theme to call attention to the fatal shooting of three police officers in Baton Rouge, La. on Sunday. She drove home her riff by saying, \u201cnow more than ever, laws that back our law enforcement. They have our backs, and Donald Trump will have your backs. \u201d _____ \u2022 Eileen Collins, the first woman to lead a space shuttle mission, may be the only speaker at the convention to appear onstage without once mentioning the Republican Party, Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama or any other politicians. Instead, on the 47th anniversary of Neil Armstrong\u2019s walk on the moon, Ms. Collins offered a gauzy appeal for America to be a \u201cnation of explorers. \u201d One thing she never said: Support Mr. Trump for president. _____ \u2022 Mr. Trump is extremely unpopular with the Hispanic population, as numerous polls have shown, but he is not without support in the community. Ralph Alvarado, a state senator from Kentucky, took the stage to proclaim, in English and in Spanish, why Hispanics should back Mr. Trump against Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHispanics believe what Republicans believe,\u201d he declared, listing off \u201creligious liberty,\u201d support of the Second Amendment and free speech as key examples. In Spanish, he addressed his \u201chermanos Hispanos,\u201d or Hispanic brothers, saying that their families had fled countries that were plagued by corruption, and urging them to not let that corruption plague the United States.'"}, "time": 1742563655.966918}
