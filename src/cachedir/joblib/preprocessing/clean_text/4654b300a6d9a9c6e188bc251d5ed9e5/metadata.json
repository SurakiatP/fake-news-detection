A sign of accomplishment. The Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations just senselessly erased this tradition. One only has to visit Navy social media pages to see the disgust and outrage of current and former personnel.\u201d \\n\u201cOne by one current leadership continues to erode the very things that set the Navy apart from the other services,\u201d the petition continues. \u201cMr. President, I and the others signing this petition request you use your authority to restore to our Sailors what they have earned.\u201d \\nBut reversing what the military deems progress is an uphill challenge. \\nNavy officials try to justify the change by saying it will grant sailors better career opportunities, but hardly anyone is convinced. \\nIn late September, the Navy eliminated its historic job title system in a move officials admitted was linked to concerns about gender neutrality. The only title to escape unscathed is \u201cseaman\u201d for E-3s and under. \\nThe job title change effort was developed by then-Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Mike Stevens, who retired just before the Navy actually made the official announcement of the major switch. \\nArticle posted with permission from The Daily Caller News Foundation Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .
