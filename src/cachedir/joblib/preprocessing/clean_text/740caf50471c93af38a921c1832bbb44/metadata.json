The Clinton campaign has not yet commented. \\nAs the news broke, Ms Clinton was flying to Iowa to speak alongside women\\'s rights leaders at two rallies. \\nAt a rally in New Hampshire, Donald Trump told the crowds: \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let take her criminal scheme into the oval office. \\n\"I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to write the horrible mistake that they made.\" \\nHe has previously said Ms Clinton should be behind bars and accused her of \"deleting thousands of emails\" to hide them from the FBI, which Ms Clinton denied. \\nThe news was also jumped on by Republicans including house speaker Paul Ryan, who said Ms Clinton had \"nobody but herself to blame but herself\". \\n\"She was entrusted with our nation\\'s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information,\" he said in a statement, renewing his call to exclude Ms Clinton from any classified briefings until the matter was \"fully resolved\". \\nAlong with the investigation over her emails sent and received as secretary of state, the US government recently accused Russia of hacking emails from the Democratic National Convention, which exposed Ms Clinton\\'s team\\'s planned smear of former opponent Bernie Sanders.
