On Monday, Javier Mu\u00f1oz replaces   Miranda, and steps into the title role of the biggest Broadway show in years, playing the nation\u2019s first Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton. He is not exactly new to the role. Over much of the last year, Mr. Mu\u00f1oz has relieved the star once a week, and on other days watched the production from a stool just offstage, waiting in case Mr. Miranda ever took a tumble. (He did not.) Already, he has a reputation and a fan base. He\u2019s been described as the sexy Hamilton because of the swagger he brings to the role, and Mr. Miranda bestowed on him a   Javilton, that has stuck. Mr. Mu\u00f1oz has some obvious similarities to the man he is replacing  \u2014   both have parents from Puerto Rico, graduated from New York City public schools and encountered Broadway as children, becoming passionate about theater. And their careers have been entwined for years  \u2014   Mr. Mu\u00f1oz was Mr. Miranda\u2019s alternate, and then his successor, on \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d and has been his alternate throughout the development of \u201cHamilton. \u201d But Mr. Mu\u00f1oz brings his own life experience to the role. The son of a doorman, he grew up in a housing project  \u2014   the Linden Houses, in East New York, Brooklyn, which he recalls as scarily violent and dangerous. \u201cI can\u2019t lie  \u2014   I\u2019m still afraid of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was so much fear growing up there. \u201d He is 40, openly gay, H. I. V. positive and a cancer survivor  \u2014   he had surgery and radiation last fall, missing weeks of performances in \u201cHamilton,\u201d but has been back in the cast for months. He said he feels strong  \u2014   the virus is undetectable, the cancer screenings negative  \u2014   and is raring to go. \u201cI had my first   in March, and all green lights,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m good. \u201d Last week, as he prepared to take over the role   he sat down to talk about his life and \u201cHamilton\u201d at Candle 79, a vegan restaurant on the Upper East Side where he has repeatedly worked as a host between acting jobs. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. What\u2019s it like to step into the lead role of the biggest musical in memory? I was on Facebook the other day, and Lin released that little teaser of his song with Jennifer Lopez, and I sort of sat there and went, \u201cI\u2019m taking over for this guy?\u201d That just feels incredible. [But] it comes down to the work, right? I\u2019ve been jumping in there every week, and I\u2019ve helped build this character. So it\u2019s like, I\u2019m just enjoying this, man. This is just fun, and glorious. Did you ever feel as if people wished they were seeing the other guy? I felt that way with \u201cHeights. \u201d It would take a lot to earn the audience  \u2014   to be like: \u201cReally, I\u2019m good. I don\u2019t suck. Just come with me. It\u2019s going to be O. K. \u201d But with \u201cHamilton,\u201d we were at the Public, and we mapped out three shows that I was going to go on, and the days varied. It was a test, and it started with such a positive impact because of the history I have with Lin. Going on when President Obama was in the audience must have helped. That\u2019s the turning point. And it helped me feel more confident, too. To know I had their trust. I knew, but that gesture was so generous and really made me feel O. K. Why are you an actor? I decided in high school  \u2014   at Edward R. Murrow in Brooklyn. I just fell in love with the idea that theater can be a mirror, theater can be a commentary, theater can be powerful and can start a conversation that needs to happen. I started working for a children\u2019s literacy organization that used theater to teach literacy in   programs, and that was another powerful thing  \u2014   suddenly the kid who really had trouble reading in class, or was embarrassed to speak out loud because of their accent, was inhabiting a character, using their imagination, reading and writing. That blew my mind. Did you go to Broadway when you were growing up? I did  \u2014   school trips. The first thing I saw was \u201cMe and My Girl. \u201d And I loved it so much  \u2014   I was singing \u201cThe Lambeth Walk\u201d for weeks. After that, any time there was a school trip to Lincoln Center, or anything that was arts related, I was so into it. What happened with your health last fall? How did you know you had cancer? I have been living with H. I. V. since 2002, and I\u2019m undetectable. I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m strong and I\u2019m very out about that because of the stigma still attached to it. But I\u2019ve had a healthy fear about my health since I tested positive, and I asked how to test myself for lumps, because both my parents had cancer. And very early on in my learning how to do a   I found the lump. I wasn\u2019t immediately worried because of where it was  \u2014   and I do want to keep that private because that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s mine in this. But I brought it up to my doc, and that\u2019s what led to further testing and discovery. You didn\u2019t want to tell anyone at \u201cHamilton\u201d?  I was filling myself with disappointment, as if you can blame yourself for cancer. But that\u2019s a thing, you know. I had to reveal it, and then I had to own that I needed help, and I had to ask for help, and that was the hardest thing in the world. You express a lot of gratitude on social media. I have this joke  \u2014   if it\u2019s funny or not funny, I don\u2019t know  \u2014   but the joke is that I have died several times already, and that\u2019s how it feels. My life completely and drastically changed in 2002 when I was diagnosed with H. I. V. and then again last year with cancer. And you can\u2019t unknow what you know. Life is not the same after that. But I\u2019m alive, and I\u2019m for all intents and purposes healthy and well. And I\u2019m grateful for that. You planted a garden on the roof of Richard Rodgers, the theater where \u201cHamilton\u201d is performed. There\u2019s so much energy on the stage, there are so many things we\u2019re doing day in and day out, and I needed something there that felt still and calm, and gardening gives me that stillness and that calmness. Also, I\u2019m growing something. And it may sound cheesy or corny, but it\u2019s really not. The fact that life is created in that little garden bed heals me. It just does. How many shows a week will you do? Seven. It\u2019s the same structure. [For the eighth performance] someone else gets to be sexy  \u2014   I\u2019m going to go eat pizza.'"}, "time": 1742563633.4046597}
