Stop and search has always been a controversial method used by police officers in England and Wales and has always disproportionately targeted black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in Britain. \\nAccording to official figures released in 2013, 27 percent of stop and searches were not based on reasonable grounds for suspicion and concerns, as well as disproportionately targeting young people from BME backgrounds. \\nIn 2014, then-Home Secretary Theresa May, decided to crack down on stop and search, penalizing police forces who used it and imposed restrictions on officers in 2014. \\nA year later in 2015, the head of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police blamed an increase in knife crime on the home secretary\u2019s stop and search reforms. In the same year, the number of fatal stabbings increased by 18 percent in London. \\nLondon knife crime is now at a four year high, according to a report published by the Police and Crime Committee which suggests violent crime, including knives, guns, sexual assaults and robbery have all risen year on year, with knives increasingly becoming a weapon of choice amongst young people . 2 Officers assaulted whilst detaining person with a knife. Glad to hear they are ok!

But there are clear signs that some communities are being disproportionately targeted.\u201d \\nAmber Rudd, the same home secretary who suggested companies draw up a list of their foreign workers, said that, \u201cno one should be stopped on the basis of their race or ethnicity.\u201d \\nFour years later and another report into police use of stop and search, young black men are still being disproportionately targeted by officers, suggesting more needs to be done to tackle racism issues in the Met.

The high profile racially motivated murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence , and the subsequent conviction of his killers 20 years later in 2012, forced the Met to investigate claims of institutional racism.\""}, "time": 1742562279.6062186}
