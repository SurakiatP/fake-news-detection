At last check, there are over 300 million people in the United States, and we can't find anyone better than HRC and 'The Donald'? \\nSadly, we are watching the American presidential election devolve into a competition between the DNC and the GOP as to who can put forward the most corrupt, asinine, power hungry candidate possible. Although the race to the bottom is a voting conundrum for both sides, the extreme left has posited a unique argument that can help social conservatives when it comes to personal principles and the voting booth. \\nIn a world where biological sex is gleefully separated from gender identification, shouldn\u2019t it be acceptable that one might separate selecting a candidate from voting for him or her? Put another way: if having male genitalia doesn't necessarily make you male, then selecting someone for president doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you voted for that person. Right? \\nThis type of disconnected reality is only fair if everyone can play the game. Wow - this is an existential moment! I feel better already. To quote The Kinks : \u201cGirls will be boys, and boys will be girls. It\u2019s a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world\u2026\u201d \\nThank you, transgender community, for helping me work through this \u201cmixed up, muddled up\u201d election. Although I will select Donald Trump for President of the United States, I will not be voting for him. \\nThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m voting for three reasons and three reasons only: \\nI\u2019m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. \\nI\u2019m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. \\nI\u2019m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. \\nThere you have it: three solid reasons for selecting Donald Trump without voting for him. It\u2019s time to be pragmatic. It\u2019s time to select a candidate who will create the greatest amount of disturbance within the system albeit with the least amount of power. \\nWho might that be? Let\u2019s see: \u201c eeny, meeny, miny, moe , H-R-C has got to go! \u201d Really, people - how long are we going to elect the same old political hacks who have consolidated their power for decades? \\nIt is amazing that in a \u201cfree\u201d country we\u2019ve allowed the Clintons to run the DNC (and thus a fair portion of Washington, D.C.) for nearly 30 years! They have manipulated the system for their personal gain to the tune of $110 million! They are willing to sell our country to the nation or company that will pay the highest speaking fee . They lie, cheat, and steal their way to the top. \\nIs this not problematic? Power - and the lack of - is the most important thing for the next president, yet the media isn\u2019t discussing it. \\nHere\u2019s the most substantial difference between Donald Trump and HRC. If elected, Donald Trump would have a fraction of the power of HRC. For crying out loud: 2/3 of the GOP is already against him . Do you hear any major resistance rising up against HRC by DNC insiders? No. Progressives should wake up to the fact that if they vote for HRC, then they prove that their Occupy Wall Street, stick-it-to-the-man gig is a complete sham. \\nIndeed, if progressives vote for HRC, then they\u2019re either quintessential hypocrites who couldn\u2019t care less about the American people or they\u2019re complete idiots being played like a drum by the powers that be in the DNC. \\nMake no mistake about it. I\u2019ll select Trump\u2019s name for president, but I\u2019m not voting for him. Rather, I\u2019m voting to limit the power of the presidency; I\u2019m voting to stop HRC\u2019s quest to become the first Queen of America by wielding the power of her husband\u2019s former kingship. \\nWake up, America! We fought a revolution to prevent such a consolidation of power. I would like to think Americans are smart enough to stop the Clintons from gaining even more of it. \\nProverbs 15:27 - \u201cHe who is greedy for gain troubles his own house.\u201d \""}, "time": 1742562204.4100323}
