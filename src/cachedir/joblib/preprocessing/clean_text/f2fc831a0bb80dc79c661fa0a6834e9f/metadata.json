Thomas is one of the nation\u2019s most influential lawmakers and has admirers from all legal corners. \\nYet, he is ridiculed, belittled, and assaulted with the type of disgusting comments usually reserved for common criminals and deviants. \\nWriting in The New York Times , Maureen Dowd referred to the Justice as \u201cthe creepy guy who acted pervy toward [Anita Hill] and won. \\nThis barrage of insults is not just among his legal and intellectual peers, either. Thomas has been completely wiped clean from any mention in the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. \\nHis accuser Anita Hill, however, is given prominent display. The exhibit features testimonies trumpeting her courage and the surge of women\u2019s activism that ensued, while making only peripheral reference to Thomas. \\nDespite these slights, Thomas continues to speak out. At a speech at the Heritage Foundation, the justice warned that we are \u201cdestroying our institutions.\u201d \\n\u201cAt some point, we are going to have to recognize that we are destroying our institutions,\u201d he said, acknowledging that the Court might also partially be at fault. \u201cWhat have we done to gain their confidence?\u201d he asked. \u201cPerhaps we should ask ourselves what we have done to not earn it or to earn it.\u201d \\nThe court\u2019s lone African-American justice also defended his view that even prior Supreme Court precedents must be bent or broken to comply with the Constitution \u2014 something most of his colleagues don\u2019t believe. \\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got lots of precedents out there that have been changed,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI believe we are obligated to rethink things constantly.\u201d \\nThomas ended with some positive words about former Justice Antonin Scalia, who he affectionately referred to as \u201cNino.\u201d \\nThe court has become evenly divided between liberals and conservatives, a change that could become even more pronounced if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency and controls who will replace Scalia. But Thomas chose to dwell more on his friendship with \u201cNino\u201d than ponder the future without him. \\n\u201cHe was from the north, and I was from the south, but we wound up at the same place,\u201d he said, referring to their views on the paramount importance of the Constitution and individual freedoms. Scalia, he said, fretted over big principles as well as smaller things such as punctuation and syntax.'"}, "time": 1742563534.1078131}
