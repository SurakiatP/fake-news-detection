[The group, the Associated Students of Madison, demanded that the school offer free tuition, free living expenses, and cancel all fees for all African American students as a form of \u201creparations\u201d for the practice of slavery that ended 150 years ago, Fox News reported.  \u201cThe university\u2019s rhetoric suggests that it is committed to diversity and inclusion, so this legislation compels the university to move towards action  \u2014   which is imperative,\u201d said the resolution\u2019s author, ASM Student Council Rep. Tyriek Mack. \u201cIf no one challenges the university\u2019s empty promises, then the racial composition will remain stagnant. \u201d Calling it the \u201cCognitive Dissonance Resolution,\u201d the ASM policy proposal demands free tuition for all black people, including formerly incarcerated criminals. Free tuition, free housing, and no fees would save a black student up to $20, 000 a year. The resolution also demands that universities spend ten percent of their donations on financial aid. Another provision called on the school to weigh admittance by geographical regions, instead of grades. While black students make up only two percent of the student body, University spokeswoman Meredith McGlone insisted that the proportion of students of color has grown from 11 to 15 percent under current administration policies, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. On the other hand, the State of Wisconsin itself is only six percent black, while the U. S. population is 12 percent black. In the end, McGlone said that some of the things the student group wants are not even legal. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear that the methods that they\u2019re suggesting are either legal or the best approach to accomplishing those goals,\u201d McGlone said.
