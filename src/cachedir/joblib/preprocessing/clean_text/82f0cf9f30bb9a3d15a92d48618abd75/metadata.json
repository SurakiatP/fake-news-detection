BREAKING: Rigging the Election \u2013 Video III: Creamer Confirms @HillaryClinton Involvement https://t.co/ozb1frZ7rR #Veritas @PVeritas_Action \\n\u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 24, 2016 \\nThis third installment includes a shocking number of insights into how the Democratic Party has been running the Clinton campaign. Several of the most memorable quotes from the video include: \\n\u201cNobody is really supposed to know about me.\u201d-Aaron Black \\n\u201cSo Brad, and Bob, and Lux, and myself are all part of the old school method where, it doesn\u2019t matter what the freakin\u2019 legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf**ker.\u201d -Aaron Black \\n(In regards to the \u201cDonald Duck\u201d characters showing up at Trump events): \u201cSkalar [Clinton operative] had gone to some buddy of his who is one of her body people and she explained the idea to Hillary. And Hillary just loved it. Let me tell you something, I think she has the right instinct here. This thing is working, is resonating but that story is not exactly what you want to hear about how presidential decision-making happens.\u201d -Robert Creamer \\nThe coordination between the Clinton Camp, the DNC, and Americans United for Change is a rather obvious violation of federal campaign finance laws regarding expenditures. DNC chair Donna Brazile was also involved in the coordination with the Clinton Camp as well. \\nAdditionally, Robert Creamer discussed why the Donald Duck idea had to be owned by AUFC and not by the DNC. \\n\u201cThe duck has to be an Americans United For Change entity. This had to do only with some problem between Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. That\u2019s why. It\u2019s really silly.\u201d \\nLater in the video Creamer revealed why that is the case: \\n\u201cDonna Barzile had a connection with them and she didn\u2019t want to get sued.\u201d \\nAnd finally, an explicit admission about Hillary\u2019s desires, straight from Creamer himself: \\n\u201cWe originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck.\u201d \\nWatch the full video below: \\nThis certainly seems to be illegal campaigning, based on these videos. One of the interns even stated that there was a whole slew of reasons why responsibilities had to be divvied up, because the whole scheme was a mess. And why is that? Because they are violating campaign coordination law, so they have to. \\nIt\u2019s truly unbelievable. A plethora of revelations now show us how corrupt Hillary Clinton and the DNC are, yet there are still millions of people that support them. If these revelations continue, and they still support her, what can you really say? \\nWhen corruption penetrates this deeply, and when the citizens still wholeheartedly back those who are driving the corruption, the country is in serious danger. \\nGod help us.\""}, "time": 1742563278.218753}
