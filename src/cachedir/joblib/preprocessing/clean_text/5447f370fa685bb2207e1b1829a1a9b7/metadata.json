Considered one of the great treasure houses of England, set amid the rolling green hills of the Derbyshire Dales, the estate has played host over the last 500 years to some of Britain\u2019s most captivating and infamous women, including: Bess of Hardwick Mary, Queen of Scots Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire Kathleen Kennedy, known as Kick (sister to John F. Kennedy) and Deborah Mitford, known as Debo. Their stories, and much more, will be revealed as part of an exhibition, \u201cHouse Style: Five Centuries of Fashion at Chatsworth,\u201d which opens to the public on Saturday. Curated by Hamish Bowles, international editor at large at American Vogue, and with creative direction and design by Patrick Kinmonth and Antonio Monfreda, the exhibition will delve into Chatsworth\u2019s rich sartorial heritage, using the lives of its   inhabitants and their glamorous guests as mannequins on which to hang stories of the wider history of the house. \u201cTo be let loose in the wardrobe rooms, the gold vaults, the muniment room and the closets, cupboards and attics of Chatsworth  \u2014   a place I came to as a little boy with a ticket in my hand and wonder in my eyes  \u2014   has been a truly joyous experience,\u201d Mr. Bowles said recently in a telephone call from the stately home. Lady Laura Burlington, the    of the current Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, conceived of the exhibition while hunting for a christening robe. She found umpteen perfectly preserved options complete with capes, underdresses and bonnets, which led her to wonder what else might lie undiscovered. Six years later, Mr. Bowles has seen his curatorial vision become a reality. The exhibition is organized by theme, including Coronation Dress Bess of Hardwick and the Tudor Influence the Georgiana Effect and Country Living and Entertaining at Chatsworth, though a standout moment for him may be a reimagining of the Devonshire House Ball, situated in the grandest staterooms in the house. Held in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, the ball, with 400 guests dressed as allegorical figures (and, crucially, photographed) was the grandest fancy dress ball of the century. Assistant curators for the exhibition spent months tracking down a handful of the original costumes, bringing them together for the first time since the night of the party. Mr. Bowles gasped as he described a Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, gown made by the couturier   Worth for Louise, the formidable wife of the eighth duke, and arguably the jewel in the display\u2019s crown. \u201cSo often,\u201d Mr. Bowles said, \u201cclothing is the most vivid entry point into getting a sense of how people of the past lived and existed in an environment or even a single moment in time. To create this exhibit on the landscape of Chatsworth, where so many legendary lives and moments have unfolded, has just been extraordinary. \u201d Lady Burlington, a former model and fashion buyer, said that her first meeting with Mr. Bowles was less than auspicious. \u201cWe met many years ago on an   fashion shoot for Harper\u2019s and Queen,\u201d Lady Burlington said, \u201cwhere Hamish was the stylist, I was the model, and thanks to an overly snug Vivienne Westwood corset, I promptly fainted. \u201d Mr. Bowles helped revive her, she added, by giving her a cup of tea and a biscuit. Luckily, their next meeting proved more fruitful. Beyond the historical gems they unearthed, the exhibition is notable for its wealth of contemporary contributions, with garments from modern fashion labels like Alexander McQueen, Erdem, Maison Margiela, Vetements, Vivienne Westwood and Gucci, the exhibition\u2019s principal sponsor. Last year, Gucci shot its 2017 cruise collection at Chatsworth, and the house clearly made its mark on the creative director Alessandro Michele, who said it was \u201cunlike anywhere else in the world, full of charm and rituals. \u201d \u201cYou can see history everywhere,\u201d Mr. Michele said, \u201cyet everything is alive. \u201d The most recent Gucci runway collection was packed with what Lady Burlington termed \u201cChatsworth detail,\u201d including fabrics, colors and bejeweled bugs and bees crawling over suiting and shirts. Given the calligraphy offerings on the Milan runway last month, Mr. Michele may also have been taken with the 11th duke\u2019s trove of novelty slogan pullovers, printed with phrases like \u201cGet Up and Do Something,\u201d \u201cFar Better Not\u201d \u201cAll Passion Spent\u201d and \u201cNever Marry a Mitford. \u201d The duke\u2019s wife, Debo Mitford (one of six Mitford sisters who dominated British high society in the 1930s) died in 2014, but she is represented in the exhibition. An ice pink satin \u201cCarmel\u201d gown she commissioned from Dior from its spring 1953 collection is a centerpiece of the show, while other highlights include her collection of bug and butterfly brooches and a pair of her favorite slippers, emblazoned with the image of Elvis Presley. Lady Burlington added wistfully that there might have been even more from the dowager duchess in the exhibition had she not willingly given away so many treasures. \u201cDebo kept some things for sentimental reasons but generally thought nothing of passing clothes on,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, her garments could turn up in the most unlikely of places. \u201d Lady Burlington recounted a story told by Charlotte Mosley about a time when the author had attended the local nativity performance alongside the duchess. The two had been sitting there for some time before the dowager suddenly sat upright in her chair, her eyes lit up. \u201cOh my goodness, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Lady Burlington said, repeating the account of the duchess\u2019 reaction. \u201cThe Angel Gabriel is in my Givenchy!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561651.1870587}
