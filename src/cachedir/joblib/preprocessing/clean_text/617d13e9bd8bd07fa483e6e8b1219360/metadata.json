I. investigation into her private email server, saying she \u201cmay have  \u201d in her remarks during a television interview on Sunday when she asserted that the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, had called her statements about her private email servers \u201ctruthful. \u201d Mrs. Clinton made the remarks while taking her most extensive questions from journalists in months  \u2014   after going more than 200 days without holding a formal news conference. She has been under fire from Republicans and others since her remarks Sunday on Fox News about her use of a private email server as secretary of state and the resulting F. B. I. investigation. While Mr. Comey did not recommend charges in the case, he said Mrs. Clinton had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her use of a private email server and contradicted statements she made about her handling of her email. In her remarks here before the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Mrs. Clinton tried to explain the discrepancy with what Mr. Comey actually said. \u201cI was pointing out in both of those instances that Director Comey had said that my answers in my F. B. I. interview were truthful,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the bottom line here. \u201d Mrs. Clinton reiterated her explanation that the classified emails the F. B. I. had identified as having passed over her private server were not marked classified at the time. The explanation did not appease Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to see why she hasn\u2019t held a press conference in 244 days,\u201d said the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus. \u201cHillary Clinton is once again proving herself incapable of telling the truth. \u201d During her remarks, Mrs. Clinton said she took \u201cseriously\u201d the problems she has had winning voters\u2019 trust. Questioned about why a majority of voters do not trust her, Mrs. Clinton referred to her high approval ratings when she was secretary of state and a senator from New York. \u201cWere 67 percent of the people in New York wrong? Were 66 percent of the American public wrong?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust maybe, when I\u2019m actually running for a job, there is a real benefit to those on the other side with trying to stir up as much trouble as possible. \u201d And she explained that the economic frustration driving many of Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters should be taken seriously. When asked about what Mr. Trump\u2019s millions of supporters, who are often drawn to language she and others have called racist and sexist, says about the electorate, Mrs. Clinton said that while some people were backing the businessman because of his \u201cbigotry,\u201d she acknowledged that many were motivated by economic hardships. \u201cWe have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that  \u2014   but let\u2019s not lose sight of the real pain that many of Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind. \u201d Mrs. Clinton also criticized Mr. Trump on Friday as someone who would be a dangerous president and stressed that if elected, she would work on issues related to systemic racism and the economy that often hit black and Hispanic communities the hardest. \u201cHe is harkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to stand up as a country and say that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t represent who we are and what we believe. \u201d Mrs. Clinton also vowed to push hard to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill with a path toward citizenship for those in the country illegally, and said she would prioritize the issue during her first 100 days in office. Mrs. Clinton joins a long list of political leaders who have spoken at the groups\u2019 conventions, which often focus on increasing diversity in newsrooms. President Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former president George W. Bush, Bob Dole and former Vice President Al Gore have all addressed past conventions. The groups invited Mr. Trump to speak, but he declined, according to the organizers. Before taking questions, Mrs. Clinton delivered a   address focused mostly on how her plans to improve the economy would especially benefit blacks and Latinos. \u201cRosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to open up every opportunity. \u201d Hovering over the address was the image of Mrs. Clinton addressing a room full of journalists. Although she occasionally holds informal sessions with the news media on campaign stops, Clinton aides have spent months explaining why she hasn\u2019t held an official news conference, as most candidates, particularly Mr. Trump, do regularly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a press conference when we want to have a press conference,\u201d Joel Benenson, the campaign\u2019s chief strategist and pollster, told ABC News last month. She even had some words of encouragement for the Fourth Estate: \u201cWe need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the hundreds of journalists attending the   conference here of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Near the end of the event, Mrs. Clinton talked about her   girlfriends, whom she rarely mentions in public. Asked what the most meaningful conversation she has had with one of them, she said she was \u201cblessed to have a crew of great friends. \u201d These include some of her most senior aides, including Cheryl D. Mills, Maggie Williams and Minyon Moore. \u201cI can\u2019t compress it into one conversation,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThey\u2019ve supported me. They\u2019ve chastised me. They\u2019ve raised issues with me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564365.4192598}
