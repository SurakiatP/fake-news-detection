S.  border, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s an easy one. \u201d  Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen \u2014  listen to this, it\u2019s never happened before \u2014  people can\u2019t even believe it. And by the way, don\u2019t even think about it. Don\u2019t even think about it. You know, they are trying to use the number against us because we\u2019ve done so unbelievably at the borders. They are trying to use it against us. But you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to stop the wrong people you need the wall. But listen to this, we\u2019ve already seen a 73 percent decrease  \u2014   never happened before on the southern border \u2014  since my election, you see what they\u2019re doing, right? So why do you need a wall? We need a wall. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll build the wall,\u201d he continued. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Don\u2019t even think about it. That\u2019s an easy one. We\u2019re going to build a wall. It\u2019s the final element. We need the wall. And it\u2019s a wall, in certain areas where you have massive physical structures, we don\u2019t need, and certain big rivers and all, but we need a wall. And we\u2019re going to get that wall. And the world is getting the message. They know that our borders are no longer open to illegal immigration and that if they try to break in, you\u2019ll be caught and you\u2019ll be returned to your home. You\u2019re not staying any longer. \u201d \u201cIf you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you will be arrested, prosecuted and put behind bars,\u201d Trump added. \u201cOtherwise, it will never end. Let\u2019s also remember that immigration security is national security. We\u2019ve seen the attacks from Boston to San Bernardino, hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with   offenses in the United States. We spend billions and billions on security all over the world, but then we allow radical Islamic terrorists to center right through our front door. That\u2019s not going to happen anymore. It\u2019s time to get tough. It\u2019s time we finally got smart. And yes, it\u2019s also time to put America first. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562790.4574764}
