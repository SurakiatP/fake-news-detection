Back then, James told me the woman who gave him the rug, a woman he had recently dated, was by then \u201cjust a friend. \u201d I didn\u2019t believe men and women could be \u201cjust friends. \u201d At least not if they were single, with one or both actively seeking a romantic partner. Yet I also agreed to be \u201cjust friends\u201d with James, at first. I was the one who contacted him. We had both joined a dating service called, pretentiously enough, The Right Stuff, after seeing an ad for it in The New Yorker. \u201cI liked your profile,\u201d he wrote in his first email, \u201cbut didn\u2019t contact you because you have a child. \u201d At least he didn\u2019t write, as several others had, \u201cThank you for being so honest. \u201d It\u2019s a line that makes you ask yourself: How could a mother lie about being a mother? Not ethically, but logistically? Maybe a liar would wait until the man is smitten, then spring the child on him and shout, \u201cSurprise!\u201d But to what end? I had tried to meet other single parents. I met a man who   about the $   child support his   demanded for his daughters\u2019 clothing allowance. I met another who asked how much I weighed, as if I were a chicken he was considering for a recipe. Then there was the man who told me about his summer plans to share a house with other singles on Fire Island. \u201cDo you do that every year?\u201d I asked. He let out of a puff of air. \u201cOf course not. Next year I\u2019ll be married. \u201d \u201cMarried to who?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. \u201d Meeting my eyes over his mojito, he said, \u201cMaybe to you. \u201d I also met plenty of nice men with whom I had nothing in common except similar philosophies on effective potty training. So when I saw the Right Stuff ad, I thought: At least someone I meet through an ad in The New Yorker will be someone who reads The New Yorker, and we\u2019d have that to talk about. Maybe I could find a man who reads the arts listings, and maybe even (if I could be this lucky) the poetry and fiction. I did. He was JamesNYC125. I was RedWeather. He responded to my first email: \u201cA redheaded editor in Brooklyn  \u2014   what could be better? But dating a woman with a child would be complicated, as I\u2019m sure you know. \u201d I did. \u201cLet\u2019s not date,\u201d he suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s just get together as friends. \u201d That summer we both had travel plans, so a whole month passed before our first date  \u2014   or our first \u201cplaydate,\u201d I guess. In the meantime, we emailed every day. I sent him poems. He sent me music. Even while discussing academic publishing, from my side as an editor and his as a researcher, we couldn\u2019t help flirting. An economist, he would answer a question with: \u201cProbability of 1. \u201d \u201cI love it when you talk math talk,\u201d I\u2019d say. And he would reply, \u201cI can do it any time you want. \u201d Our first meeting was on Smith Street. We talked books, then strolled to BookCourt, slid a novel off the shelf and read passages aloud. His timing was perfect, his voice what I\u2019d hoped it would be from the emails. \u201cI\u2019d love to walk with you on the promenade,\u201d he said, and then sneezed. \u201cBut I should nurse my cold. \u201d I wanted to nurse his cold, too. I wanted to boil him a pot of   tea and kiss him. Later I did, leaning against a car parked at a meter outside an elementary school. We both pretended I hadn\u2019t. The next morning, he called to ask me to a modern dance performance in two weeks. We both lived in Brooklyn but met, for the second time, in Manhattan. His hand grazed my thigh in the dark, a moment I would replay over and over in my head. For our third   I suggested attending a concert on a barge docked near the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. Our knees touched in our cozy seats two rows from the string quartet. Next we hiked Bear Mountain. \u201cI didn\u2019t think a skinny girl like you could outpace me,\u201d he said. Then later: \u201cI\u2019m only letting you walk ahead so I can get a good view from back here. \u201d So I vamped my hips. When we removed our hiking boots and socks in the car, we stared at each other\u2019s naked feet.   No. 5 was dinner at my place. Back then, the nicest thing I owned was also the first thing you saw when you entered: a red futon couch. I chose the cover from the remnants section of a fabric store on the Lower East Side. It was something I could unzip and clean whenever a child spit up, spilled Cheerios or wiped peanut butter on it. When I pulled a book off the shelf to show James, the Pok\u00e9mon cards I used for bookmarks fell out. Later, we found ourselves in bed. Finally. And that\u2019s when he confessed, \u201cI\u2019m dating someone else. \u201d She was a fellow economist he had met at a conference around the same time he met me, an   who lived in Washington, D. C. \u201cNow you tell me?\u201d \u201cYou knew we could only be friends. \u201d \u201cYou have sex with all your friends?\u201d I removed his hand from my belly. \u201cI bet she doesn\u2019t even know about me. \u201d I told him we had to either date or not see each other again. We were both traveling for Thanksgiving, so we decided not to email or phone until we returned home. Then he would call and tell me which woman he chose. Somehow I had turned myself into a   contestant, a   version of one of those \u201cBachelor\u201d shows my friends watch. I flew to Austin, Tex. to share the holiday with my brother. \u201cI\u2019ve met the one,\u201d I said. \u201cJust because it sounds corny doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t true. \u201d \u201cDoes he feel the same way?\u201d my brother asked. I asked myself that question from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed, and sometimes in the middle of the night, too. James and I had emailed every day for months, long letters detailing our whole lives. I kept checking my inbox in Austin, though I knew it would come up empty. On the flight home, I tried to imagine my competitor. She grew up in the center of an ancient civilization. I grew up in Detroit. Her furniture probably smelled like an exotic perfume, not peanut butter. She was not a single mother. He had already informed me about how complicated dating a single mother could be. Did I even have a chance? Trying to think like a statistician, I put my odds at  . Or, as an economist would say: probability 0. 5. Minutes after I arrived home, James called. \u201cI choose you,\u201d he said. I dropped the phone and fell onto the bare floor. Weeks later, he buzzed me up to his apartment. The door opened to reveal the most beautiful rug I had ever seen, so finely woven it was more like a tapestry. The kind of precious object that could be ruined by a few stray Cheerios crumbs. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift from a friend,\u201d he said. \u201cShe bought it when she visited her family in Iran. \u201d \u201cShe\u2019s trying to get you back,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat? She\u2019s just being kind. Don\u2019t you love it?\u201d \u201cSure. \u201d I loved imagining what I would do to it after it collected enough dust. I\u2019d take it outside, hang it   and beat it with a stick. But James turned out to be right. Sometimes a rug is just a rug. And sometimes men and women can be friends, even after they have been romantically involved. Rug Woman never tried to win him back. Time passed, and I asked James if he ever wished he had chosen her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect for me. \u201d Right. I wasn\u2019t the kind of person who would fantasize about walloping a beautiful rug. At least I wasn\u2019t anymore. Months later, James met my son, Jonah. I cooked Jonah\u2019s favorite, \u201cchicken with crumbs,\u201d and after our dessert of apple crisp, we played Clue. The next day, Jonah asked, \u201cCan I have another playdate with my new friend?\u201d \u201cWhich one?\u201d \u201cJames. \u201d Now we share the rug. It holds a place of honor in the house James and I bought together. We wipe our feet on the porch before crossing the threshold, food is banned from the entryway, and I vacuum it with care. I treat the rug as we all deserve to be treated. Like a friend.'"}, "time": 1742561651.9272065}
