So when former President Bill Clinton appeared on April 7 in Philadelphia at a rally for his wife, Hillary, Mr. Farmer protested, carrying a sign denouncing Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1994 crime bill, which set lengthy prison sentences and flooded the streets with police officers. A fiery exchange broke out between the activists and the former president as Mr. Clinton forcefully defended the legislation. But it was not just Mr. Clinton who criticized the young protesters. Afterward, some older   did, too. \u201cI think it is crazy to protest the crime bill,\u201d said Caryl Brock, 53, a social worker from the Bronx, who scolded the protesters on social media. \u201cShould it be amended? Maybe. But a lot of people really wanted it. I really wanted it. \u201d Young and energized   this election cycle are aggressively challenging longstanding ideas and policies, especially those carried out during the Clinton administration in areas like crime and welfare. But the activism is also laying bare a striking generation gap between younger and older   whose experience, views of the former president and notions of how they should push for change diverge dramatically. The parents and grandparents of today\u2019s young black protesters largely waged the battle for civil rights in courtrooms and churches. They carefully chose people who were viewed as upstanding citizens, like Rosa Parks, to be the face of their movement, and dressed in their Sunday best as they sought to gain broader acceptance. Mr. Clinton endeared himself to these generations by campaigning in black churches and appointing more blacks to the cabinet than any previous president had. But many of today\u2019s activists  \u2014   whose political consciousness has been shaped by the   killings of black people by the police  \u2014   do not believe that acting respectfully will protect them from being harassed or shot. They aspire not to become a part of the political system, but to upend it. \u201cYou do have older generations of church folk who believe that marching and singing is the best way to bring about change,\u201d Mr. Farmer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll march, too, but we\u2019ll do what we need to do to communicate our message, if it happens to be yelling, or blocking an intersection. And we don\u2019t care if people  \u2014   particularly white people  \u2014   believe it is respectable. \u201d The gulf between young black people and their elders surfaced repeatedly in more than two dozen interviews conducted in the days after Mr. Clinton\u2019s clash with the protesters. To young activists like Mr. Farmer, Mr. Clinton\u2019s legacy on crime is paternalistic and damaging. But many older black voters who raised families during the crack epidemic  \u2014   an era many young people do not remember  \u2014   remain steadfastly loyal to the Clintons. Ms. Brock said she had been a social worker in charge of the removal of children from dangerous homes in the South Bronx and Spanish Harlem in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when crack tore a path of destruction through those neighborhoods. \u201cI saw it all,\u201d Ms. Brock said. \u201cMoms would give birth and leave the hospital to get a hit. My car got broken into every week. People were scared to walk down to the bodega, afraid they\u2019d be followed and robbed. \u201d She said she was relieved when the crime bill passed. In addition to providing more money for prisons and the police, the law banned assault weapons and offered funding for drug courts and rehabilitation. \u201cBecause of the crime bill,\u201d she said, \u201canybody that wanted rehabilitation, we could process them and get them a detox bed in a hospital. \u201d Ms. Brock\u2019s comments underscore a sometimes overlooked reality in today\u2019s   of the crime bill: The legislation was broadly embraced by nonwhite voters, more enthusiastically even than by white voters. About 58 percent of nonwhites supported it in 1994, according to a Gallup poll, compared with 49 percent of white voters. Mr. Clinton has seemed rattled at times as he tries to defend the measure to younger   in an era in which concerns about mistreatment by the police and mass incarceration have eclipsed the fear of crime in many black communities. And among these younger voters, the Clintons lack the deep admiration that they enjoy from previous generations of  . In the Democratic primary contests so far, 92 percent of black voters 65 and older cast ballots for Mrs. Clinton, compared with 45 percent of black voters under age 25, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. Some   and older   found themselves siding with Mr. Clinton after his confrontation with the protesters in Philadelphia, which was widely broadcast on television and social media. During the exchange, Mr. Clinton said that the legislation targeted gang leaders \u201cwho got    children hopped up on crack and sent them out the street to murder other   children. \u201d He then lectured the activists, who support the Black Lives Matter movement: \u201cYou are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter. \u201d Roz Rodgers, 55, a community engagement worker from East St. Louis, Ill. said she understood what Mr. Clinton was trying to get across. \u201cAll black lives should always matter  \u2014   that is what Bill Clinton was saying,\u201d Ms. Rodgers said. \u201cIt bothered me, the reaction he got. \u201d About the activists, she said: \u201cThis younger generation is more vocal. They are not accepting the rules, regulations and expectations that exist. \u201d Today\u2019s angry demonstrations over   policies make it easy to forget how the former president was hailed two decades ago for taking a stand against gun violence in black communities. An emotional, unscripted speech Mr. Clinton gave in 1993 about the toll of violence on black youth has been called one the best of his presidency. He delivered it from the pulpit of the church in Memphis where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached his last sermon. \u201cThe other day on the front page of The Washington Post was a story about an    child planning her funeral,\u201d Mr. Clinton told the congregation that day, 10 months before he signed the crime bill. \u201cThe freedom to die before you\u2019re a teenager is not what Martin Luther King lived and died for. \u201d Black churchgoers gave him sustained applause and named him an honorary member of their congregation. A columnist in The Washington Post said the speech \u201cembodied what has always been the promise of Clintonism. \u201d \u201cOnly Clinton could say it, and only now,\u201d read a column in The St. Louis  . Willie W. Herenton, the first   mayor of Memphis, was in the church that day. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to lose the connection of where we were in 1994 and where we are today,\u201d Mr. Herenton said. The national murder rate hit a high in the early 1990s, disproportionately affecting   neighborhoods in major cities. Today, violent crime is down and mistreatment by the police and excessive incarceration have taken center stage in the minds of many younger voters. In 2013, nearly   of black men 18 to 34 reported being treated unfairly by the police in the previous 30 days, according to a Gallup survey. That has stirred anger among some young black people, which has crystallized in resentment of the Clintons in this election cycle. Charli Cleland, 24, a   student at Brooklyn Law School, said he planned to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders, even though his family has always admired the Clintons. \u201cGrowing up, there was always this idea that Bill Clinton was a man for people of color,\u201d he said. \u201cThen this political year comes around, and there is so much being exposed as to what they have said in the past and what kind of bills they have approved in the past. I\u2019m realizing that it\u2019s actually against everything that I initially thought about the Clintons. \u201d When he watched the exchange in Philadelphia, Mr. Cleland said he viewed Mr. Clinton and his remarks as \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and \u201cimplicitly racist. \u201d The interviews with the younger voters reveal a pattern: Not only are they distrustful of the Clintons, but they also appear disillusioned with politics and institutions in a way their parents are not. And they are less interested in gaining approval, especially from white people. \u201cWe do not believe that freedom for black Americans will come through politicians,\u201d said Erica Mines, an activist in Philadelphia who demonstrated at Mr. Clinton\u2019s speech alongside Mr. Farmer. \u201cWe can no longer rely on the ballot box for our freedom. \u201d Older generations fought for civil rights \u201cto be accepted into mainstream society,\u201d she said. \u201cBut younger folks are saying, \u2018I\u2019m not going to fit into that box anymore, or allow society to tell me what I need to be. \u2019\u201d Mr. Farmer said his mother, who put her faith in the ballot box, the church pulpit and the Clintons, initially found it hard to understand his brand of activism. \u201cShe just thinks in a way that is popular of a generation. Go in peace. March. Sing a hymn or two. Don\u2019t do any fighting. Don\u2019t do too much yelling,\u201d said Mr. Farmer, a former Marine. Mr. Farmer and Ms. Mines joined a group called the Philly Coalition for REAL Justice, which believes that only disruptive, direct action can bring about change. On Thursday, members of the group blocked an intersection to push for a $15 minimum wage and other measures. Both he and Ms. Mines were arrested. Mr. Farmer says his mother\u2019s views are changing as she watches his experience. \u201cI was locked up for about 27 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was at the precinct when I came out. She gave the police an earful. \u201d And, in perhaps a more surprising shift, after hearing what Mr. Clinton said in Philadelphia, his mother has decided not to vote for Mrs. Clinton for president, Mr. Farmer said. \u201cShe was a Clinton fan,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would have voted Clinton automatically. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563979.451252}
