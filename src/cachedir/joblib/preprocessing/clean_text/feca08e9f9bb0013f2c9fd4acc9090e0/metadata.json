[In her article \u201cLeslie Jones speaks out after harasser Yiannopoulos lands book deal,\u201d Lawler branded MILO with numerous false labels, while also claiming that MILO sent \u201cracist\u201d abuse to actress Leslie Jones despite a complete lack of evidence to support these claims.  \u201cAfter white nationalist and   poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos landed a massive book deal with a reported $250, 000 advance, publisher Simon  Schuster has come under harsh criticism from those concerned that a book will elevate the voice of the notorious Breitbart editor,\u201d wrote Lawler. \u201cYiannopoulos made headlines earlier this year when he was permanently banned from Twitter for organizing a targeted racist and sexist harassment campaign against Ghostbusters [2016] and Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones. \u201d Lawler, who previously worked for NPR and interned with Democratic congressman Patrick Murphy, is not the only journalist to have made false and unjust claims against MILO, with the New Yorker also falsely claiming that MILO led a \u201cracist online harassment campaign against the comedian Leslie Jones. \u201d As previously reported by Breitbart News, Jones had already been engaging with Twitter trolls for hours before ever interacting with MILO. \u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed (because you\u2019re work is terrible) play the victim,\u201d said MILO in reference to Jones on Twitter. \u201cEveryone gets hate mail FFS. \u201d Breitbart\u2019s Allum Bokhari also wrote on the issue, adding, \u201cIn other words, MILO has been permanently banned for little more than criticism, mild insults, and mockery. Meanwhile, [Breitbart\u2019s] Jerome Hudson\u2019s abuser, who repeatedly called the black reporter a \u2018coon,\u2018 is still on the platform. \u201d MILO has also sparred with various white nationalist and fringe sections of the right, so much so that white supremacist site The Daily Stormer waged a \u201cwar\u201d against him.   icon Richard Spencer has also dispelled claims that MILO is a part of the   stating simply that \u201cMilo is not a part of the \u201d during a debate. Many white nationalists have also branded MILO a \u201c  kike faggot,\u201d declaring their distaste for him. Popular   outlet \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d also bluntly declared in an article that \u201cMilo isn\u2019t one of us,\u201d while   \u201cleading thought leader of \u201d Paul Town also rejected claims that MILO is anything close to a white nationalist or in a member of the   movement, branding him a \u201ccultural libertarian. \u201d During numerous interviews, MILO has declared that he is not a member of the   nor a white nationalist \u2014   a label, which he adds, many white nationalists are proud to associate with, however the media has frequently attempted to pin him to the movement.  Numerous celebrities and media figures have thrown public tantrums over MILO\u2019s upcoming book release Dangerous, including Sarah Silverman, Judd Apatow, and Perez Hilton. Despite threats from the left to boycott publisher Simon and Schuster, the   version of Dangerous by MILO became the number one bestselling book on Amazon just a day after being announced and over two months before being released. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!  Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
