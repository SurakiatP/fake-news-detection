Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are going to steal the next election. \u201c I\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest ,\u201d he told a campaign rally last week. The mainstream media are trying to portray him as mad, but take a look at this evidence: \\n\\nThis is attempted election theft through manipulation of the computerized voting machines \u2013 and it must be stopped. The party in power in a given state controls the programming of the voting machines. When the establishment asked Trump if he would accept the outcome of the election a whole three weeks before the event, it was like asking a sports coach if he thinks the game was refereed fairly before the game is played. And the Democrats are now attempting to cover all bases. They are sueing the RNC over Trump\u2019s election rigging claims, and also suggesting if any evidence of voter fraud does emerge, then it is probably Russia\u2019s fault. Do not believe that voter fraud does not exist. It\u2019s real, the numbers are huge, and it\u2019s undermining true democracy in the United States. We must fight to eradicate it. If you notice any sign if possible voter fraud or election rigging, call the Trump Ballot Security Project toll free on 1-855-245-4634 or email [email protected] source:'"}, "time": 1742563247.1400986}
