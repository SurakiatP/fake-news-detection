It has been four years since Mr. Lin seemed to inspire New Yorkers and Asians around the world with his mystical, mythical string of performances with the New York Knicks. But now, as a member of the Brooklyn Nets, Mr. Lin says he has a different perspective on his fame and his popularity as the first   N. B. A. player of Taiwanese or Chinese descent. \u201cWhen it first started, I\u2019m not going to lie, it was cool, and then it became a burden,\u201d he said at the Nets\u2019 practice facility in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I had gotten myself into. One, two, three, four years later, every year I embrace it more. Every year I\u2019m more appreciative, every year I love it more. \u201d He is 27 now, and it is no longer enough to be just a leader for the Nets on the court. \u201cChinese people,   Asians, they always have a special place in my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cComing back here, I want to be able to try to inspire the next generation, reach out in the community. \u201d A Harvard graduate and a son of Taiwanese immigrants, Mr. Lin became an empowering figure not only for Asians, but also for underdogs,   Knicks fans and New Yorkers mired in the doldrums in February 2012. The team\u2019s leader, Carmelo Anthony, was injured when Mr. Lin was igniting a turnaround. Enter Mr. Lin, a journeyman who had been cut by two teams. Linsanity, in all its glorious euphoria, erupted. And then, several weeks later, Mr. Lin\u2019s run was over, cut short by a   knee injury, combined with the resignation of his coach, Mike D\u2019Antoni. After the season, the Knicks allowed Mr. Lin to depart to the Houston Rockets via free agency. \u201cAs soon as he took off that New York uniform, that magic was gone,\u201d said Andrew Kuo, 38, a New   artist and ardent Lin fan. The   artifacts of that time, like the sandwiches once named for him, grew stale. The puns faded from the lexicon. \u201cThe Lin memes are done, it\u2019s O. K. it\u2019s extinct now,\u201d Mr. Kuo said. There is, however, the matter of that \u201cLinsanity No. 17\u201d tattoo on his left forearm. Mr. Kuo laughed and said that it might have been dumb. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to look down and remember it all,\u201d he added. Mr. Lin recalled how he wished he had stopped to enjoy that heady time more while it was swirling around him. As for Linsanity, he may have won the trademark, but he has mixed feelings about it he does not intend to revive it. \u201cNot in a way that I\u2019m offended, but it kind of dehumanizes me to refer to me as a phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here, keep playing my game, and whatever you guys want to call it, it\u2019s up to you guys. \u201d It was typical humility from a man who at the start of his Knicks career in 2012 was sleeping on his brother\u2019s couch. In what seemed a quaint bookend to that time, Mr. Lin and his trainer, Josh Fan, stayed at an Airbnb rental on Tuesday night, just so they could be near the practice facility in Brooklyn. They turned down the Nets\u2019 offer of a hotel room. Mr. Lin, wearing a new hairstyle featuring tight braids atop his head, was officially introduced on a podium along with five other   acquisitions. Yet it is his celebrity that gives the lowly Nets an instant marketing boost while in what is otherwise a rebuilding mode. Since Lin signed his   $36 million contract in early July, the team\u2019s sales department has been contacting Asian groups all over New York to offer ticket packages. Brett Yormark, the chief executive of Brooklyn Sports and Entertainment, said that in response to Mr. Lin\u2019s presence on the team he had scheduled a trip to China to discuss partnership opportunities with travel and packaged good companies. \u201cOur brand is pretty big there, obviously,\u201d he said. As for closer to home? \u201cObviously, when you think of Sunset Park, that\u2019s an opportunity to ignite a potential fan base,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is under discussion. \u201d Mr. Lin\u2019s presence is sure to create ripples along   fault lines, even though his fame transcends that rivalry, uniting fans from California to Australia and to Taiwan, where he holds summer basketball camps. He recently returned from his annual visit. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of fans there,\u201d said Timothy J. Hwang, the New York bureau chief for Central News Network of Taiwan, who was among two dozen Chinese journalists covering Mr. Lin\u2019s news conference. (Mr. Lin gave his first interview in Mandarin.) \u201cHe attracts a lot of attention, especially for the younger generation,\u201d Mr. Hwang said. \u201cBasketball is the most popular sport in Taiwan. \u201d By moving back to the city with the largest Chinese population outside of Asia  \u2014   573, 388 residents according to the latest census figures, from 2014  \u2014   Mr. Lin will certainly gain a broader, brighter spotlight. \u201cI think he belongs in New York,\u201d said Jimmy Ching, 51, the proprietor of Pacificana, a sprawling dim sum palace in Sunset Park. Last year, Mr. Ching tuned all of the restaurant\u2019s 10 television screens to Knicks games when Mr. Lin played against them as a member of the Charlotte Hornets. \u201cWhen he was at the Knicks, it was this momentum and the people and the whole area were rooting for him,\u201d Mr. Ching added. \u201cYou see it in the Chinese communities. You see it in Brooklyn Chinese community, you see it in Manhattan Chinese community, you see it in the Flushing community. For that to happen, it was something. We pulled together. \u201d Mr. Lin\u2019s most ardent supporters see a different player now than the relentless, sometimes reckless, guard who once tried to prove his worth. \u201cThe definition of Linsanity may have evolved,\u201d said K. P. Chan, 68, a retired banker who lives in Bayside, Queens. \u201cThat was just sheer madness, that was epiphany. All the stars were aligned and all of a sudden, he had this breakout out of nowhere. But he has become a much more   more complete player. \u201d Last year, Mr. Chan connected with two California fans via an internet forum to produce a YouTube video that questioned whether N. B. A. referees were neglecting to call flagrant fouls committed against Mr. Lin. As the only   in the N. B. A. Mr. Lin represents a new \u201cmodel minority,\u201d said Peter Kwong, a professor of urban affairs at Hunter College. \u201cOn the one hand, he does everything Asians are supposed to do  \u2014   he went to Harvard  \u2014   and on the other hand, he\u2019s doing things Asians are not supposed to do: sports,\u201d said Professor Kwong, who specializes in Chinese immigration. \u201cThat is the charm of him. \u201d But the notion of a lack of athleticism among the Chinese seems to be an outdated stereotype, considering the popularity of basketball in Asia and the deep tradition of Asian basketball leagues across this country. \u201cPeople really don\u2019t understand how some Asian kids could be good,\u201d said Ryan Chin, 15, a mentor in a youth basketball league. \u201cI just want to thank Jeremy Lin. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562188.5465648}
