[That must be the conclusion reached by a California state senate committee that passed a $400 billion universal healthcare proposal Thursday with no funding plan. Yes, that\u2019s 400 billion with a B, which is more than twice the annual budget for the entire state.  Sen. Ricardo Lara (  Gardens) introduced SB 562, which calls for a sweeping overhaul of the state\u2019s health insurance market. His committee passed the bill with a   vote, clearing the way for it to be taken up on the Senate floor next week. But Lara has yet to reveal a plan about how the state would come up with the money to provide health care to California\u2019s nearly 40 million residents, including illegal immigrants. But in California, who cares about funding mechanisms? There\u2019s still that $68 billion \u201cbullet train\u201d out there going nowhere. The state doubled down on increasing services for illegals after President Donald Trump pledged to tighten the nation\u2019s borders. And just last month, the state legislature decided to levy even more taxes on gasoline purchases, as Californians will be paying $1 in taxes for every gallon of gas. And Democratic Gov. Jerry \u201cMoonbeam\u201d Brown had the audacity to lecture the taxpayers who complained about the added burden as \u201cfreeloaders. \u201d But this latest   whopper might be a bit too much for even Brown and California\u2019s Democrats, who own a supermajority in both the state senate and assembly, to swallow. Then again, maybe they believe in unicorns. Lara told the Sacramento Bee that he thinks it\u2019s possible to come up with a sustainable funding mechanism that doesn\u2019t overtax people and guarantees coverage for all. He never mentioned how. Lara said in a statement: Republicans in Congress voted to strip healthcare from 23 million people without a hearing or a fiscal analysis. We have already held two hearings and had an analysis, and I will be introducing a plan to pay for this program and cover every Californian. With Republicans determined to take away people\u2019s healthcare, we can\u2019t afford to wait. Part of Lara\u2019s rush is to appease a progressive base that\u2019s never shy about spending other people\u2019s money. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association, offered a   tirade at a rally for SB562 that ridiculed those who wanted a fiscal analysis as engaging in \u201c *** talk. \u201d California\u2019s Republican legislators  \u2014   what\u2019s left of them  \u2014   wondered out loud if their Democratic colleagues would eventually come to their senses. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about it as a concept that we\u2019re going to pass without any detail,\u201d Patricia Bates (  Niguel) told the Bee. \u201cI hope at some point rational thinking kicks in and we\u2019re not just driven by this lobbying effort. Good policy doesn\u2019t come out of intimidation. \u201d Don\u2019t hold your breath. Follow Samuel Chi on Twitter @ThePlayoffGuru.'"}, "time": 1742562087.6485093}
