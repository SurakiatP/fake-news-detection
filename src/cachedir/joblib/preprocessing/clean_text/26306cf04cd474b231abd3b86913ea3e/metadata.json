Y. \u201d and \u201cRides, Shops, Shows,\u201d several parking attendants pushed a sedan, its tires spinning, into a packed lot. The car\u2019s occupants spilled out, joining other families who   through snowdrifts  \u2014   just about everyone smiling, some tossing snowballs  \u2014   toward the entrance to Santa\u2019s Workshop, a theme park from another era. Inside, a line to Santa\u2019s house snaked toward a   North Pole, where families posed for selfies and a boy in a puffy snowsuit touched his tongue. Some families roasted marshmallows around a fire pit or wandered into the reindeer stable, where the animals were bedded down and out of reach of little hands. A boy raced from stall to stall, stopping in front of an empty one and shouting, \u201cWhere\u2019s Donder? Where\u2019s Donder?\u201d (Donder and Dasher, an attendant elf later explained, had been feeling ill so they were recovering in a nearby pasture.) While it appeared to be a   scene, Doug Waterbury, the owner of Santa\u2019s Workshop, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to keep the door open, frankly. \u201d \u201cWe lose money or break even every year,\u201d Mr. Waterbury added. \u201cAttendance is down. It\u2019s hard to get up in the morning to push snow, feed reindeer and then look at all that red ink at the end of the year  \u2014   and it\u2019s not red because of Christmas. \u2019\u2019 Santa\u2019s Workshop in North Pole, in Wilmington, N. Y. is among the last of the theme parks in the region, outlasting the Land of Makebelieve, Frontier Town, Time Town, Gaslight Village and other Adirondack roadside attractions. Since 1949, Santa\u2019s Workshop, an alpine village scaled for children, has welcomed families along the Whiteface Mountain Veterans Memorial Highway, a scenic road that meanders toward the peak\u2019s   summit. Today, the park\u2019s Technicolor   buildings and   rides are a kitschy throwback that draws dedicated fans fueled by nostalgia, who return with their children or grandchildren to share their childhood experience of seeing Santa and his reindeer. Near the Candy Cane Express train, Carrie McDonald, 41, who lives in Harveys Lake, Pa. and her sister, Erin Richburg, 37, who lives in Philadelphia, watched their children flap arms and legs into snow angels. \u201cWe came up in 1984 with our grandparents and have really vivid memories,\u201d Ms. McDonald said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it a tradition to come back. Right now we\u2019re choosing this over Disney. \u201d Ms. Richburg added, \u201cIt\u2019s   and simple. It\u2019s all about Santa. \u201d Standing by the park\u2019s outdoor amphitheater, where Mary and Joseph trudge to the manger, Corinne Curtis, her husband, Dave, and their children, Jack, Deacon, Kainen and Londyn, who range in age from 8 years old to 16 months, were back for a second year, visiting from their home in Binghamton, N. Y. \u201cThe   feeling is what appeals to us,\u201d Ms. Curtis said. And Santa, of course. \u201cHe\u2019s a sweet Santa,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cHe takes the time with them. It\u2019s not like other commercial places. \u201d But in the 21st century, a nice St. Nick might not be enough to sustain a theme park in a remote part of the state. Santa\u2019s Workshop\u2019s inaccessibility  \u2014   far from metropolitan areas, including five hours from New York City along twisty mountain roads  \u2014   is \u201cpart of the mystique of the place,\u201d Mr. Waterbury said. But it has also contributed to its decline. In 1967, the final stretch of Interstate 87  \u2014   through the eastern Adirondacks  \u2014   was completed, punching a direct route from New York City to Montreal. It bypassed communities with    motels and cabin colonies as well as diners and attractions that had flourished in the years after World War II. In the 1940s, when three businessmen, Julian Reiss, Harold Fortune and Arto Monaco, came up with idea of a destination where it was always Christmas, they hadn\u2019t anticipated     roller coasters or parks built around Walt Disney\u2019s characters. (In fact, before Disneyland opened in Anaheim, Calif. in 1955, Walt Disney visited Santa\u2019s Workshop for inspiration and to consult with Mr. Monaco, according to Mr. Waterbury.) The recession of 2008 pummeled the Adirondack travel industry. The unpredictability of the weather has also presented challenges, including Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, which damaged the park. Attendance has dropped steadily since the 1970s, and now the park attracts no more than about 1, 000 people on most days  \u2014   a far cry from the over 14, 000 customers who would show up in the 1950s. But the biggest hurdle for the theme park, Mr. Waterbury said, is the weakening hold that the story of Santa has on children today. In the 1950s \u201ca    might still believe in Santa Claus,\u201d Mr. Waterbury said. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual today that a kid over 7 or 8 still believes. There\u2019s an urgency to get families to bring their kids here before they grow away. \u201d In the lobby of the Jack Jingle puppet theater, where juice glasses, coasters and other memorabilia are displayed, Danielle and Paul Raimondi, from Center Moriches, N. Y. showed their daughters, Isabel, 13, and Sophia, 10, sacks spilling over with 60 years\u2019 worth of letters addressed to Santa Claus. After the girls wandered away, Ms. Raimondi whispered, \u201cA lot of people in our   \u2019s school were talking about not believing, and we wanted to show her that he still does exist. \u201d Mr. Waterbury, whose company, Empire Attractions, buys troubled assets, joined Bob Reiss, a son of Julian Reiss, as a   in 2004. A decade later he bought out Mr. Reiss after earning his trust that he was committed to keeping the park\u2019s spirit alive. Mr. Waterbury said he felt an obligation to loyal Santa fans, the community and the park\u2019s history. Mr. Waterbury recently hired a new general manager, John Collins, who has many years of experience in the theme park industry. They\u2019re trying to figure out ways to bolster summertime attendance, the workshop\u2019s most dismal season. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let it go,\u201d said Mr. Waterbury. \u201cThere are enough bad things. This place is about what\u2019s good in life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561828.4238005}
