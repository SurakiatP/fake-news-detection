[The request for just $1. 6 billion in wall funding is found in the budget document released by the Department of Homeland Security, which describes the agency\u2019s   plan for spending its overall 2018 budget of $70. 7 billion. According to the document:  A critical element of border security involves building the infrastructure necessary to halt the flow of illegal crossings.
