Really,\u201d he replied. Gabbana also apparently wrote to one commenter to say, \u201cvai a cagare,\u201d or \u201cgo to hell\u201d in Italian. This is not the first time the designer has taken on social media users over his show of support for the First Lady. In January, he excitedly shared a photograph of Melania Trump at the president\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party in Florida, during which she also wore a Dolce    black cocktail dress, from the company\u2019s \u201cCruise\u201d collection. \u201cHow many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram!\u201d Gabbana wrote in response to his critics, before telling everyone who didn\u2019t like his posts to unfollow him. Gabbana is one of several designers  \u2014   along with Tommy Hilfiger and Diane von Furstenburg  \u2014   who have said they would have no problem dressing the First Lady, after a number of other marquee names in the fashion world, including Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs, have said they would not design clothing for her.
