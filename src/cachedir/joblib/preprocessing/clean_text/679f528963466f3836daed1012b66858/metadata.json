What they did not tell her was that she could smile but not speak out publicly during the event, which is largely sponsored by Chinese companies. Over the past three weeks, as she and her fellow contestants have rehearsed for Tuesday\u2019s finale, Ms. Lin, 26  \u2014   an actress, classically trained pianist and outspoken critic of Chinese human rights abuses  \u2014   has been barred from speaking to the news media, friends and relatives said. They said that officials with the   pageant have also refused to allow Ms. Lin to attend the American premiere of a movie in which she appears. The film, \u201cThe Bleeding Edge,\u201d has angered Beijing with its dramatization of what human rights advocates describe as   programs that harvest the organs of Chinese prisoners of conscience. And last week, when a State Department official requested a meeting with Ms. Lin, to discuss the continuing harassment of her father in China, pageant executives refused to let her go, a State Department official said. They relented only after Ms. Lin agreed to be accompanied by a pageant employee, who insisted on attending the meeting. The chaperone later turned down a State Department request to post a photo of the meeting on Twitter. Jacob Wallenberg, a friend who has spoken to Ms. Lin by phone, said pageant employees warned her that she would be ejected from the competition if she spoke to reporters. \u201cThey have specifically told her not to talk about human rights during the pageant, even though that is her official platform,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is very frustrated. \u201d The Miss World organization declined to answer questions about the restrictions it has placed on Ms. Lin, but friends say they have little doubt about its motivations: Pageant officials, they said, are simply doing the bidding of the Chinese government, which has spent the past year trying to silence Ms. Lin, who was born in China but emigrated to Canada at 13. Since 2003, the Miss World pageant has been held six times in Sanya, a tropical city in southern China, and Chinese companies have become the main sponsors of the   competition. The local government has spent $31 million to upgrade infrastructure for the competition, according to the Chinese media. Last year, after the Chinese authorities refused to issue Ms. Lin a visa to attend the finals, she flew to Hong Kong, hoping to obtain a visa at the border. She was turned away, and her photo disappeared from the pageant\u2019s official website. \u201cWhy is a powerful country like China so afraid of a beauty queen?\u201d she said at the time. Beijing\u2019s efforts to silence Ms. Lin appear to have had the opposite effect. In the year since she was barred from the competition, she has been invited to speak at Oxford University, the National Press Club in Washington and the Oslo Freedom Forum. Ms. Lin has been especially outspoken on the repression of Falun Gong, a spiritual movement that is banned in mainland China. Ms. Lin is a practitioner of Falun Gong, which the Chinese government has deemed \u201can evil cult. \u201d Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, said that Beijing\u2019s attempt to muzzle Ms. Lin highlighted its increasingly aggressive campaign to shape global public opinion about a government that takes a dim view of   liberties. \u201cWhether it\u2019s choosing what movies you get to see or what information can be censored online, Chinese authorities are increasingly trying to insist that the restrictions they impose at home become the norm abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cThat they deem it necessary to try to manipulate international beauty pageants would be puzzling or quirky if it weren\u2019t indicative of a far more serious pathology. \u201d In Ms. Lin\u2019s case, the attempted manipulation has taken a sinister turn. In an earlier interview, she described how public security officials harassed her father, the owner of a medical supply company in China, and forced customers to withdraw their business, pushing him into bankruptcy. Family members said Chinese officials had also refused to allow him to travel to Washington for the finals. The Miss World Organization has been aggressive in its effort to prevent reporters from speaking to Ms. Lin. Two weeks ago, pageant officials interrupted an interview she was giving to Jeff Jacoby, a Boston Globe columnist, at a   hotel. \u201cTwo of them hustled Lin from the lobby, angrily accusing her of breaching the rules and causing trouble,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe third blocked me from talking to Lin, and assured me that my interview would be scheduled the next day. It wasn\u2019t, of course. \u201d Such restrictions apparently do not apply to the Chinese media. Over the past few weeks, reporters from two Chinese media outlets have been given free rein to interview contestants. Marion Smith, the executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a   organization that is sponsoring the premiere of Ms. Lin\u2019s film on Wednesday, said he felt deceived by Miss World officials, who he said had assured him they were relaying messages to her about the upcoming event. \u201cTurns out Anastasia never got any of them,\u201d he said. Over the past year, Mr. Smith said he had become increasingly alarmed by the growing reach of the Chinese government. Cyberattacks that the F. B. I. say originated in China have repeatedly brought down the organization\u2019s website, he said, and in June a teleconference symposium on the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 was disrupted by hackers. \u201cAt this point, nothing should surprise us when it comes to China,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the fact that the Chinese Communist Party is so threatened by a Canadian beauty queen that they would subvert the operations of an international organization supposedly dedicated to greater global understanding and the free exchange of views is very disappointing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563619.7878249}
