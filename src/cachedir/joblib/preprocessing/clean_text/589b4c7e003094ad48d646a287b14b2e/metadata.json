October 28, 2016 Jack Kerwick \\nJonathan Haidt, a professor of social psychology at New York University, argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional \u201ctelos\u201d (end or goal) has been truth, within the last few decades the university has assumed another: Social Justice. \\nThe university, however, can only have one telos. \\nThe conflict between these two goals has raged for decades, Haidt claims. Last year, though, it became unmanageable when student groups at 86 universities and colleges around the country issued \u201c demands \u201d to administrators, demands for Social Justice that, by and large, were met. \\nThe following statement is posted at BlackLiberationCollective.org : \\n\u201cWe demand at the minimum, Black students and Black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of Black folk in the state and the country. \\nWe demand free intuition for Black and indigenous students. \\nWe demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities.\u201d \\nA statement of \u201cprinciples\u201d follows. The Black Liberation Collective (BLC) opposes \u201canti-Blackness;\u201d \u201csexism;\u201d \u201cableism;\u201d \u201ccapitalism;\u201d \u201cWhite privilege;\u201d \u201cinequality;\u201d and \u201cheteronormativity.\u201d It rejects as well non-violence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic . \\n\u201cAnti-Black racism is woven in the fabric of our global society,\u201d says the BLC. \u201cWhen social systems are racialized by white supremacy, whiteness becomes the default of humanity and Blackness is stripped of its humanity, becoming a commodity, becoming disposable.\u201d \\nThe BLC is \u201canti-sexist\u201d insofar as it affirms \u201cthe value of all Black women\u2019s lives whether cisgender, transgender, or genderqueer.\u201d In addition to rejecting \u201cEurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of Black women and Black women\u2019s features,\u201d being \u201canti-sexist\u201d also means realizing that \u201cpolice brutality, the prison industrial system, school to prison pipeline\u201d and the like are aspects of \u201cstructural racism\u201d that affect black women as much as they impact black men. \\nBlack liberation entails \u201cqueer liberation\u201d and \u201ctrans liberation.\u201d \u201cWe also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize Black queer people,\u201d the BLC asserts. The \u201chomophobia\u201d within \u201cthe Black community\u201d comes by way of \u201cthe same hands responsible for white supremacy.\u201d \\nPresumably, \u201ctransphobia\u201d within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy. In cooperation with \u201ccissexism\u201d and \u201cthe gender binary,\u201d \u201ctransphobia\u201d has \u201cbeen used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans+ family members.\u201d The BLC pledges to \u201celiminate\u201d such systemic biases. \\nThese Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) are staunch opponents of \u201cthe capitalist notions of infinite profit, homogenized markets, and a privatized means of production.\u201d Capitalism, they insist, \u201cis the economic system\u201d that\u2019s been \u201cused to justify\u201d the \u201coppression,\u201d \u201cmarginalization,\u201d and \u201cexploitation\u201d of blacks. \\nNor is the solution to this \u201coppression\u201d to be found in supporting black-owned businesses. The BLC explains that \u201cwe cannot adopt the patriarchal, exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation.\u201d Rather, the solution is to \u201cdismantle anti-Black capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression.\u201d \\nIt isn\u2019t only the \u201ccapitalist corporations\u201d that these students want destroyed. They demand as well \u201cthe eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community\u201d and \u201cthe removal of all federal, state, and local government officials who do not abide by our principles.\u201d \\n\u201cThe State and all its institutions that deny Black humanity and Black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce Black liberty.\u201d \\nConcerning its attitude toward America, the BLC is clear: \u201cThis country was built to systematically oppress groups of people, and the Black Liberation Collective will not stand for it.\u201d \\nHaidt misspeaks in characterizing 2015 as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity, an unmanageable conflict of goals. To judge from the vast majority of liberal arts, humanities, and social sciences departments, Social Justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison d\u2019etre of the academy. Interestingly, it is these SJW demands from last year that bear this out. \\nPerhaps it is because I\u2019ve spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that I may be more privy to this than are some others, but it\u2019s painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own. If they didn\u2019t have their professors actually write the demands for them, then the Black Liberation Collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors. \\nTo put it bluntly, one must attend college, major in the liberal arts and humanities, and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of Social Justice Warriors. \\nLeftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will. This is the first point. There is, though, another, a rich irony that is lost upon these self-styled radicals. \\nFor all of their bluster over \u201csystemic racism\u201d and \u201cstructural white supremacy,\u201d i.e. phenomena that are omnipresent and, hence, largely unconscious, these black students, their white collaborators, and their professors fail to realize that their thinking (for lack of a better term) on these issues is about as Eurocentric as one can get. The \u201c critical race theory \u201d to which the BLC subscribe is a version of Marxism, the philosophical vision of a 19 th century German-Jewish man. The Marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men. \\nBut there\u2019s more to it than this. \\nThe idea that \u201cracism,\u201d \u201csexism,\u201d \u201chomophobia,\u201d \u201ctransphobia,\u201d \u201cableism,\u201d and the like against which SJWs rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of European civilization. If these \u201cisms\u201d and \u201cphobias\u201d are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual. Color, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individual\u2014but only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted. \\nYet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as Eurocentric as the proverbial \u201capple pie\u201d is American. \\nThe Social Justice Warriors\u2019 intellectual landscape is as much a European \u201ccolony\u201d as was any West African country in the 19 th or early 20 th centuries. Those in the Black Liberation Collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their \u201coppressor.\u201d \\nNow, they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in Social Justice.'"}, "time": 1742562545.9732182}
