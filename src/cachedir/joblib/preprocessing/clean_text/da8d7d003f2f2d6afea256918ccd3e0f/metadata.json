Despite the fact that the counter-bloc to NATO no longer exists, still this nature is impossible to eradicate for ideological and political reasons,\u201d Peskov is quoted as saying by TASS.  \\nThe approach of NATO military infrastructure up to the borders of the Russian Federation is a fact indicative of the aggressive intentions of the alliance. Meanwhile, \u201cin terms of ensuring its national security, Russia is acting within its borders and these actions do not threaten anyone,\u201d Putin\u2019s press secretary added. \\n\\nJens Stoltenberg earlier stated that NATO is planning to transfer a portion of its troops to strengthen its operations in response to Russia\u2019s activities.  \\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742562345.6957998}
