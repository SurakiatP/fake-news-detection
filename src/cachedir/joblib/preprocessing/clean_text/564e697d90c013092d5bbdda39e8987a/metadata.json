Bush to hilarious effect. \\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019d like to say something about my cousin Billy Bush. He\u2019s been in the news a lot lately. Him and that disgraced pumpkin, Donald Trump, talking on the bus. I just want to say ONE thing, we Bushes don\u2019t act like that, okay? We have standards, and we\u2019re raised certain way. We would never, under any circumstances, ride a bus. When you\u2019re a Bush, you ride in a limousine or a jump jet, or maybe a monster truck called Sasquatch Express. Never a bus.\u201d \\nFerrell then goes on point out that somehow, the utterly abhorrent character of Republican   has whitewashed Bush\u2019s less viscerally appalling but equally reprehensible legacy. \\n\u201cThis dunderhead is making me look great. I destabilized an entire region [Iraq], but no one seems to care anymore thanks to the Bozo Trump here. Folks forgotten how I tanked the economy or how I didn\u2019t get Bin Laden.\u201d \\nNobody should forget how the Great Recession was engineered and executed under the watch of George W. Bush or how the wars he began mortgaged our nation\u2019s future and led to the deaths of millions around the world. One shudders to think of what a President Trump would do to this country and the safety of the free world. \\nWatch it here:'"}, "time": 1742561661.1684468}
