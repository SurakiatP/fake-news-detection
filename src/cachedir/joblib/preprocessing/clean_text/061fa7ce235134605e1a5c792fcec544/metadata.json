Trump said on Tuesday that the judge\u2019s heritage does not make him  \u201cincapable of being impartial. \u201d Here\u2019s the statement his campaign released: It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that one\u2019s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial. Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report. Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And the response from students was overwhelming. Over a   period, more than 10, 000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University\u2019s programs. For example: Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University\u2019s   seminar \u201cexcellent\u201d in every category, but also praised Trump University\u2019s mentorship program in a glowing   minute video testimonial. When asked \u201chow could Trump University help to meet [her] goals,\u201d she simply stated \u201c[c]ontinue to offer great classes. \u201d Once the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyers\u2019 objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, but allowed the case to continue. Art Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump University\u2019s   seminar \u201cexcellent\u201d in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would \u201cattend another Trump University seminar\u201d and even \u201crecommend Trump University seminars to a friend. \u201d When asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohen\u2019s only suggestion was to \u201c[h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in\u201d and make the lunch break 45 minutes. Former student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative advertisements from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump University\u2019s programs \u201cexcellent\u201d in every category. When asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided \u201cmore comfortable chairs. \u201d Indeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www. 98percentapproval. com. For those students who decided that Trump University\u2019s programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within three days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any multiday program, whichever came later. Normally, legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment. However, given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade, I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial. I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies  \u2014   like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier  \u2014   are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage. Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the judge\u2019s reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the   judge\u2019s impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case. While this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case! Donald J. Trump'"}, "time": 1742628479.3155506}
