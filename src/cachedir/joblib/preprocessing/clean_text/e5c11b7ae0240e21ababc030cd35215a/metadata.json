[The proposal argues that Facebook was in part responsible for the fake news epidemic that leftists claim is gripping the United States, as it provides \u201ca financial mechanism supporting fabricated content\u201d online. Suggested areas for the report to cover include how Facebook evaluates claims made in posts and how their strategy affects free speech.  One part of the proposal highlighted some of the reasons why they believed the report was needed: Facebook is highly vulnerable, as fake news promoters are spamming their way to visibility for fake news through strategically gaming Facebook\u2019s algorithms and publishing platform  \u2026     In light of the societal crisis generated by the explosion of fake news and related hate speech, failure to effectively manage this issue creates public policy risk. Facebook\u2019s board of directors has recommended a vote against the proposal, along with shutting down another that would compel Facebook to disclose the pay gap between male and female employees. This may come as a surprise to some, as Facebook has recently been cracking down on accounts deemed to be spreading spam or fake news. On Friday, Facebook announced it was purging a \u201csubstantial number\u201d of accounts, created largely in South Asian countries that were spamming users. On the more political side of fake news, 30, 000 accounts linked to France were targeted ahead of their upcoming Presidential election as part of an effort to \u201creduce the spread of material generated through inauthentic activity, including spam, misinformation, or other deceptive content that is often shared by creators of fake accounts. \u201d Facebook has also enlisted the help of partisan \u201c \u201d organizations Snopes and Politifact, introducing warning labels on stories deemed to be fake news.
