Then on Tuesday, the president-elect tweeted in defense of the institution. \\nHe has so far attained 290 electoral votes, surpassing the 270 required to win the presidency. The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2016 \\nThe popular vote is still being tallied. Late Tuesday, the Associated Press reported Hillary Clinton had 61,438,917 votes, nearly a million more than Trump\u2019s 60,646,655. \\nIn the past week, over 4 million US citizens have signed a petition asking electors of the Electoral College to vote against the will of their state and in favor of Clinton to reflect the popular vote. The petition has met a lot of criticism, largely because the December vote of electors is mostly ceremonial, and the likelihood of such an unprecedented turnaround is extremely low. Trump wins Electoral College thanks to older whites, loses popular vote https://t.co/xag3XCCuQL pic.twitter.com/tLACODa0hM \\n\u2014 RT America (@RT_America) November 10, 2016 \\nThe history of the Electoral College goes back to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where delegates \u201c distrusted the passions of people \u201d and lacked faith in a direct democracy\u2019s ability to select a president. So, when the electors would gather to cast their votes, they were left to use their best judgment to make the choice. As the system evolved into a two-party one, the Electoral College ballot continued to grow with them and created a winner-takes-all policy for most states. \\nTrump is the fourth US president to win the Electoral College vote and lose the popular vote. John Quincy Adams, the sixth US president, won his election in 1824 through a vote of the House of Representatives when neither he nor Andrew Jackson won a majority of the Electoral College votes, although Jackson had won the popular vote.'"}, "time": 1742564058.3710034}
