Granderson argued that if Kaepernick remains a free agent when the season begins, then it would be \u201cjustified\u201d to say the quarterback has been \u201cblackballed\u201d by NFL owners. \u201cI know that [Kaepernick] is probably asking for a certain amount of money that teams haven\u2019t been willing to pay,\u201d Granderson stated. \u201cI also know that Kap is probably looking to be a starter where Fitzpatrick is just looking to have a job. With that being said though, when you see Mark Sanchez secure a job, when you see Ryan Fitzpatrick   \u2026     secure a job, you go, \u2018All right, this is adding more and more fuel to this conversation about whether or not Colin Kaepernick is unfairly being blackballed\u2019 because he has the courage to stand up for what he believes in. \u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019m thinking the NFL, if they start this season with Colin Kaepernick out of it, I think every bit of criticism about him being blackballed has been justified because if Ryan Fitzpatrick has a job making $3 million, the way he played in New Jersey?\u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742561696.341352}
