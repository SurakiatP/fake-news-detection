Ironically, shortly after the $20k donation wire was released, the contributor\u2019s \u201cniece\u201d was offered an internship with Creamer\u2019s firm, Democracy Partners. \\nIn the new video, Creamer says: \u201cEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters \u2026 I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising.\u201d He also mentions a conference call discussing a woman potentially coming forward to accuse Trump of inappropriate behavior. \\nCreamer, a seasoned Chicago activist who is married to Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), whose Republican opponent, Joan McCarthy Lasonde has called for her to resign over her husband\u2019s activities, also talks about his work with Barack Obama, whom he says he has known since the 1980s, when Obama was a community organizer in Chicago: \u201cHe\u2019s a pro, I\u2019ve known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago.\u201d \\nElsewhere, Creamer adds: \u201cI do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the\u2026 the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.\u201d In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer\u2019s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. \\n\u201cFirst thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I\u2019d like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I\u2019m going to make here is to my money guy and he\u2019s going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,\u201d said the PVA journalist. \\nCreamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the \u201cdonors\u201d \u201cniece\u201d \u2013 another Project Veritas Action journalist \u2013 was offered an internship with Creamer. \\nIn an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor\u2019s money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. During that meeting, Creamer spoke about connections he had with Obama and Clinton. \\nAUFC President, Brad Woodhouse, subsequently returned the money, after Project Veritas started to release their undercover videos, citing \u201cconcerns that it might have been an illegal foreign donation.\u201d Oddly, Woodhouse was not terribly concerned about the \u201clegality\u201d of the donation when he chose to accept it a month prior. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC\u2019s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn\u2019t been a problem for the month that they had the money. \\nWhile the latest video focuses on the \u201c $20,000 illegal foreign contribution\u201d from an undercover Project Veritas journalist , the following comments from Robert Creamer were also rather intriguing in light of recent White House efforts to vehemently deny any connections between he and President Obama. \u201cOh Barack Obama\u2019s was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. \\nHe\u2019s a pro. I\u2019ve known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago. \\nI was just at and event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues. Helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the\u2026the health care bill\u2026trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.\u201d \\n* * * \\nAs a reminder, video 3 directly linking Donna Brazile and Hillary Clinton to efforts to disrupt Trump events. \\nVideo 2 provided the democrat playbook on how to commit \u201cmass voter fraud\u201d: \\nVideo 1 revealed DNC efforts to incite violence at Trump rallies:'"}, "time": 1742561678.5307035}
