They are also calling on the stores that carry the brand, including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, to stop selling it.\\nIt has even created its own hashtag, #Ivankant, as well as #GrabYourWallet.\\nFrom The Daily Mail :\\n\u2018If Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her,\u2019 Shannon Coulter, who called on Americans to boycott the brand earlier this month, told the Guardian.\\n\u2018But something changed for me when that tape was released.\u2019\\nCoulter, who shared her own experience of sexual harassment at the hands of a male superior, launched the hashtag \u2018GrabYourWallet\u2019 on October 11, a reference to Trump\u2019s offensive \u2018grab them by the p***y\u2019 remark from the audio tape.\\nThe problem obviously for Ivanka, is that Donald Trump\u2019s base, for the most part, doesn\u2019t shop at Bloomingdale\u2019s or Nordstrom, which are two of the largest stores that carry her clothing line, along with Macy\u2019s.\\nWhat are your thoughts, should Ivanka\u2019s business be hurt because of the actions of her father?\\nFrom Politico:\\nThe New York Times cited a deposition from a woman who claimed that Donald Trump groped her under the table decades ago, but the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is certainly not a groper, his daughter said Wednesday.\\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not in every interaction my father has, but he\u2019s not a groper,\u201d Ivanka Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not who he is. And I\u2019ve known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women.\u201d\\nThe billionaire businessman launched a Twitter salvo the \u201cfailing\u201d newspaper for its \u201cfalse, malicious & libelous story,\u201d catapulting the story to become the newspaper\u2019s most popular of the year, according to assistant news editor Theodore Kim.\\n\u2014\\nIvanka Trump said she read the Sunday cover story and \u201cfound it to be pretty disturbing, based on the facts as I know them, and obviously I very much know them\u201d as a daughter and an executive who\u2019s worked alongside him for more than a decade.\\n\u201cI was bothered by it, but it\u2019s largely been discredited since,\u201d she said, referring to Brewer Lane\u2019s criticism of the report. Brewer Lane, the ex-girlfriend whose first run-in with Donald Trump was used as the lead anecdote for the article, titled \u201cCrossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private,\u201d accused the newspaper of putting a negative connotation on her words.\\n\u201cMost of the time when stories are inaccurate they\u2019re not discredited, and I will be frustrated by that, but in this case I think they went so far,\u201d Ivanka Trump continued. \u201cThey had such a strong thesis and created facts to reinforce it and, you know, I think that narrative has been playing out now and there\u2019s backlash in that regard.\u201d\\nSource RealTimePolitics.com Check out more contributions by Jeffery Pritchett ranging from UFO to Bigfoot to Paranormal to Prophecy\""}, "time": 1742561811.9071906}
