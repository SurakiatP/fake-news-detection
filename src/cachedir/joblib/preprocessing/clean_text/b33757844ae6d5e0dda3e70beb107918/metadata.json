Source tells @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump won\u2019t pursue investigations into @HillaryClinton for private email server use/Clinton Foundation. \\n\u2014 Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) November 22, 2016 \\nDespite all his campaign bluster, when he was calling Clinton \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d and promising that Clinton would \u201cbe in jail\u201d once he was president, it seems Trump has had a change of heart. It seems like only a month ago that Donald Trump told his supporters that: \\n\u2018This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I\u2019ve ever seen involving justice in the United States \u2014 in the history of the United States.\u2019 \\nIn fact, it was only a month ago. Trump promised his bloodthirsty supporters that he would \u201clock her up\u201d as president, and just six weeks ago Trump promised during the second presidential debate that he would appoint a \u201cspecial prosecutor\u201d to look into Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201csituation\u201d regarding her use of a private email server. \\nFive days after being elected, Trump did one of the most rapid walkbacks in presidential history when asked about that \u201cspecial prosecutor\u201d to throw Hillary Clinton in prison. When asked by 60 Minutes interviewer, Lesley Stahl, about his plans for the former secretary of state, Trump balked. \\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to hurt them. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. They\u2019re, they\u2019re good people. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\u2019 \\nThe same man who fanned the flames with supporters who called Clinton a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cevil,\u201d who exploited women who claimed that they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and laughed at as a child rape victim by Hillary Clinton, now wants the American public to know that Bill and Hillary Clinton are \u201cgood people.\u201d \\nOf course, it was never in question whether or not Hillary Clinton would be convicted of a crime or sentenced to prison, since multiple investigations by GOP-led committees regarding Benghazi and two investigations by the FBI regarding the private email server that Clinton and every modern predecessor of hers used turned up no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. \\nJust like every other promise Trump made on the campaign trail to attract voters with vengeance and hatred on their minds, it was all just smoke and mirrors. \\nFeatured image via Getty/Chip Somodevilla Share this Article!
