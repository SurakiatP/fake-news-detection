If anything, they tend to be a dull gray. The GOP nominee himself has even bragged about his loyal following of \u201cpoorly educated\u201d dumbasses from across the country. His most fervent backers tend to have shoe sizes with larger numbers than their IQs. \\nHowever, what Trump\u2019s followers are known for is their tendency to plan for retaliation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election on Tuesday. They have promised a civil war and bloodshed if Trump loses, which they are convinced could only happen if the election is rigged. When you combine these two traits, a penchant for violence and good old-fashioned stupidity, the result can sometimes be terrifying. Other times, it can be downright laughable. \\nThis would be a prime example of the latter. \\nMeet John. John vehemently supports Trump and his plan to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Fearing a Clinton presidency, he has decided that if she wins the White House, he will have no choice to engage in an act of \u201ccivil disobedience.\u201d You know, to show the government that he means business and all. Consequently, this brilliant man has managed to come up with the dumbest act of \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d ever. \\nSo just what does John the genius plan to do? He\u2019s going to block the drive-thru at McDonald\u2019s. After all, this is where all the illegal immigrants are working. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s his scheme in its entirety. Blocking the drive-thru at McDonald\u2019s. Because, that\u2019ll show \u2019em, dammit! John, 67, says if Trump loses he\u2019ll do civil disobedience like blocking the drive-thru of McDonald\u2019s where illegal immigrants work. pic.twitter.com/pESFnD83E2 \\n\u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) November 5, 2016 \\nTrump supporters certainly don\u2019t represent the best and brightest that America has to offer. But despite the fact that the majority of them are idiots, it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to fill out a ballot. These people will be voting. The only way to keep these racist morons from deciding the fate of the country is for Democrats to turn out in droves on Tuesday and defeat Trump in a landslide\u2026even if it does mean that grabbing breakfast at McDonald\u2019s may take a little longer than usual on Nov. 9 due to a crazy guy blocking the drive-thru. \\nFeatured image via Twitter'"}, "time": 1742563494.2495067}
