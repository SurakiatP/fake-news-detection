They would need to win three in a row from the Cleveland Indians, including two on the road, to make it happen. No baseball team has won quite that way since the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates upended the Orioles in Baltimore. But there is a recent precedent in sports: The Cleveland Cavaliers trailed the Golden State Warriors, three games to one, in the N. B. A. Finals in June, only to storm back and win the title in Oakland. It would be a cruel kind of karma for the Indians to lose in roughly the same way the Cavaliers won. But after four games of this World Series, there is little to show that the Cubs are up for it. The Indians\u2019 formula  \u2014   timely hitting and a few great pitchers  \u2014   offers a narrow pathway to victory, but the Cubs have opened the lanes for them three times. \u201cIt\u2019s just been abnormal in some ways,\u201d Cubs Manager Joe Maddon said, in a true understatement. The Indians carry 12 pitchers but basically rely on four, and yet they are one win from a championship. \u201cThey\u2019ve been outstanding through the entire postseason, and you can see it,\u201d Maddon continued. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously having a tough time, like the other teams did. \u201d The Indians swept Boston in their division series, holding the Red Sox to a . 214 batting average. They won four of five from Toronto in the American League Championship Series, holding the Blue Jays to a . 201 average. Now, through four games in the World Series, the Cubs are hitting . 204. Remember, these are the Cubs: the team that rocked the game\u2019s best pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, to win the pennant last weekend and outscored opponents by 252 runs in the regular season. The Red Sox had the   lead in run differential (184) in the majors, and the Blue Jays (93) ranked fifth. The old baseball adage rings true again. Good pitching (specifically from Corey Kluber, Andrew Miller, Bryan Shaw and Cody Allen) has throttled good hitting. Those pitchers have thrown 22 of the Indians\u2019 36 innings in this World Series, with a combined earned run average of 0. 82. The bonus was Josh Tomlin, who collected the first 13 outs of Game 3. Manager Terry Francona replaced him  \u2014   during a   shutout  \u2014   with Miller, who teamed with Shaw and Allen to preserve a   win on Friday. In Game 4, it was Kluber for six innings, Miller for two and, with a   lead, Dan Otero for one. Francona said Allen might handle the middle innings in Sunday\u2019s Game 5, with Miller positioned to finish off the Cubs at the end. Francona was too polite to frame it that way, but the Cubs are wounded now, and easily teased into taking the bait of the Indians\u2019 power breaking stuff. \u201cThey attack you, but I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s that,\u201d said the Cubs\u2019 Kris Bryant, who is 1 for 14 with three walks. \u201cYou see Miller and Allen, they don\u2019t walk a lot of people because they get a lot of chases. If we\u2019re able to do that  \u2014   lay off those sliders down and in  \u2014   maybe we walk a little more. \u201d The Cubs led the majors in walks this season but have drawn just four in their three Series losses. They also have just one homer in the World Series, a solo shot by Dexter Fowler off Miller in the eighth inning Saturday. When asked if there was anything positive for the Cubs to take from Game 4, first baseman Anthony Rizzo cited that moment, with a rueful smile. \u201cYeah  \u2014   Dexter hitting a home run off Andrew Miller, getting him to give up a run, finally, in the postseason,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cBut we lost. In the playoffs, a win\u2019s a win, a loss is a loss. That\u2019s tough. \u201d After the Cubs lost Game 3 of the National League Championship Series, falling behind two games to one to the Los Angeles Dodgers, catcher Miguel Montero said they needed to stop swinging for the fences and think smaller. The next night, a bunt single by Ben Zobrist started a rally that led to the first of three comfortable victories. Montero, a veteran who has not started in the Series, sounded a similar theme on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to hit a grand slam with nobody on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna happen. We need to be a little more patient at the plate, play a little small ball. We\u2019re all trying to hit the ball 110 miles an hour off the bat  \u2014   no. We need to get a ground ball through the hole. Simple as that. \u201d On Sunday, at least, the Cubs should have a decided advantage at the start, sending Jon Lester to the mound against Trevor Bauer, who lost Game 2 in Cleveland on Wednesday and has never pitched on short rest. But the Indians are changing the way to think about postseason games: If the starter falters  \u2014   and sometimes even if he doesn\u2019t  \u2014   an overpowering bullpen can take over early. The strategy has helped pushed the Cubs to the brink of elimination at Wrigley Field, where the Tigers celebrated a title in Game 7 of the last World Series played here, in 1945. A party seven decades in the making on the North Side of this city has turned into a letdown, and only a   can save the Cubs now. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for us to see the pictures of everybody outside, but we can\u2019t get too caught up in that,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHopefully we win out, and the last four games will be forgotten. \u201d But the odds will be firmly against the Cubs. Since those 1979 Pirates, only the 1985 Kansas City Royals have climbed from a   hole to win the World Series  \u2014   but they had the last two games at home. Over all, the last 10 teams to drop three of the first four games in the World Series have ended up losing.'"}, "time": 1742562274.8243225}
