Steve King ( ) blasted the angry left on Wednesday at the scene of a shooting earlier in the day that wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) an aide, and two Capitol Police. [\u201cAmerica has been divided,\u201d King said, according to the Washington Post. \u201cAnd the center of America is disappearing, and the violence is appearing in the streets, and it\u2019s coming from the left. \u201d  Asked whether the shooting was politically motivated, he said he did not know why the gunman did what he did. However, King pointed at anger and demonstrations against Trump, according to the Post: King, in his remarks at the shooting scene, said it was impossible to separate the hyperpartisan climate in Washington  \u2014   especially people protesting Trump  \u2014   with Republican members of Congress being fired upon at a baseball practice. \u201cThe divisions within the country, people that can\u2019t accept the results of the election that are determined to try to take this country down, take this organization down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis city was filled up with demonstrations the day after the inauguration, where you couldn\u2019t drive down the streets. And we\u2019ve had demonstrations every week since then, sometimes different topics. \u201d King added: \u201cWe do need to focus on what\u2019s happening to the culture in this country. \u201d The shooter has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson III, 66, of Belleville, Ill. by law enforcement officials. The shooting occurred early Wednesday morning at a park where Republican congressmen and their aides were practicing for an annual baseball charity game played against Democratic colleagues. Democrats were also practicing at the time, but in D. C. An FBI official told reporters at the scene that it was \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d if the GOP congressmen were targeted or not. Yet, a look at a Facebook page appearing to belong to Hodgkinson showed he was a Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) supporter who bashed Trump several times and liked an   cartoon.'"}, "time": 1742628527.1332004}
