In fact, how do you meet other single travelers or locals in the first place? And if you\u2019re looking for friendship  \u2014   or even something more  \u2014   how do you ensure that amid all the fun you don\u2019t neglect to take safety precautions? Before we get to tactics, it\u2019s helpful to know that you are likely to be rewarded for overcoming apprehensions about approaching someone new when you\u2019re on the road. \u201cIts easy to imagine all the ways things will go badly or believe that this person doesn\u2019t want to connect,\u201d said Nicholas Epley, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. But if you reach out, he continued, \u201calmost everybody reaches back. \u201d Social scientists have found that making such connections, whether traveling or not, boosts happiness, and yet strangers in proximity \u201croutinely ignore each other,\u201d as Dr. Epley and his colleague Juliana Schroeder put it in the Journal of Experimental Psychology last year. During a series of nine experiments, they saw again and again that we underestimate other people\u2019s interest in connecting. How to break the ice then? Dr. Epley suggests simply saying to that stranger on the bus or in the cafe: \u201cHi, I\u2019m visiting. Can you tell me what I ought to see in town?\u201d \u201cEverybody loves to brag about their city,\u201d he said. Or offer a compliment, he suggested. \u201cI think you\u2019re just best off in your relationships if you\u2019re transparent with people. \u201d (This is not to gloss over any genuine concerns about talking to strangers, Dr. Epley said. But we\u2019ll address those in a bit.) As experienced solo travelers know, opportunities for pleasurable connections are everywhere: trains, planes, parks, bars, museums, walking tours, group hikes. Yet should all that fail, technology provides seemingly innumerable ways to increase the odds. Obviously dating websites and apps like OkCupid and Tinder can facilitate     around the world. Yet the travel industry has its own tools, designed not specifically for romance, but for friendship. I\u2019ve previously written about some of these websites and apps, including Highlight and Planely. The app Skout enables travelers to meet locals or one another wherever they are, be it a concert in London or a soccer game in Barcelona. More recently there\u2019s Tripr, which allows travelers to find others who will be in the same place. But if you\u2019re seeking a   companion, a couple of veteran sites deserve another look. Unlike a lot of   aimed at connecting travelers, Couchsurfing. com was founded in 2004 and has grown to some nine million members. You may know it as the purview of frugal travelers who see the world by sleeping on the couches and air mattresses of strangers, but it\u2019s also a great way to meet other solo travelers and locals  \u2014   even if you don\u2019t crash on their couches. Some 120, 000 cities worldwide offer weekly Couchsurfing art gallery tours, hikes, dinners or gatherings in coffee shops and bars. (Becoming a member of the site is free.) In addition to joining events, you can also reach out to other members who have set their \u201chosting availability\u201d status to \u201cwants to meet up,\u201d meaning that while their couch is unavailable, they\u2019re happy to meet for coffee or be a resource while you\u2019re visiting their city. Another digital stalwart is VirtualTourist. com, which offers tips and reviews from fellow globe trekkers and has been around since 1999. That means you\u2019ll find a true online community, a deep well of people with whom to interact. Members have profiles that may include photos, their hometown, travel interests and where they\u2019ve been. Each member\u2019s travel tips are tied to his or her profile, and should you like what you read or have questions, you can message the user. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even get together offline. Once you\u2019re on the ground in a city, you can meet dozens of people at once by attending a cocktail hour, group run, or tour through the worldwide events site Meetup. com. While meeting someone new is exciting and can be deeply fulfilling, such overtures must be balanced with safety measures. Even Couchsurfing, which refers to strangers as \u201cfriends you haven\u2019t met yet,\u201d has a page devoted to safety, warning members to trust their instincts (\u201cIf a person, situation or profile seems unsafe for any reason, move on. Don\u2019t worry about seeming rude\u201d) and know their limits (\u201cPartying like a rock star might be fun, but it puts your safety and   in the hands of others\u201d). For women, especially, the site advises being educated about your destination\u2019s cultural and religious norms and to \u201cbe clear about your boundaries and don\u2019t be shy about stating them. \u201d At the same time, Dr. Epley said most people are not interested in taking advantage of you. \u201cThe person who wants to take advantage of you wants to find you immediately,\u201d he explained. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re the one who decides to initiate a conversation. \u201cWhen there\u2019s random selection, you don\u2019t have that risk of being targeted,\u201d he said. Solo travelers are often told to keep friends and loved ones informed about where they\u2019re going and when (including the time they expect to return) know which neighborhoods to avoid, and learn local emergency numbers. Additionally, consider registering with the nearest United States Embassy or consulate at Step. state. . This allows the embassy to reach you in an emergency (natural disaster, civil unrest) and family and friends to contact you if there\u2019s an emergency. You may also want to memorize words such as \u201chelp,\u201d \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d in the local language, and have a plan for how you\u2019ll get back to your hotel anytime you\u2019re out after dark. If you are in a place where there\u2019s no mass transit or if mass transit is not safe at night, have the number of a taxi service with you. If you use Uber, make sure the photo of the driver that appears on the app matches the face of the person who picks you up. Also, the Uber app has a \u201cShare my ETA\u201d option that allows you to send someone your whereabouts and estimated arrival time. (Before I even get into a car I send the driver\u2019s name, car make and my destination to a friend or family member.) The fear of strangers has deep evolutionary roots. Do not, Dr. Epley said, disregard your intuition. \u201cOur research does not suggest that you should talk to everybody that you meet or that you should have the volume turned up to 11 in all your social interactions,\u201d he said. It\u2019s just that for most of us, \u201cthe dial for engaging others seems set a little too low. Nudge it up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562329.3367767}
