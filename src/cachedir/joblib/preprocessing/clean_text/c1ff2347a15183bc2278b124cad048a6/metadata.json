Anthony Weiner, Abedin\u2019s estranged husband. \\nComey, however, said in his letter to Congress that he was only \u2018briefed yesterday,\u2019 meaning WND readers knew of the potential security breach two months before the director did. \\nAs WND reported Sept. 8 , Clinton forwarded an Aug. 8, 2009, email \u2013 clearly marked \u201cClassified\u201d \u2013 to a personal, nonsecure email address registered to aide Abedin, huma@clintonemail.com. Abedin then forwarded the message to another personal, nonsecure account, humamabedin@yahoo.com. \\nIn sworn testimony before Congress, however, Clinton declared, \u201cThere was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received.\u201d \\nThe 2009 email, sent to Clinton from longtime adviser Sidney Blumenthal, was discovered in a cache of emails obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The exchange concerned the \u201cdisastrous nature\u201d of an Obama trip to Germany, charging the U.S. was \u201ctotally out of the loop in Berlin \u2013 no ambassador,\u201d resulting in the expectation that \u201cGermans and Russians will now cut their own separate deals on energy, regional security, etc.\u201d \\nWND also reported two-thirds of Abedin\u2019s released emails were forwarded to personal addresses she controlled and Clinton\u2019s State Department chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, may have received classified information through personal email accounts . \\nIn WND\u2019s report of the marked classified email, Greg Davis, a U.S. Army veteran with more than 30 years experience as a military intelligence officer, told WND the handling of the message is \u201can obvious violation of national security regulations regarding the handling of classified information for which people normally go to prison.\u201d \\nDavis, the creator of the intelligence-oriented website SpookdBlog.com, said that typically the Justice Department would grant Abedin immunity from prosecution in return for her willingness to turn state\u2019s evidence against Clinton. \\n\u201cIf Huma refused to cooperate, the Department of Justice could threaten to seek a maximum prison term for her should their effort to bring a criminal prosecution against her succeed,\u201d he said at the time. \\nThe email containing marked classified information previously was released by the State Department, but it was unknown until the Judicial Watch released that Clinton forwarded the exchange to Abedin\u2019s nonsecure, personal Yahoo account. \\nSee the classified email: \\nH/T \u2013 WND \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.
