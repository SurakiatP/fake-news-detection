The room held a little black couch with a pullout bed he had slept on more times than he could count over the last eight years, during which he logged more than a million miles aloft. We were en route back to Wilmington, Del. from Cartagena, Colombia, in early December, and Biden was sitting in a black leather seat with a binder in his lap. It contained the speech he had given at the Democratic National Convention in July. He told me he had been rereading it. He began reciting aloud: \u201cIf you live in neighborhoods like the one Jill and I grew up in, if you worry about your job and getting decent pay. . .. \u201d His voice accelerated. \u201cIf you worry about your children\u2019s education, if you\u2019re taking care of an elderly parent, there\u2019s only one person in this race who. . .. \u201d He looked up at me and sighed. \u201cI wish to hell I\u2019d just kept saying the exact same thing. \u201d Biden was afflicted with regret. He was sorry that, on the campaign trail, he had spoken so often about Donald Trump\u2019s unfitness for office and not enough about what Hillary Clinton would do for the middle class. He was sorry he didn\u2019t push harder inside the White House for a   tax cut. And he was still torn over his decision not to run for president, a race that he said would have been \u201cbrutal\u201d but that he also believed he could have won. I spoke with Biden intermittently in the months before and after Election Day, and I had no doubt as to why he didn\u2019t jump in. He was still corny, gabby, lovable Uncle Joe, the guy who once said: \u201cStand up, Chuck! Let \u2019em see you!\u201d to a man in a wheelchair. But nearly every speech and interview now included some moving mention of his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, and how much Biden was doing, and intended to continue to do for the rest of his life, to speed the search for cancer cures. I saw Biden cry in Manchester, N. H. in October when holding an infant that he was told was named after Beau. I saw him near tears in West Mifflin, Pa. the weekend before the election, when he was joined onstage by the former Pittsburgh Steelers Franco Harris and Mel Blount  \u2014   which reminded him of the footballs the team owner sent to young Beau and his brother, Hunter, in the hospital after they were injured in the 1972 car accident that killed Biden\u2019s first wife and baby girl. On his deathbed, Beau advised his father to run, but many friends  \u2014   including President Obama  \u2014   didn\u2019t think he was up to it emotionally, and the vice president finally agreed. \u201cFor all that\u2019s important to me in almost a sacred sense,\u201d he told me mournfully, the decision was unavoidable. \u201cThe family was broken, and I was more broken than I thought I was. \u201d How broken? \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I was in a debate and someone said, \u2018You\u2019re doing this because of your son,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he told me one late November day in his West Wing office. \u201cI might have walked over and kicked his ass. \u201d And yet minutes later, he was standing at his desk, fidgeting and replaying what might have been in 2016. The South Carolina primary would have given him a strong start, he said, citing his internal polls there. \u201cHard to believe, but I was more popular with blacks than Barack was. \u201d Biden clearly loathes the new president he said during the campaign that if he and Trump were in high school, he\u2019d \u201ctake him behind the gym\u201d for the way he bragged about groping women. Trump reminded him of the bullies who teased him as a child on account of his stutter, calling him \u201c  . \u201d But the politician who has long believed all politics is personal wants to keep it impersonal with Trump. \u201cThe president and I have concluded that there\u2019s no value in making that ad hominem argument,\u201d he told me of Obama. \u201cIt gets you nowhere. \u201d Biden wasn\u2019t shocked that Hillary Clinton lost. He had noticed before the election that Trump was connecting with the people he grew up with in Pennsylvania. This shaped his thoughts on how Democrats should respond. When the subject of Trump came up aboard Air Force Two, Biden referred to a   story about how, as a freshman senator, he saw Jesse Helms, the archconservative North Carolina Republican, ripping into a piece of disabilities legislation. Biden was furious about it and began attacking Helms to Mike Mansfield, the Democratic Senate majority leader. Puffing on his pipe, Mansfield asked Biden if he knew that Helms and his wife had adopted a disabled    boy no one else would take. \u201cQuestion a man\u2019s judgment, not his motives,\u201d Mansfield instructed. Biden, who was invited by Helms decades later to give his eulogy, is convinced that absorbing Mansfield\u2019s advice is what allowed him to work with Senate Republicans during the Obama years, to negotiate the approval of the New Start    treaty, the end of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and the expansion of the   tax credit, among other accomplishments. His approach to Trump, he said, wouldn\u2019t be fundamentally different. \u201cIt falls in that category,\u201d Biden told me. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say: \u2018I think the proposal on the following is a serious mistake. I think it\u2019s gonna do the following damage.\u2019 It\u2019s another thing to say, \u2018The guy\u2019s a fucking idiot, and he is an egomaniac who\u2019s a whatever. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Biden suggested he might lobby former Republican colleagues when \u201ccircumstances generate blowback among mainstream Republicans. \u201d He remains in the shrinking camp that believes Trump may yet step up, at least a bit, to the demands of high office. His hope is that Trump\u2019s \u201csense of grandeur is so immense that he\u2019d rather succeed than unleash these forces. \u201d Given how many Trump voters would lose their insurance under full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he may well back off of repealing it, Biden said. As for the rest of his own administration\u2019s legacy, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to bet my granddaughter\u2019s college tuition, but it\u2019s less likely to be undone than frayed on the edges. \u201d Biden\u2019s biggest worry is that Trump, for all his bluster, could be a global bystander, unwilling to engage a messy world with anything more than  . \u201cThe question I get everywhere is: \u2018Is American leadership going to continue? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he told me on Air Force Two. If Trump \u201cjust stays behind the lines  \u2014   hands off  \u2014   it could be very ugly. Very, very ugly. \u201d In July, the president of Latvia asked Biden to fly there as soon as possible and give a televised speech assuring the Baltic states that the United States would fulfill its NATO obligations and defend them against a Russian invasion. He did so, emphatically, but his promises offer little comfort   Day. The prospect of Vladimir Putin fulfilling his dream of   Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe is not far from Biden\u2019s mind. \u201cNow if we walk away  \u2014   Hungary, Poland, even the Baltic states, these guys all start to hedge their bets,\u201d he said. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Colin Kahl, who was with the vice president on the plane, interjected to outline the contradictions in Trump\u2019s emerging foreign policy. If the United States is going to be more cooperative with Russia and Bashar  \u2019s Syria but more confrontational with Iran, Kahl asked, how will Trump handle them joining together to fight ISIS? \u201cIt\u2019s like a Rubik\u2019s cube trying to figure this guy out,\u201d Biden sighed. \u201cWe have no freakin\u2019 idea what he\u2019s gonna do. \u201d When they were Senate colleagues, and Biden was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Biden thought Obama was in too much of a hurry  \u2014   and Obama found the chairman a tad condescending. But in the White House, the two men became exceptionally close. \u201cThere was never a point,\u201d Obama told me recently, \u201cwhere I thought he was distancing himself from me or positioning himself. Never been a time when he wasn\u2019t telling me something he really thought. \u201d Their families, too, drew together. \u201cFamily has been central for us  \u2014   that\u2019s our baseline,\u201d Obama told me. \u201cWe both feel freer to do what we think is right because if it doesn\u2019t work out, our families will still love us. \u201d Biden later told friends that he thought the president was sincerely looking out for him in 2015 when he advised him not to run  \u2014   though he also felt Obama had grown fond of the bright mark he could leave on history by passing the baton from the first black president to the first female president. The big question now is when, and how, they will   the arena. Obama has already said that, unlike George W. Bush, he won\u2019t refrain from commenting on his successor. Biden may go further. Amid discussion of resistance to Trump, he surprised me with talk of 2020, when he\u2019ll turn 78. \u201cI\u2019ll run,\u201d the vice president deadpanned, \u201cif I can walk. \u201d Three days later, he informed the Washington press corps that he wasn\u2019t joking. Biden isn\u2019t likely to run, but keeping the door ajar gives him a bigger voice in Democratic Party debates. The one that worries him most is over repositioning to win back Trump voters. He has little patience with Democrats who want to move either left or right. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018We gotta move to the center,\u2019 \u2018We gotta move to those white guys,\u2019 \u2018We gotta move to those   people\u2019 or \u2018We gotta double down on the social agenda. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d It\u2019s a false choice, he said: \u201cThey are totally compatible. I have never said anything to the A. C. L. U. that I wouldn\u2019t say to the Chamber of Commerce. \u201d This was the vision of the Democratic Party to which Biden had dedicated his career. \u201cAmtrak Joe\u201d famously commuted every day from Wilmington to Washington  \u2014   three hours   for 36 years. He told me that as the train neared Baltimore, he habitually peered into the rapidly passing homes close to the tracks  \u2014   a flip book of   families of various backgrounds who might have recognized themselves in his convention speech. \u201cI wonder what the conversation at the dinner table is,\u201d he told me. Sometimes he saw his own family in the early 1960s in those houses. He imagines the families\u2019 struggles with everyday expenses: \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018Honey, we need a new set of tires, but you gotta get another 20, 000 miles out of them.\u2019 That\u2019s the goddamn discussion people are having! That\u2019s their lives!\u201d Before the election, Biden had begun to map out what his    plans would look like. Soon he would be back on Amtrak, riding to and from a   institute bearing his name at the University of Pennsylvania and a   center at the University of Delaware, and continuing the \u201ccancer moonshot\u201d  \u2014   a   initiative marshaling resources in government and the private sector to accelerate cancer research. In the meantime, he\u2019ll help play defense against Trump. \u201cEven if the Democratic Party didn\u2019t want me, I\u2019m not walking away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on this stuff my whole life. \u201d After Air Force Two touched down on the tarmac in Wilmington, I asked him about a line he liked to use before the election. \u201cSo do you still believe what your grandfather said, that God looks out for drunken Irishmen and the United States of America?\u201d Biden said he wasn\u2019t sure about the Irishmen, but he was about the country. \u201cI have to believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense being in this business unless you\u2019re an optimist. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562442.4330578}
