C. \u2014  Democratic lawmakers have responded with mixed reactions to President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to carry out military strikes on a Syrian air base that was the site of a chemical attack on Syrian civilians this week. [Approximately 59 Tomahawk missiles targeted Shayrat Airfield near the Syrian city of Homs.  \u201cI support the administration\u2019s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack. I hope this teaches President Assad not to use chemical weapons again,\u201d Sen. Bill Nelson ( ) wrote on his Twitter feed: I support the admin\u2019s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack. I hope this teaches Assad not to use chemical weapons again.  \u2014   Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) April 7, 2017,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) praised the strike but chided Trump for not consulting with Congress before carrying it out: Making sure that Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do. It is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it. I salute the professionalism and skill of our Armed Forces who took action today. Please see my statement following the US military strike in Syria: pic. twitter.   \u2014   Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) April 7, 2017,  The chemical attack killed least 72 civilians. Many of the victims included small children. Part of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s statement read, \u201cTonight\u2019s strike in Syria appears to be a proportional response to the the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons. \u201d She also sounded off on the president\u2019s decision to proceed without Congress, saying, \u201cIf the President intends to escalate the U. S. military\u2019s involvement in Syria, he must come to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force which is tailored to meet the threat and prevent another   war in the Middle East. \u201d However, in a   letter, she implored House Speaker Paul Ryan to \u201ccall the House back in session immediately to debate any decision to place our men and women in uniform in harm\u2019s way. \u201d She added, \u201cAs heartbreaking as Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attacks on his own people was, the crisis in Syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes. \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan called the strikes \u201cappropriate and just\u201c: Earlier this week the Assad regime murdered dozens of innocent men, women, and children in a barbaric chemical weapons attack. Tonight the United States responded. This action was appropriate and just. These tactical strikes make clear that the Assad regime can no longer count on American inaction as it carries out atrocities against the Syrian people. Resolving the   crisis in Syria is a complex task, but Bashar   must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course. I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort. While the strikes were lauded as a stark change from six years of inaction on Syria under former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, some Americans expressed opposition to the move fearing it might provoke another ground war. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ( ) said, \u201cIt angers and saddens me that President Trump has taken the advice of war hawks and escalated our illegal regime change war to overthrow the Syrian government. \u201d She added, \u201cThis escalation is   and will lead to more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of   and other terrorists, and a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia \u2014  which could lead to nuclear war. \u201d Progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) used the occasion to push for greater admittance of Syrian refugees into the United States. \u201cThe Syrian regime must be held accountable for this horrific act, and its actions underscore why the United States should embrace innocent people who are fleeing in terror. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742563787.093867}
