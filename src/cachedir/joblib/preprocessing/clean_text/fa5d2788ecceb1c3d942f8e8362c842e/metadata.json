He considered the hell of \u201cnothing remaining of my name,\u201d before concluding with an affirmation of his own legacy: That poem, \u201cForever,\u201d is part of a new collection, \u201cForever Words: The Unknown Poems\u201d (Blue Rider Press) to be published next week. Edited by Paul Muldoon, a Pulitzer   poet and Princeton professor, the book includes 41 works from throughout Cash\u2019s life  \u2014   the earliest piece, \u201cThe Things We\u2019re Frightened At,\u201d was done when he was 12  \u2014   that were among the papers left behind when Cash died in September 2003. In some ways the poems mirror Cash\u2019s songwriting, with terse ballads of outsiders in love, and parables drawn from the Bible Cash\u2019s version of Job is a wealthy cattleman who \u201ccried out in   he lost his children and his property. \u201d And for Cash, who in his last years drew a new audience with a set of stark and fragile recordings, the poems present yet another look at a legend of American music. \u201cI want people to have a deeper understanding of my father than just the iconic, cool man in black,\u201d said John Carter Cash, his son. \u201cI think this book will help provide that. \u201d Some poems in \u201cForever Words\u201d are unmistakably personal. \u201cYou Never Knew My Mind,\u201d from 1967, captures Cash\u2019s bitterness as he was going through his divorce from Vivian Liberto. (He married June Carter the next year.) \u201cDon\u2019t Make a Movie About Me\u201d rejects the Hollywood machine but then slyly gives advice on a film treatment. \u201cGoing, Going, Gone,\u201d from 1990, is a painfully detailed catalog of the ravages of drug abuse: \u201cLiquid, tablet, capsule,   and smoke and   payoff is the same in the end. \u201d At other times, Cash seems to tinker with his own body of work. \u201cDon\u2019t Take Your Gun to Town,\u201d dated to the 1980s, rewrites his classic 1958 song \u201cDon\u2019t Take Your Guns to Town,\u201d in which a headstrong young cowboy dies when he ignores his mother\u2019s advice. In the new version, a jaded man plans a \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d  rampage against \u201c  need silencing,\u201d but this time he listens. \u201cI believe he wanted to make a statement,\u201d the younger Mr. Cash said. \u201cHe owned guns. But he definitely believed that you do not need to carry a gun in your pocket to town. \u201d Even so, Cash kept that version private, although, along with a handful of the poems in this collection, the manuscript for \u201cDon\u2019t Take Your Gun\u201d was sold at auction. In his introduction, Mr. Muldoon places Cash in a poetic tradition that comes out of Scotch ballads, and also raises a point that was hotly debated after Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature last month: Are song lyrics really the same as poetry? Do lyrics lose something when removed from their musical context? Like Cash\u2019s lyrics, the poems in \u201cForever Words\u201d are written in plain language, usually with a clear rhyming meter. There are strikingly evocative images (\u201cThe dogs are in the   the huntin\u2019s lookin\u2019 good\u201d) as well as some   phrases about soaring eagles and hell\u2019s fury that might pass unnoticed in a song but jump out on the page. In an interview, Mr. Muldoon put Cash alongside Leonard Cohen, who died on Monday, and Paul Simon as examples of songwriters whose words hold up on their own. Even so, he added, the \u201cpressure per square inch\u201d on lyrics \u201ccan be a wee bit lower than in a conventional poem. \u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he continued. There are occasions when the simple, direct phrase is the one that works. \u201d Taken together, Mr. Muldoon said, Cash\u2019s poems have a broad sweep. \u201cYou still see the same scenes  \u2014   love, death, loss, joy, sadness,\u201d Mr. Muldoon said. \u201cThe great themes of popular songs, and, indeed, poetry, which we welcome hearing about and making sense of as we go through our lives. \u201d The poems in \u201cForever Words\u201d were chosen from about 200 pieces left by Cash in varying states of completion. Some may have been intended as lyrics, his son said, but it was not always clear. His father\u2019s papers, Mr. Cash said, included biblical studies and even a   copy of Gibbon\u2019s \u201cDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire. \u201d \u201cThey weren\u2019t hoarders,\u201d Mr. Cash said of his parents, \u201cbut they really didn\u2019t like to throw things away. \u201d The Cash estate has released a number of posthumous albums, including \u201cPersonal File,\u201d in 2006, a collection of intimate home recordings. A couple of years ago, Mr. Cash said, he was considering new projects with Steve Berkowitz, a producer and record executive who has worked extensively with the estate, and they began sifting through the poems. Looking to recruit Mr. Muldoon as editor, Mr. Berkowitz said he met him for an \u201c  breakfast\u201d at an Upper East Side diner and read him excerpts from the poems without revealing the author. \u201c\u2018This is pretty strong stuff,\u2019\u201d Mr. Berkowitz recalled Mr. Muldoon\u2019s saying. \u201c\u2018Who is it?\u2019 I told him, \u2018This is Johnny Cash. \u2019\u201d (In an email, Mr. Muldoon said he did not remember the meeting, \u201cwhich is not to say it didn\u2019t happen. \u201d) The Cash estate is already at work on an album of songs based on the poems, with musicians including Kris Kristofferson, Jewel, Chris Cornell and Jamey Johnson, in a project similar to Billy Bragg and Wilco\u2019s work with Woody Guthrie lyrics. The album is planned for release next fall. Over the last year, the Cash estate has brought on a new management and marketing team, and the album is one of many new projects. Also planned are a Broadway show and a Johnny Cash slot machine, and the trust recently registered trademarks for phrases like \u201cWhat would Johnny Cash do?\u201d to place on clothing memorabilia. When asked about these plans, Mr. Cash said that he and the managers of the trust  \u2014   of which he is a beneficiary  \u2014   strove to avoid crass commercialization, and also wanted to follow his father\u2019s wishes. \u201cWe try to live by the moral guide that he laid down,\u201d Mr. Cash said, which, among other things, means no alcohol or tobacco ads. \u201cBut he also did Taco Bell commercials. \u201d The goal of \u201cForever Words,\u201d Mr. Cash said, was to establish his father as a major poet and a \u201ccultural American literary figure. \u201d There is also a personal benefit. \u201cWhen I read these things, it puts me back in touch with the man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt lets me communicate with my father again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561851.2743804}
