The first actor was Natalie Portman, who is raking in rave reviews for her performance in the title role in \u201cJackie\u201d and is expecting her second child in a few months. The Bagger asked how she was faring on the awards circuit. \u201cWhile pregnant and sober?\u201d Ms. Portman dryly replied. The other actor was Colman Domingo, who played Hark in the slave revolt film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d which, for the first half of this year, before controversy engulfed it, was considered one of the brightest prospects for the awards season. He said now that the uproar had subsided, he wanted to share his frustrations and disappointments about how everything played out. \u201cYou walk into these rooms, and it\u2019s almost like a bittersweet look people give you in their eyes,\u201d Mr. Domingo said. \u201cI look at the work of my peers on the film, and I wish it was being celebrated. The cinematography, the music. Aja Naomi King\u2019s is one of the best performances of this year. But we\u2019re under the veil of the whole controversy, and people almost don\u2019t want to touch it. \u201d It is hard to overstate the ebullience that met \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d at its premiere at Sundance in January. \u201cBirth,\u201d which tells of the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in 1831, was the passion project of its director, writer and star, Nate Parker, who spent eight years pulling the financing together. The film arrived in Park City, Utah, just as Hollywood was fielding intense scrutiny for its   roster of Oscar acting nominees, and after a bidding war \u201cBirth\u201d sold to Fox Searchlight for $17. 5 million, a festival record. There were projections of awards, and while other films featuring black protagonists  \u2014   \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cFences,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cLoving\u201d  \u2014   have come to dominate Oscar chatter, \u201cBirth\u201d was initially at the fore. \u201cIt felt like the film had an urgency,\u201d Mr. Domingo said. Then, in the summer, after Oprah Winfrey and Spike Lee heartily endorsed the film, news articles emerged detailing harrowing rape accusations made in 1999 against Mr. Parker at Penn State, where he was a student and wrestler, and his roommate at the time, Jean McGianni Celestin (who would go on to share a story credit on the film). Mr. Parker was acquitted, and the case against the roommate, who was initially convicted, was reversed. After news broke that Mr. Parker\u2019s accuser had killed herself in 2012, the scandal went nuclear. It all came to a head at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, when audiences responded to \u201cBirth\u201d with standing ovations. At a jammed news conference attended by every lead in the cast, including Mr. Domingo, Mr. Parker deflected a pointed question (asked by the Bagger). Few would doubt the importance of the film, the Bagger said, but people were having trouble separating the artist from the art. And since the film\u2019s message was one of moral accountability, people felt Mr. Parker should offer his accuser\u2019s family an apology. Would he now? Mr. Parker demurred, saying he was there to promote the film and celebrate the hundreds of people who made it. At that moment, Mr. Domingo, who had been sitting near Mr. Parker on the panel, said he felt the wind leave his sails. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew that the 45 minutes of the cast speaking in detail about the film would be eviscerated,\u201d said Mr. Domingo, who is also a playwright and stars in television\u2019s \u201cFear the Walking Dead. \u201d \u201cI was disappointed,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would\u2019ve handled it differently. Could he have handled it better? I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to walk in his shoes. I try to deal with things in a different way. I think I\u2019m always trying to see the other\u2019s point of view, dealing in a very    way. It\u2019s    instead of   . But it\u2019s possible he felt embattled by the time he got to Toronto. This was something he created with the spirit of love and community, and suddenly he\u2019s battling other forces of something he dealt with 17 years ago. \u201d (Mr. Parker\u2019s acquittal came in 2001.) Over all, Mr. Domingo believed that Mr. Parker, whom he described as \u201cdeeply passionate, generous and kind,\u201d had handled the matter \u201cthe best way he can. \u201d Mr. Domingo also found fault with the Bagger\u2019s question, a criticism others have echoed. \u201cLooking back in hindsight, I can see Nate\u2019s point of view. Why apologize when he was vindicated?\u201d he asked. \u201cBut I believe with the media, you must answer every question in some way. And in very, very, touchy situations, we must answer every question again and again. Even if we\u2019ve said it before, we have to say it again. \u201d His   shared his discomfort. Aunjanue Ellis, who played Nat Turner\u2019s mother, wrote in Ebony that she \u201cagonized\u201d over how Mr. Parker handled the fallout from the accusations and that she grieved for the accuser and her family. Still, she urged people to see the film, as did the groundbreaking director Julie Dash, telling the Bagger, at the Toronto film festival: \u201cNo will always mean no. It will always be attached to that film. However, do not miss this experience of seeing that film. \u201d But people did miss seeing that film, in droves: according to Box Office Mojo, it has earned just $15. 8 million domestically. Its case was not helped by some middling reviews. But there is no question that the controversy dealt a death blow. (Mr. Parker\u2019s representatives did not respond to questions for this article.) Looking back, Mr. Domingo said he felt there was \u201ca huge takedown by any means necessary,\u201d not just toward the film but also toward black resistance in America. After a summer, he said, of \u201cdealing with black men on the streets and retaliation and Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, it\u2019s almost as if this film was too powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a big slap on the hand: Never try this again. Who do you think you are? If this were \u2018Madea\u2019s Halloween,\u2019 would they try to take it down? Absolutely not. \u201d While opinionators, including Damon Young of the digital magazine Very Smart Brothas, have dismissed the notion of a concerted takedown, it\u2019s hard not to compare Mr. Parker\u2019s scandal with that of Casey Affleck, the star of the current release \u201cManchester by the Sea. \u201d Mr. Affleck, who is white, faced sexual harassment complaints from two women  \u2014   neither of whom would comment  \u2014   and reached a settlement with them in 2010. Different circumstances, to be sure  \u2014   \u201cBirth\u201d also prominently featured rapes, while \u201cManchester\u201d is about a   family  \u2014   but, still, the matter has not seemed to hurt Mr. Affleck\u2019s Oscar chances this season. In the end, Mr. Domingo said, the controversy could be seen as a reflection of how he often sees his position in American culture. \u201cI feel in many ways as a black man in this country, you should apologize, or feel gratitude,\u201d he said. In recent days, Mr. Domingo said, he has discerned a shift around \u201cBirth,\u201d with more people being able to see it on its own merit. \u201cThis is one of the seminal moments in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the moments I\u2019m so proud of in every way. But you can\u2019t feel proud of your work without the other feelings on top of it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564013.6025827}
