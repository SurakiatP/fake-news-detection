[Indeed, ESPNW used a claimed \u201chonoring\u201d of National Poetry Month as an excuse to \u201creflect on resistance, redefining feminism and movement. \u201d  What followed were poems from five professors, writers, and activists filled with revolution, resistance,   and race baiting. The first piece, penned by Dr. DaMaris B. Hill, a professor of African American and Africana Studies at the University of Kentucky, is titled simply \u201cRevolution. \u201d It celebrates the violence and force of revolution, and is specifically dedicated to black power icon Asatta Shakur, who murdered a police officer in 1977. In 1979 Shakur escaped from prison and sought asylum in Cuba, where she remains to this day. Shakur was also the first woman named to the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted Terrorist List, and there is currently a $1 million reward leading to her arrest. Amusingly, Dr. Hill seems to admit that the liberals \u201crevolution\u201d has nothing to do with \u201cfacts\u201d by writing, \u201cRevolution ain\u2019t got sh \u2014   to do with facts. It is all faith!\u201d That sounds about right, since liberals have no facts or truth on hand with their \u201crevolution. \u201d It\u2019s all just a religion  \u2014   or a replacement thereof  \u2014   to them. After Dr. Hill, ESPNW moved on to a piece titled, \u201cWhat Leaps from a Storm\u2019s Throat,\u201d by   of Staten Island professor Patricia Smith. This second poem contains a line that slams capitalism, reading, \u201cbeneath vendors who heartlessly hawk the stupid slap of sugar, spirit and salt. \u201d Next, Wisconsin writer Carrie Ann Welsh\u2019s \u201cStart Here,\u201d seemed to posit that only minority women play sports, with a line saying, \u201cTheir bodies are too dark, too wiry, too big, too fast. \u201d Finally, New York arts and culture administrator D\u00e9Lana R. A. Dameron, made her entire piece about whites oppressing blacks. In Dameron\u2019s poem, entitled \u201cMy Struggle with Feminism is Black,\u201d black women are presented as having no freedom. Daeron insists black women are \u201cin the service of white folks. \u201d Dameron even poked her poetic finger in the eyes of liberal, white women who think they support the liberation of black women by noting that   white women found it easy to stomp around advocating for free black women when black women weren\u2019t teachers or even living in the same neighborhoods as those white women. \u201cDon\u2019t let those white girls turn you into a mammy. You are not there to take care of them, get yours,\u201d Dameron\u2019s screed said. So, as these \u201cpoets\u201d are pushing   race hatred, and resistance, ESPN is once again seen pushing far left,   liberalism onto its sports fans. Will they ever learn?
