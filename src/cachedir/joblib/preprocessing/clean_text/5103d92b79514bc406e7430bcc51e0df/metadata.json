He was just getting his license and registration, sir. \u201d By Thursday, Ms. Reynolds had given in to tears, fury and grief. \u201cShe\u2019s not calm right now,\u201d said an aunt, Joyce Doty, who lives in Indiana and was rushing to Minnesota to be with her niece. \u201cShe\u2019s a hot mess. She is very, very upset right now. \u201d About Ms. Reynolds\u2019s Facebook video, which had been viewed more than four million times by Thursday afternoon, Ms. Doty said, \u201cShe was doing what she had to do. \u201d Overnight, Ms. Reynolds, 26, has emerged as an extraordinary figure in the latest shooting of an   at the hands of a police officer. Apparently seconds after Mr. Castile was shot, she began to broadcast the scene live on Facebook, pointing her phone in the direction of the police officer, whose gun was still drawn, and at Mr. Castile, who was in the driver\u2019s seat and wearing a seatbelt, his   soaked in blood. In doing so, she became not only a poised and influential witness, but a teller in real time of her own treatment by the police. Ordered out of the car, then to kneel near the car, she was handcuffed and put in the back of a police cruiser. Yet the Facebook report continued, a mix of confusion, outrage, shock and poised determination to tell her version of what had happened. On social media and on television, Ms. Reynolds was praised for her strength. \u201cI truly believe Diamond Reynolds was spared her life because she\u2019s got a greater purpose,\u201d wrote the user @full_of_moxie on Twitter. \u201cShe\u2019s going to get justice for #PhilandoCastile. \u201d Mr. Castile, Ms. Reynolds and her    daughter spent part of Wednesday running errands and going grocery shopping, she told reporters. Around 9 p. m. she said, they were pulled over by the police, apparently for a traffic violation. While she streamed video in the aftermath of his shooting, dozens of friends on Facebook wrote messages of concern. Some said they were praying. Others urged her to stay calm and avoid angering the officer. A few tried to ascertain where she was and coordinate efforts to go pick her up. But she was taken into police custody immediately after the shooting and was not released, she said, until police officers dropped her off at her home at 5 a. m. Hours later, Ms. Reynolds stood in front of the governor\u2019s mansion, surrounded by crowds of people protesting the killing of Mr. Castile, who was a longtime employee of the St. Paul school district. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for pity, I didn\u2019t do it for fame,\u201d she told the cameras and people assembled. \u201cI did it so that the world knows that the police are not here to protect and serve us. They are here to assassinate us. They are here to kill us. Because we are black. \u201d It was unclear if Ms. Reynolds had slept since her boyfriend was killed. She met with Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, who later spoke about the shooting in unusually forceful terms, saying that he did not believe it would have happened if Mr. Castile was white. Ms. Reynolds, who goes by Lavish on Facebook, identifies herself on her page as a native of Chicago who works as a housekeeper at a hotel. She said on Thursday that she had no family in Minnesota. Family members said she spent her early childhood living on the South Side of Chicago. \u201cThey took my lifeblood,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThat was my best friend. I never got to say my last words to that man. \u201d Dawn Spikes, Ms. Reynolds\u2019s   said from her home in Chicago that the day had passed in a haze of confusion. For hours early on Thursday, they did not know where Ms. Reynolds was and feared that she had been harmed. By the end of the day, she was surrounded by friends and activists. The Rev. Al Sharpton, Ms. Spikes said, had called to offer plane fare to Ms. Reynolds\u2019s mother so she could travel from Indiana to be with her daughter. Ms. Spikes had not brought herself to watch the full video from Wednesday night. But she said she was not surprised that Ms. Reynolds, who she described as strong and outspoken, reacted the way that she did. \u201cDiamond was calm, and the baby was calm,\u201d she said. \u201cLike they go through this every day. But they don\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562976.1486769}
