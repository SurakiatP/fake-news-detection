And I, look BuzzFeed themselves said it was garbage. The New York Times wouldn\u2019t even print the document because it was unverifiable. This is what this is. There are tens of thousands of retired agents all over the world. You\u2019ve got some agent somewhere maybe in the UK that hangs a shingle and says pay me a rate I\u2019m going to do opposition research. He does a memo or she does a memo. This thing circulates for months. It\u2019s unsubstantiated and viola it shows up! I talked to Michael Cohen. One of the basis\u2019 of this entire report is that a guy named Michael Cohen who works for the Trump organization went to Prague and had a meeting with Russian agents. He\u2019d never been to Prague in his life. I don\u2019t know what it says about the report. In fact the coach of USC Baseball in Southern California said, wait a second. He wasn\u2019t in Prague he was with me in Southern California with his son. \u201d He added, \u201cAll I can tell you is the BuzzFeed memo, the salacious details in that memo, all of those things are total phony baloney garbage. It never happened. It isn\u2019t true. And what created the BuzzFeed article and I think most of what CNN\u2019s been talking about, I\u2019m not watching it   is based on this document for this opposition research guy that is based on nothing. That is not true. \u201d (  RCP Video) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562253.6556263}
