Although no Democratic senators have indicated they will be missing the inauguration, CNN has suggested that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) has left the door open for those deciding to do so. Schumer said, \u201cI think each person has to make the choice on their own, but I don\u2019t begrudge those who have said they\u2019re boycotting. Each person can make his or her own decision. \u201d Dozens of Democratic lawmakers announced they would not attend the inauguration after legendary civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis stated that he does not believe Trump is a \u201clegitimate president,\u201d that he is \u201cwrong\u201d for the nation, and that this is the first inauguration at which he will not be present. However, soon after he made his comment, a report surfaced that Lewis had skipped George W. Bush\u2019s inauguration because he did not believe Bush was the true elected president, thus it would be hypocritical for him to attend. Trump tweeted, \u201cJohn Lewis said about my inauguration, \u2018It will be the first one that I\u2019ve missed.\u2019 WRONG (or lie)!
