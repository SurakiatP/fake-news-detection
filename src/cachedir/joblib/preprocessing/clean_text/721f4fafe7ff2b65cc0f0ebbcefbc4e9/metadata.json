He used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning,\u201d read the statement from the terror state, as translated by   and the New York Times.  \u201cThe apostate Turkish government should know that the blood of Muslims shed with airplanes and artillery fire will, with God\u2019s permission, ignite a fire in their own land,\u201d ISIS added, in an apparent reference to Turkey\u2019s military operations in Syria. Although several terrorist attacks in Turkey have been blamed on the Islamic State, the New York Times notes it is rare for ISIS to formally claim responsibility for attacks in Turkey, possibly because it did not want to provoke the Turkish government into taking more severe actions against it. Turkey is now fighting both Kurdish militias and ISIS in Syria, announcing airstrikes on Monday that killed at least 22 ISIS fighters on Syrian soil. Leaders of the Kurdish separatists in Turkey, the PKK, condemned the nightclub attack, and insisted they had nothing to do with it. The attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul killed 39 and wounded 70 at last count. The Times reports 27 of slain victims were foreigners: \u201cSeven victims came from Saudi Arabia Iraq and Lebanon each had three citizens among the dead India, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia each had two and Canada, Israel, Kuwait, Russia and Syria each had one. \u201d Heavy. com notes that ISIS began circulating a message on social media in December warning Muslims that \u201cto celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve with the kuffar is to embrace their idolatry and paganism and to shun the rulings of our Lord. \u201d Kuffar is a derogatory term for those who do not believe in Islam. \u201cThere is nothing to celebrate. The Gregorian calendar is rooted in kufr and blatantly ignores the lunar calendar and that introduced to follow the Hijrah of our honorable Prophet,\u201d the Islamic State\u2019s theologians insisted.'"}, "time": 1742563404.045758}
