However, his operation was cancelled at the last minute because of problems with the previous patient. \\nHe says he then discharged himself from hospital and thought surgeons would call him in a few days to re-book an appointment, but claims they never did. \\n\u201cI\u2019d been told my leg would be cut off and I was taken into surgery. But it was cancelled. I just wanted to go home and see my wife and kids.\u201d \\nDibbins says he resorted to treating his own wounds over nine months using a Swiss army knife, sterile scissors and homemade dressing. He says he saw doctors every six weeks afterwards and they told him he could keep treating his frostbite until \u201cthings turned nasty.\u201d \\nRead more \\nHe says he eventually developed gangrene and his doctor said his infected toes would have to be removed. Rather than wait six weeks for the operation, Dibbins took matters into his own hands. \\nHe says the operation, performed without pain killers and in his living room while biting on a rolled up towel, took about an hour. His wife of 40 years was in the house but says she did not want to look. \\n\u201cKnowing that it would take at least another six weeks to get me in front of a surgeon again, that\u2019s when I bit the bullet and cut off the toes,\u201d Dibbins told the North Devon Journal. \\n\u201cI did it because it\u2019s what had to be done. My doctor told me my toes were going to kill me. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve had one surgeon say to me it was more luck than judgment, but then I had another surgeon saying I was mad but it was textbook.\u201d \\nA spokesperson for Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust told the Times: \u201cThe safety of all our patients is our top priority and occasionally it does become necessary for operations to be postponed, if there is another patient with a more critical medical need.\u201d \\nVia RT .
