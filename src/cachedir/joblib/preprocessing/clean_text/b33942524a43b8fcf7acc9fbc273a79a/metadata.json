The   company announced on Tuesday a partnership with Daimler, under which the German automaker plans to build autonomous vehicles that will operate on Uber\u2019s transportation network. The move marks the first time a major automaker will provide its own   vehicles  \u2014   built entirely   and without Uber\u2019s help  \u2014   specifically to operate on the   company\u2019s network. The agreement is not exclusive, and Daimler may produce autonomous cars for Uber\u2019s competitors, while Uber can also bring other automakers onto what it calls its \u201copen platform\u201d for ride hailing. The two companies said they expected Daimler\u2019s   vehicles to reach Uber\u2019s network \u201cin the coming years. \u201d \u201cAuto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars  \u2014   and in fact, making cars is really hard,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe can combine Uber\u2019s global   network with the   vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities. \u201d Uber has a history of cooperating with automakers to jointly produce autonomous vehicles. The company has worked with Volvo to develop the XC90, a   sport utility vehicle now being tested in Pittsburgh, near Uber\u2019s   research headquarters. Uber has also modified a fleet of Ford Fusion vehicles, outfitting them with sensors and cameras for autonomous capabilities. Lyft, Uber\u2019s largest competitor in the United States, has also worked closely with a major automaker, General Motors, which is making its own   vehicles for Lyft\u2019s   network. Google struck a deal with Fiat Chrysler last year to work on   vehicles. Uber stands to benefit from the Daimler partnership in several ways. Collaborating with automakers could reduce the perception that Uber is a threat to the sales of the auto industry, for example. The company can also bolster its supply of vehicles to pick up a growing base of riders. Uber faced some setbacks with its   experiments last year. It ended a pilot program in San Francisco in December after disagreeing with California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles over whether it had the proper permits for the test. Uber plans to begin a similar test in Phoenix in the coming months. \u201cDaimler aims to be a leader in autonomous driving,\u201d Dieter Zetsche, Daimler\u2019s chairman, said in a statement. \u201cTogether with Uber, we seek to combine our strengths. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563452.3775606}
