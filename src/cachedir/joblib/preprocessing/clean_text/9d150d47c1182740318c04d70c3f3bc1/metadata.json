Trump, with his hostility toward free trade and vow to protect entitlements, is a sharp rebuke to the   principles long championed by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. But if the Koch brothers have lost the battle for conservative values in 2016, they are also quietly preparing for a long war. Their secret weapon is the Grassroots Leadership Academy: a training program dreamed up by the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, the political education arm of the Koch network, and intended to groom the next generation of conservative activists to shape the future of the Republican Party. Taking inspiration from icons of the left like Saul Alinsky, the   Frankfurt School, and even President Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action, the academy offers classes like \u201cMessaging to the Middle\u201d (about reaching not just the conservative base but also persuadable voters) community organizing and how to wage a successful public protest, complete with costumes. The goal is not just to equip activists to compete with the left, but also to help rebuild the conservative movement in the wake of a Trump loss  \u2014   or even a Trump victory. The Kochs will be key figures in any discussion about what direction the party takes after 2016, and they are determined to steer it toward their   vision. A band of trained volunteers focused on elections farther down the ballot could help raise their standing for 2018 and beyond. The network hopes that these activists will learn how to make a compelling, personal pitch to win over new converts to the cause, and that if volunteers are grounded in a strong philosophical understanding of   principles, they will be better prepared not only to explain their beliefs but also to ward off candidates, like Mr. Trump, who do not espouse their vision. \u201cWe want a cultural shift of people being able to know what they want and how to talk to the people in their communities, so that in the future, when there are political leaders that want to demagogue   issues, they do hit resistance,\u201d said Levi Russell, the director of public affairs for Americans for Prosperity. After Americans for Prosperity spent more than $100 million during the 2012 election, yet failed to take back the White House or the Senate, the Koch network undertook a major   and overhaul. It is spending $3 million on the training initiative, which officially began in February 2015, and plans to expand it next year. The effort has taken on newfound urgency because Mr. Trump has shown that Republican voters will support a candidate who denounces trade agreements and rejects the   doctrine the Kochs have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to push. \u201cThis Republican nomination battle for president has demonstrated that no issue is ever fully won,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cYou must keep competing and explaining. For example, why free trade is better, why entitlement reform is necessary. \u201d The group has held training sessions in roughly three dozen states, and about 10, 000 people have attended an academy program. The academy offers three tiers: two   courses and, for those who have completed the first two levels, a final, intensive   training at Americans for Prosperity\u2019s headquarters here, with hotel and travel expenses underwritten by the group. The first level introduces trainees to the principles of economic freedom and prepares them, for example, to lobby their representatives about a particular issue. The second level of training seeks to turn the attendees into community activists, the sorts of people who could recruit and mobilize others. The curriculum is likely to intensify criticism of the Kochs, whose fortune is based largely on oil and petroleum, from liberals who view the brothers\u2019 political work as stemming largely from their financial interests. One of the sessions, called the \u201cMoral Case for Fossil Fuels,\u201d teaches attendees to argue that \u201ca turn away from fossil fuel use would ultimately be disastrous to humanity  \u2014   especially the poorest of the poor. \u201d Slade O\u2019Brien, vice president of the Grassroots Leadership Academy, said he had learned two big lessons from studying Democratic tactics. \u201cIt was incredibly   it was truly at the   level,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t have to agree on everything to agree to work on something  \u2014   that incremental victories matter, and they would work on those rather than swing for the fences and try to hit a home run. \u201d In Bethlehem, Pa. the second session of the   training program was held in a conference room over the beer and liquor section of a Wegmans grocery. Fifteen people munched on turkey wraps and miniature cannoli as they listened to Mary Conway, a Republican organizer who worked for Senator John McCain\u2019s and Sarah Palin\u2019s 2008 campaign, run briskly through a series of slides with labels like \u201cThe Left Is Highly Organized\u201d and quotations from Mr. Alinsky\u2019s \u201cRules for Radicals. \u201d With the   intonation of a motivational speaker, Ms. Conway urged her students to focus on what makes a successful movement. \u201cSuccessful or Unsuccessful,\u201d read slides listing various movements, one of which was the civil rights fight of the 1950s and 1960s. \u201cOne thing the civil rights movement was very good at was capturing the new media,\u201d Ms. Conway said. Several attendees were activists from local Tea Party groups. One was a political blogger. They offered their views on successful political movements  \u2014   and, during a break, on the presidential race. It was a reminder that the network cannot always control who shows up. Charlie Knight, 70, a   electrician who supports Mr. Trump, said he had come to the training because he wanted to be around \u201c  people. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s only one person that I could possibly support, because the other one\u2019s nothing but a liar,\u201d Mr. Knight said. Mr. O\u2019Brien, the Grassroots vice president, said he hoped the program would pay dividends over the long term. \u201cYou can\u2019t just show up at somebody\u2019s door six weeks before an election and build a relationship with them,\u201d he said. He added that Mr. Obama\u2019s   wing was \u201cmagnificent at building up their volunteers and relationships over a period of time, and you have to give them credit. \u201d The leadership academy program still has some work to do. Though the Kochs have tried to make the conservative base more diverse, in a recent training session near Washington, the class of roughly two dozen was mostly older and white. While some of the budding activists seemed equipped to return home and wage a successful   campaign, others seemed generally befuddled and uncomfortable with even the basics of social media, like Twitter and digital video. At one point, a man briefly dozed off during a session on the legislative process. \u201cThe big question going forward is what are the programs that these people get plugged into once they\u2019re ready to get involved in politics,\u201d said Sasha Issenberg, the author of \u201cVictory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,\u201d a book the program\u2019s leaders have consulted. \u201cWhat the left has been very good about doing is taking enthusiastic activists, giving them training, but then plugging them into systems where their energy is well directed. \u201d Near the end of a Friday session in Arlington, the trainees divided into several teams. Each team had a designated \u201cbuilder\u201d whose goal was to recreate a small widget out of building blocks using only descriptions from teammates, relayed from one person to the next in what was, basically, a giant game of telephone. Some teams did better than others, but the description became increasingly garbled as it passed from person to person. The real point of the exercise, a moderator explained, was that \u201cyou constantly have to be working on communication skills if you want to be a   leader. \u201d But when he asked the group what the lesson was, someone shouted out a message perhaps even more aligned with the project\u2019s stated aim: \u201cCut out the bureaucracy!\u201d the attendee said, to laughter. \u201cYeah, cut out the middle man and just say it right to the builder,\u201d the moderator conceded.'"}, "time": 1742564195.012495}
