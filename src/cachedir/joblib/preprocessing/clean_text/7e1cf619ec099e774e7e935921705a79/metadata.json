Included among those topics were criticisms that Breitbart News is a \u201chate site,\u201d the site\u2019s relationship with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, and the site\u2019s mission. Transcript as follows: GOSK: You know, Breitbart is one of President Trump\u2019s favorite news sources, once run by his top adviser, Steve Bannon. They see themselves as provocateurs, poking a finger in the eye of the mainstream media. But critics call them racists,   and white supremacists. We sat down with Alex Marlow, the       who pushes back against critics and the labels, defending the news site he\u2019s worked at since it started in 2007. MARLOW: We\u2019re not a hate site. GOSK: Do you think you\u2019ve been unfairly demonized? MARLOW: Oh, absolutely. Without a doubt. GOSK: Breitbart has seen a meteoric rise, from a fringe   once run by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, the   news site explode exploded during the course of the presidential campaign with 240 million views a month. There was a former employee of yours, who called Breitbart \u201cTrumpbart. \u201d MARLOW: Yes. GOSK: Was that a fair criticism during the election? MARLOW: Absolutely unfair criticism. GOSK: He insists they will criticize the president if he breaks his promises. MARLOW: If he makes good on those promises, he is going to get a lot of favorable coverage. When we feel like the president is not honoring the pledges he made to the public, he\u2019s going to get critical coverage. GOSK: Do you talk to the president? MARLOW: I\u2019ve spoken to the president on air, I believe, four times  \u2014   twice when he was a candidate, twice before he was a candidate. And I have not spoken to him other than   \u2026     since he\u2019s been elected. GOSK: How about Steve Bannon? Does he reach out? MARLOW: Every so often. Not as often as I would have expected. I think Steve is a very busy man these days. GOSK: Still, the White House and Breitbart seem to be in lockstep on most issues. President Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated tweets that President Obama wiretapped him during the campaign, echoed an idea laid out in a Breitbart article published the day before. Was the wiretap tweet because of a Breitbart article? MARLOW: That I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard things, probably similar things to you. And I heard that a Breitbart article played a big factor in it. GOSK: The article never goes as far as Trump does, directly accusing his predecessor. But it argues that steps taken to investigate the Trump campaign\u2019s links with Russia are purely political. MARLOW: We\u2019ve learned very little about any sort of nefarious connection between Trump and Russia. But what we have learned is there\u2019s these incredible amount of leaks flooding out of Washington, specifically to undermine the president of the United States. And the media is gleefully reporting all of them. GOSK: Who should the American public believe? Mainstream media? The federal government? Breitbart? MARLOW: Oh, I would say believe Breitbart. I think Breitbart is  \u2014   GOSK: But why? Why should we believe Breitbart over what the federal government tells us about possible connections with Russia trying to tamper with the election? MARLOW: Well, possible connections and actual connections are different. GOSK: Yes, but when you have the federal government come out and say, we are investigating Russia, potentially tampering with the election, why as an American citizen should you not step back and go, \u201cI should be worried about that\u201d? MARLOW: I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t be worried about it. But there\u2019s been ample reporting, ample investigation. The entire world has been focused on this story. And I\u2019m just asking for one piece of hard evidence. GOSK: Marlow describes his staff as a mix of both reporters and activists  \u2014   the site often blurring lines between news and opinion. What is your mission? MARLOW: First of all, is to be a great news site, covering     accurate, always accurate, information. Now, where we differ is that we\u2019re admittedly right of center. We\u2019re a populist, nationalist, grassroots conservative website. GOSK: What is Breitbart\u2019s position on immigration? MARLOW: We don\u2019t have a party line position on it. But I\u2019ll tell you a few things that are pretty consistent. We believe that border security and national security is a serious issue. And we think that there is an American value system that\u2019s worth being preserved. GOSK: Do you think that American value system is in jeopardy because of immigration? MARLOW: It depends. It\u2019s in jeopardy because of immigration if people who are coming into the country do not understand the American values and don\u2019t want to assimilate into American society. GOSK: Its brand of conservatism has come under intense fire, frequently called, among other things, racist, because of headlines like this one from two years ago. \u201cHoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage\u201d Would Breitbart print that headline today? MARLOW: I don\u2019t know the answer to that. It\u2019s a good question. But, probably yes. And to be honest with you, I disagree with the article. I don\u2019t disagree with us running it because it makes arguments that the  \u2014   that flag doesn\u2019t just symbolize racism to certain people. It symbolizes southern pride, southern heritage and states\u2019 rights. Now, my personal view is I think we\u2019ve moved on from that symbol. But, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have a debate and discussion about it. GOSK: Regardless of who it may offend. Do you compromise civility in the defense of free speech? MARLOW: In some cases that\u2019s acceptable because of the fact that it\u2019s proving a point about freedom of speech in that we used to raise a society that was supposed to be resilient emotionally. And now, everyone is looking for their safe space. And I think that\u2019s a dangerous thing. GOSK: One thing he doesn\u2019t think is dangerous  \u2014   President Trump calling the, quote, \u201cfake news media,\u201d the enemy of the American people. That kind of extreme language, is that not damaging to our democracy? MARLOW: I don\u2019t think it is because I think in a lot of ways, as Steve Bannon put it, the press is the opposition party. That\u2019s 100 percent the worldview that I have. GOSK: Breitbart made its first significant break with the White House recently over the new health care bill. One of its concerns that tax cut for the wealthy. But, it\u2019s worth pointing out, they lay the blame squarely at the feet of House Speaker Paul Ryan, not President Trump.
