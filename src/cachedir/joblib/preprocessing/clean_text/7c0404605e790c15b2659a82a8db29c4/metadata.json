S. policy to recognize to Taiwan as part of \u201cone China. \u201d A   tabloid said his grasp of foreign policy was \u201clike a child. \u201d Our reporter analyzed five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration. Mr. Trump also faces a domestic split. Prominent Republicans are calling for investigations into intelligence findings that Russian cyberattacks supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid, an assessment he has dismissed. Mr. Trump has picked  Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, for secretary of state.

The divestment movement has doubled in size in 15 months. _____ \u2022 In Syria, Aleppo is falling. The forces of President Bashar   are within days, if not hours, of capturing the last corners of the country\u2019s largest city. The seizure would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government rule in all major cities and forcing the opposition to reckon with whether the armed rebellion has failed. _____ \u2022 Jakarta\u2019s   Christian governor, known as \u201cAhok,\u201d goes on trial for blasphemy today in a case seen as a test of Indonesia\u2019s religious freedoms.

Federal Reserve Bank is probably going to increase interest rates on Wednesday. \u2022 Oil surged on promises from both OPEC and   producers to cut production, adding to to a global rout in bonds. \u2022 U. S. stocks were lower. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Christine Lagarde, the director of the International Monetary Fund, said she was \u201cprofoundly shocked\u201d by the vigorous pursuit of a criminal case against her, which alleges that her negligence as France\u2019s finance minister allowed the misuse of hundreds of millions of euros. [The New York Times] \u2022 India evacuated thousands of people and shut schools as Cyclone Vardah lashed the southern coast and the city of Chennai with heavy rain and lethal winds of up to 85 m. p. h. (140 k. p. h. ). [CNN] \u2022 The office of President Rodrigo Duterte criticized a photo essay in The Times this week that documented 57 homicides in 35 days of his antidrug campaign as \u201ctotally  \u201d and depicting the Philippines as \u201cthe Wild, Wild West. \u201d [The New York Times] \u2022 New Zealand\u2019s incoming prime minister, Bill English, provided a few surprises, including some poetry, as he laid out his vision for the country. [New Zealand Herald] \u2022 Women who lived Mosul, Iraq, under the Islamic State\u2019s   occupation described the tyranny of an extreme dress code  \u2014   even their eyes had to be covered  \u2014   enforced with a whip.

He might be surprised at the game\u2019s popularity worldwide. Especially in China, where at least 300 million people play. YMCA missionaries introduced the new game in Tianjin in 1895 and, using a Chinese translation of Naismith\u2019s rule book, spread it widely. Yao Ming lifted basketball\u2019s profile in China after becoming the top pick in the 2002 N. B. A. draft, but earlier factors helped. First, the Communist Party embraced it.
