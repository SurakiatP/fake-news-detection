S. Army veteran who was murdered in cold blood by a Palestinian terrorist last year in Israel after serving the U. S. in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Force was in Israel as part of a school mission trip, and was killed by a Palestinian terrorist who thought he was attacking Jews \u2014  even though Force was not Jewish but Christian.  \u201cTaylor Force was a serviceman and he went with his school on a mission to Israel, a seven days tour,\u201d   said in the interview, which aired Monday morning. \u201dOne of his visits in Israel was on Jaffa. It was nighttime, and a Palestinian young man came and stabbed him and many, many others with a knife. He killed him and also injured many, many others  \u2026     He did a great service to his country. He served in Iraq and served in Afghanistan. And he came to Israel on a tour in the framework of his school. \u201d Force was a    West Point graduate who served as a U. S. Army officer in Iraq and Afghanistan before enrolling in graduate school at Vanderbilt University. He was killed in a tourist area in Jaffa Port. At the time of the terrorist murder,   President Joe Biden was meeting with   President Shimon Peres in Tel Aviv when the    Palestinian terrorist went on the stabbing spree claiming Force\u2019s life and injuring many others. \u201cIt\u2019s a tourist area,\u201d   said. \u201cThe city of Jaffa is near  . It\u2019s a very hopping place at nighttime. There is a boardwalk. Very late, there is a lot of people walking by the beach. And it\u2019s the kind of a place that you do not expect to be killed or stabbed. Anywhere in Israel, it\u2019s not supposed to be dangerous a place. This is a mixed area and there are a lot of Arabs in Jaffa, but the Palestinian who stabbed Taylor Force to death was not an Israeli Arab. He came from the territories and simply decided that he\u2019s going to out tonight and stab Jews. He did not recognize that Taylor Force was not a Jew, and simply killed him with the rest of the people there. \u201d In response to the terrorist attack that claimed Force\u2019s life, members of the U. S. Congress drafted legislation in his name \u2014  the Taylor force Act \u2014  which would cut U. S. funding to the Palestinian Authority until the organization stopped paying terrorists behind attacks like this and their families. \u201cThe Taylor Force Act would take away the amount of money the Palestinians obtain,\u201d   said. \u201cThe Palestinians Authority is paying their prisoners, the secure prisoners who are sitting in the Israeli jails being sentenced for killing and for taking acts of murder and acts of terror against civilians, and also the amount of money the Palestinians are paying the families of the suicide bombers. They have been rewarding the families of those who detonate themselves and have killed the civilians. [The bill would take the money out] from the U. S. aid that the U. S. provides the Palestinian Authority. It\u2019s a total sort of deduction. They take the awards that the Palestinian Authority has given, they take it from the prisoners and families, and they take it from what the U. S. gives the Palestinians. \u201d She explained that it is \u201cshocking\u201d right now that the United States government is funding the Palestinians, who turn around and use the money to fund terrorists and their families after they commit these attacks. \u201cThis money is inducing others to go and kill, and as you can see not only Israelis are getting killed on the streets of   and Jerusalem,\u201d   said. \u201cA lot of tourists are getting killed. Israel is a popular country and gets a lot of visits from people all over the world, and Taylor Force was not the first American getting killed in   and unfortunately will not be the last one. The United States knows that part of the money they are giving to the Palestinian Authority is going to pay these prisoners and to pay the families of those who have killed their own civilians, American citizens, and as you say it\u2019s totally ironic, horrible and unbelievable that the administration keeps supporting the Palestinian Authority without demanding right now to bring to a halt right now all these payments to the prisoners and the families of suicide bombers. \u201d She added that unless the money flow from the United States is completely cut off, there is \u201cnot a chance \u2014  not a chance\u201d that the Palestinian Authority would stop using it to fund terrorists and the families of terrorists. The reason being, she said, is because it is in the \u201cculture\u201d of the Palestinians to commit these acts of horror against Israelis and the entire Western World. \u201cThey are not going to stop these payments,\u201d   said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically their culture. The culture is to promote violence against Israel. They incite people to go and kill. There is indoctrination of the people in the Palestinian Authority, areas to go and learn how to kill. The Palestinian Authority simply sees this payment as its sort of control over the Palestinian population. If they stop paying these funds, they will lose any authority. They will lose any support. They will lose the people. And the Palestinian Authority is doing basically what Hamas is doing, the terrorist organization in Gaza that controls Gaza and Gaza\u2019s government in Gaza. They give their prisoners funds. They pay stipends to their prisoners and their families who went and lost people bombing themselves. They can\u2019t really leave the market, leave the area just to Hamas, otherwise people will go and be loyal to Hamas. There is competition between the Palestinian Authority, which is headed by the PLO, and Hamas, which is a terrorist organization which controls the Gaza Strip \u2014  which complicates the situation. Therefore, talking about it, as President Trump is doing, will not get the job done. \u201d President Donald Trump, in his White House meeting with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas per White House press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s readout of the meeting, pressed Abbas on the payments to the terrorists. \u201cPresident Trump raised his concerns about payments to Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails who have committed terrorist acts, and to their families, and emphasized the need to resolve this issue,\u201d the White House readout from Spicer\u2019s office read. White House sources tell Breitbart News that Spicer was instrumental in raising this issue with President Trump ahead of that Abbas meeting, providing the president with key information about the issue of Palestinian payments to terrorist and terrorists\u2019 families. In a   meeting in Israel between Trump and Abbas during President Trump\u2019s   foreign trip, Trump was reportedly furious with Abbas after learning that Abbas apparently misled him in the Washington, D. C. White House meeting. \u201cYou tricked me in Washington,\u201d Trump reportedly said to Abbas behind closed doors in Israel, per an Israeli television station. On Monday, Abbas confidante Ahmad Majdalani told the Jerusalem Post that the reports of a heated meeting with Trump are \u201ca total fabrication and a lie. \u201d Netanyahu has also bashed Abbas for inaccurately claiming Palestinians promote peace. \u201cI heard President Abbas yesterday say that the Palestinians teach their children peace,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s not true. They name their schools after mass murderers of Israelis and they pay terrorists. \u201d   said that for President Trump to extract real action on this front and make progress toward peace, real action must happen \u2014  and that starts with the Taylor Force Act. \u201cThere must be an act to be taken,\u201d she said. \u201cThere must be more than just simple words, more than just an idea. We all know that the Palestinian Authority is paying this money. We all know, a few years ago they removed themselves from these payments asking the PLO to go make these payments, not the Palestinian Authority, so Mahmoud Abbas can come to President Trump and say, \u2018listen, it\u2019s not me. I was paying more. It\u2019s the PLO.\u2019 But let us not forget that Mahmoud Abbas is the head of the PLO in addition to his position as the head of the Palestinian Authority. So, to make a long story short, the Palestinian Authority will not halt these payments, and if President Trump is not going to take a serious step, they will just keep paying this money that induces and incites more terror attacks against civilians. \u201d She added that while there is widespread support for the Taylor Force Act in both chambers of the   U. S. congress, \u201cthere is no guarantee that it would pass. \u201d \u201cTherefore there must be a push \u2014  listeners of your radio show must call up their elected representatives and urge them to push to get this law passed,\u201d   said. \u201cThe State Department always objected to any deduction to the Palestinian Authority, to any prevention of \u2018aid\u2019 to the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians always have to get their money. The United States is always one of the largest providers of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s finances. They pay a large amount of their budget and therefore they have great leverage on the Palestinian Authority, but it\u2019s not going to get done if there won\u2019t be a public support and public urge to pass this law. So the listeners, the American citizens who care about civilian life, who care about human rights, who care about the life of Israelis and Americans in Israel have to push for this law to pass by urging their representatives to make it happen. \u201d Representatives for House Speaker Paul Ryan have not responded to requests for comment when asked why Ryan has not yet held a vote on this bill when there is clear bipartisan support for the legislation and it would easily pass the House of Representatives at this time, per Breitbart News sources on the Hill. The White House did not have a comment when asked about this bill or about the Israeli news reports on Trump\u2019s reportedly heated meeting with Abbas in Israel.
