The information is devastating to our hearts. \\nJust want you to know that man looks at the outer appearances but God looks at the heart. (1 Samuel 16:7) So He sees your grief producing a repentant heart that will lead you turn away from sin and instead go the opposite way in your life. The Bible says it this way, \u201cgodly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death.\u201d In other words, worldly grief doesn\u2019t change us, but godly grief does. Further, Scripture says, \u201cIf we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d (1 John 1:9) I don\u2019t know your situation, but I wonder if you have you personally accepted the Lord. We personally need to receive God\u2019s gracious gift of salvation knowing that Christ died in our place for our sins. The Bible says \u201cif you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says: \u2018Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.\u2019\u201d And a few verses later it says, \u201cFor everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\u201d (Romans 10:9-11, 13) \\nThe Bible tells us that it is not by our works that we are saved but by grace through faith. It\u2019s not what we do, but what God has done through his son. In Ephesians 2, Paul says, \u201c4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ \u2014 by grace you have been saved \u2014 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, so that no one may boast.\u201d And here\u2019s one more passage from Titus 3: \u201c4 But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, 5 He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\u201d \\nI hope you get to see this and that it helps. Please reply if you have any more questions.'"}, "time": 1742562983.3649938}
