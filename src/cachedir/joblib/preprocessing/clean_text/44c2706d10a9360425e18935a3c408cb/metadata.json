Two weeks to decide: Avoid it, and try to preserve the American life he has built for a little longer, even as a fugitive. Go, and lose it all: his wife and son, his job, his apartment, his world. \u201cI would feel like an animal if I stay here and hide,\u201d said Juan, 29, who asked that his last name not be used. \u201cI want to prove that I can follow the laws. I want to make my case at this meeting, but I know that if I go, they\u2019re going to deport me. \u201d In an immigration system mottled with escape hatches and hobbled by scant resources, Juan, who fled Colombia six years ago, is one of nearly a million people who have managed to linger in the United States despite having been ordered out of the country by an immigration judge  \u2014   some of them more than a decade ago. And with the Trump administration intent on sweeping perhaps millions of immigrants without legal status out of the country, the White House has not had to look far to make a quick mark. Because people with deportation orders have had their day in court, most of them can be sent out of the country without seeing a judge, sometimes within hours of being arrested. \u201cPeople who have been ordered deported and who are still here are the   fruit,\u201d said Stephen   an immigration law professor at Cornell University. \u201cTrump has said he has wanted to deport more people. The easiest way to get those numbers up are to take those people who\u2019ve been ordered deported and go after them. \u201d President Trump\u2019s immigration agency has already offered what looks like a preview: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently deported to Mexico an Arizona  mother who had been ordered out of the country four years ago. But the   will be complicated. The backlog of what the government calls \u201cfugitive aliens\u201d has persisted through Republican and Democratic administrations, inflamed conservatives who oppose illegal immigration, and resisted the immigration authorities\u2019 attempts at enforcement. Since 2006, even as the overall total of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has dipped, the number facing outstanding deportation orders has grown by more than half, to around 962, 000 people from 632, 726. More than half of them come from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. (Another 13, 200 or so, as of early February, were already in the custody of customs officials.) Despite the Bush and Obama administrations\u2019   commitments to focus on expelling those who pose a serious danger to their communities, slightly less than one in five people facing deportation has been convicted of a crime in the United States. The causes for delays can vary. Deportations have been deferred for humanitarian reasons  \u2014   like allowing mothers to stay with sick children in the United States  \u2014   or they have been frozen while an appeal is mounted. The Obama administration put off deportations for thousands of immigrants it did not consider priorities, including Juan, the Bronx electrician, and Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos, the Arizona mother, often   people with strong ties to their communities. \u201cFelons, not families criminals, not children,\u201d President Barack Obama said in 2014, describing the kinds of people he wanted deported. The government also postponed deportations for people who were likely to face torture if they were sent back. Some deportations are simply impossible to carry out: About a quarter of the immigrants with outstanding deportation orders come from countries that refuse to take back deportees, including China, Haiti, Brazil and India. Mr. Trump has threatened to stop issuing visas to people from these countries. In the past, diplomats have urged caution on this front, not wanting to disrupt international relationships over the issue of deportees. And many people under final orders have slipped through gaping cracks in the immigration system. Court notices  \u2014   either mailed to outdated addresses or illegible to Spanish speakers  \u2014   are routinely missed, leaving judges to issue deportation orders for people who miss their chance to argue their case. Nearly a quarter of judges\u2019 decisions rendered in 2015, for example, involved cases where the immigrant in question was absent. The months and, sometimes, years it takes for immigration and asylum cases to wind through a clogged court system can cause the authorities to lose track of immigrants living and working in the country, because they have fled or simply moved. The White House has sought to make it harder for immigrants to be remain free inside the United States while their requests for asylum plod through the courts. They will be detained more often, or asked to wait in Mexico until a judge can rule. \u201cThere are all kinds of things in the system that weren\u2019t built to maximize compliance,\u201d said David A. Martin, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and a former immigration official in the Obama and Clinton administrations. It led to a climate, he said, that has prompted many people to not consider a deportation order a serious matter. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the attitudes that sometimes infuriates, with some justification, people who voted for Donald Trump. \u201d In a significant break from his predecessor, Mr. Trump is directing immigration agents to go after virtually anyone who is in the United States illegally, ending the reprieve for people who had not been considered priorities. \u201cEnsure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed,\u201d one line of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration reads, with the crispness of a traffic sign. \u201cWhat has been lacking, up until a month ago, is a willingness and a commitment on the part of the administration to actually do it,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter immigration controls. \u201cNothing is easy,\u201d he said, but going after people who already have deportation orders \u201cwill be the easiest part of enforcing the president\u2019s removal priorities. \u201d President George W. Bush\u2019s administration dented the backlog by deploying fugitive teams that were supposed to track down unauthorized immigrants with deportation orders and criminal records. But the strategy drew a backlash when the raids began snaring undocumented immigrants who were not targets. \u201cThat was something that caused a lot of controversy and a lot of anxiety in immigrant communities, because it meant these officers could stop anyone at any time,\u201d said Randy Capps, the director of research at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Mr. Capps added that while the Obama administration narrowed the scope of such raids, he expected the Trump administration to return to the Bush model. There is, of course, an easier way to find some people with final orders: Wait for them to walk into ICE offices for their scheduled appointments. Ms. Rayos was driven across the border within hours of her   in Phoenix, and her deportation has haunted immigrants with coming appointments ever since. But the Trump administration has yet to show a consistent hand. Roxana Orellana Santos, 37, was allowed to walk out of her appointment in Baltimore last week. Ms. Santos, who said she had fled domestic abuse in El Salvador, was arrested in 2008 while eating lunch outdoors, her lawyers say, leading to a civil rights lawsuit that claimed she had been racially profiled. She had been ordered deported two years before that arrest, after she missed an immigration court hearing. Her lawyers said she could not read the notice, which was in English. Ms. Santos\u2019s next appointment is in August. \u201cI don\u2019t feel assured of what the outcome\u2019s going to be next time,\u201d she said, adding that she had asked her brother to help her husband care for her four children if she was deported. In the case of Juan, the electrician, nothing remains to stop the government from acting on the deportation order he first received in 2013. Juan had requested asylum after paramilitary forces in Colombia tried to kill him, he said, but he lost his final appeal the month Mr. Trump was elected president. \u201cI feel hopeless,\u201d Juan said. \u201cMy wife is here, my son is here, they are my world. I have nowhere else to run to. I\u2019ve run out of options. I don\u2019t know what to do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561633.630643}
