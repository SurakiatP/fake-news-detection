Trump said, \u201cWe are going to keep our country safe. We are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we will be very successful with. It shouldn\u2019t have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason, one of the reasons I\u2019m standing here today, the security of our country, the voters felt that I would give it the best security. So we\u2019ll be doing something very rapidly, having to do with additional security for our country. You\u2019ll be seeing that sometime next week. In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately I have no doubt that we\u2019ll win that particular case. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564049.219438}
