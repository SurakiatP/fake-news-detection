But her performance has not been enough to appease some observers on the internet. Douglas, 20, who won the women\u2019s   during the London Olympics in 2012, lamented on Sunday that she had been picked apart by people on social media for everything from her appearance  \u2014   right down to her hair texture  \u2014   to her behavior during a medal ceremony while the national anthem was being played. \u201cWhen they talk about my hair or not putting my hand over my heart or being very salty in the stands, really criticizing me, for me it was really hurtful,\u201d Douglas, who is   said, according to The Associated Press. Even her mother, Natalie Hawkins, expressed frustration with the harsh attacks. \u201cThey said she had breast enhancements they said she wasn\u2019t smiling enough, she\u2019s unpatriotic,\u201d Hawkins told Reuters. After some observers noticed that Douglas looked disappointed while watching her teammates succeed, \u201cit went to not supporting your teammates,\u201d her mother said. Hawkins added: \u201cNow you\u2019re \u2018Crabby Gabby.\u2019 You name it, and she got trampled. What did she ever do to anyone?\u201d The Olympics have always been fertile ground for cutthroat competition and narratives about fallen heroes, but observers on social media can distort those stories and take them to extremes  \u2014   while still expecting athletes to smile and act gracefully when they lose. In the pool, Lilly King of the United States made a point to emphasize her   win over Yulia Efimova of Russia, who had served a doping suspension and was booed every time she entered the Olympic Aquatics Stadium. And there has been no shortage of scrutiny of the    swimmer Missy Franklin, who won four gold medals in London only to fall short in Rio, prompting a slew of \u201cWhat happened?\u201d headlines. But the online criticism of Douglas has been relentless since her lackluster performance during the Olympic trials, she and her mother both said. After the United States women\u2019s team took home the gold last Tuesday, Douglas\u2019s failure to put her hand on her heart during the national anthem struck a nerve with viewers. Not everyone thought this was valid criticism. It is not as if Douglas has not been hard on herself, criticizing her   performance in the uneven bars. \u201cIn my head, I pictured it a little bit differently,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to picture yourself being on top and doing amazing gymnastics. \u201d Athletes have never been as accessible as they are right now  \u2014   especially those like Douglas and Franklin who rely on social media to build a fan base and share sponsored posts from brands they endorse, like United Airlines and Gillette razors. That accessibility becomes a   sword when they do not perform as well as they should, or if fans catch a whiff of jealousy, bad behavior or team infighting. But if we have learned anything from social media\u2019s power to tear down idols, it is that the same tools can be used to build someone back up. By Monday, #LOVE4GABBYUSA was being spread across Twitter by fans who wanted to help Douglas feel better despite the onslaught of abuse. It was an outpouring of support for an athlete that came days, if not years, too late.'"}, "time": 1742562289.4188068}
