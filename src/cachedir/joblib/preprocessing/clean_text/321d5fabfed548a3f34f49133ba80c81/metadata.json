Then came grim rumors and angry complaints from parents that the government had kept them in the dark about the risks since last year. Now, the country\u2019s immunization program faces a backlash of public distrust that critics say has been magnified by the government\u2019s ingrained secrecy. Song Zhendong, like many parents here, said he was reluctant to risk further vaccinations for his    son. \u201cIf he can avoid them in the future, we will not get them,\u201d said Mr. Song, a businessman. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we learn about this sooner? If there\u2019s a problem with vaccines for our kids, we should be told as soon as the police knew. Aren\u2019t our children the future of the nation?\u201d The faulty vaccines have become the latest lightning rod for widespread, often visceral distrust of China\u2019s medical system, and a rebuff to what many Chinese critics see as President Xi Jinping\u2019s bulldozing,   rule. The scandal is just the latest crisis to shake public faith in China\u2019s food and medicine supplies, but it is the first big scare under Mr. Xi, who had vowed to be different. He came into office promising to \u201cmake protecting the people\u2019s right to health a priority. \u201d \u201cIf our party can\u2019t even handle food safety properly while governing China, and this keeps up, some will wonder whether we\u2019re up to the job,\u201d Mr. Xi said in 2013, the year he became president. The anger here in Heze, the city in the eastern province of Shandong where the scandal has its roots, is evident. About two million improperly stored vaccines were sold around the country from an overheated, dilapidated storeroom. The main suspect in the case is a hospital pharmacist from Heze who had been convicted of trading in illegal vaccines in 2009 and was doing it again two years later. Many parents said they were especially alarmed that nearly a year had elapsed from the time the police uncovered the illicit trade and the time the public first learned about it in February. \u201cWithholding information doesn\u2019t maintain public credibility,\u201d said Li Shuqing, a lawyer in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, who is one of about 90 attorneys who have volunteered to represent possible victims in the case. \u201cIn the end, it makes people more distrustful. \u201d To many here, the combination of lax regulation and the secrecy surrounding a potential public health crisis seems like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In the SARS crisis of 2003, 349 people died across mainland China and hundreds more died elsewhere after officials hid the extent of its spread. In a scandal that came to light in 2008, at least six children died and 300, 000 fell ill with kidney stones and other problems from infant formula adulterated with melamine, an industrial chemical. \u201cThe customers worry about fake milk powder, fake medicine, fake vaccines, fake everything,\u201d said Ma Guohui, the owner of a shop on the rural fringe of Heze that sells baby products. \u201cThis is certainly going to affect people\u2019s thinking. My boy got all his vaccination shots. If he were born now, I\u2019d worry. \u201d Despite such fears, the tainted vaccines are more likely to be ineffective than harmful. The World Health Organization has said that outdated or poorly stored vaccines rarely if ever trigger illness or toxic reactions. Chinese government investigators said last week that they had not found any cases of adverse reactions or spikes in infections linked to ineffective vaccines. The greater danger may be more insidious. The erosion of public trust could damage China\u2019s immunization program, which has been credited with significant declines in measles and other communicable diseases. \u201cConfidence is easy to shake, and that\u2019s happened across the world and has happened here,\u201d said Lance Rodewald, a doctor with the World Health Organization\u2019s immunization program in Beijing. \u201cWe hear through social media that parents are worried, and we know that when they\u2019re worried, there\u2019s a very good chance that they may think it\u2019s safer not to vaccinate than to vaccinate. That\u2019s when trouble can start. \u201d After unfounded reports of deaths caused by a hepatitis B vaccine in 2013, such vaccinations across 10 provinces fell by 30 percent in the days afterward, and the administration of other mandatory vaccines fell by 15 percent, according to Chinese health officials. The illicit vaccines in the current case were not part of China\u2019s compulsory,   vaccination program, which inoculates children against illnesses such as polio and measles at no charge. The illegal trade dealt in     vaccines  \u2014   including those for rabies, influenza and hepatitis B  \u2014   which patients pay for from their own pockets. The pharmacist named in the investigation, Pang Hongwei, bought cheap vaccines from drug companies and traders  \u2014   apparently batches close to their expiration dates  \u2014   and sold them in 23 provinces and cities, according to drug safety investigators. She began the business in 2011, just two years after she had been convicted on charges of illegally trading in vaccines and sentenced to three years in prison, which was reduced to five years\u2019 probation. Officials have not explained how she was able to avoid prison and resume her business. Ms. Pang, in her late 40s, and her daughter, who has been identified only by her surname, Sun, kept the vaccines in a rented storeroom of a disused factory in Jinan. The storeroom lacked refrigeration, which may have damaged the vaccines\u2019 potency. The police have detained them but not announced specific charges, and neither suspect has had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations. Lax regulation in the   commercial system allowed Ms. Pang\u2019s business to grow, several medical experts said. Local government medical agencies and clinics were able to increase their profits by turning to cheap, illegal suppliers, People\u2019s Daily, the official party paper, reported on Tuesday. Police investigators discovered Ms. Pang\u2019s storehouse last April, but word did not get out to the public until a Shandong news website reported on the case in February of this year. Most Chinese had still heard nothing about it until another website, The Paper, published a report that drew national attention a month later. It was the government\u2019s intolerance of public criticism, critics said, that kept the scandal under wraps, a delay that now makes it harder to track those who received the suspect injections. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen with these problem vaccines that without the right to know, without press freedom, the public\u2019s right to health can\u2019t be assured,\u201d said Wang Shengsheng, one of the lawyers pressing the government for more answers and redress over the case. In the last few weeks, official reticence has been supplanted by daily announcements of arrests, checks and assurances as the central government has scrambled to dampen public anger and alarm. Premier Li Keqiang ordered central ministries and agencies in March to investigate what had gone wrong. Last week, the investigators reported that 202 people had been detained over the scandal, and 357 officials dismissed, demoted or otherwise punished. Health and drug officials promised to tighten vaccine purchase rules to stamp out    trade. \u201cHow could this trafficking in vaccines outside the rules spread to so many places and go on for so long?\u201d Mr. Li said, according to an official account. Without decisive action, he said, \u201cordinary people will vote with their feet and go and buy the products they trust. \u201d Mr. Xi has so far not publicly commented on the scandal. Dr. Rodewald, the World Health Organization expert, said the proposed changes were promising and would mean clinics would not have to rely on selling   vaccines for their upkeep. Xu Huijin, a doctor in Heze, said that the concern over the scandal  \u2014   and unfounded rumors of deaths  \u2014   had depressed the number of parents bringing children to her clinic for inoculations. \u201cThis was badly handled,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lack of coordination, not enough information. We should have found out about this long ago. Doctors are taught to tell patients the full facts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564260.5631328}
