The position of student body president was awarded to the   finisher, Bobby Brooks, a junior who became Texas AM\u2019s first openly gay student body president.  McIntosh was initially disqualified over claims that he may have engaged in voter intimidation tactics. The concern was quickly dismissed by Texas AM\u2019s Judicial Court, which The Washington Post calls \u201cthe university\u2019s version of a student supreme court. \u201d But McIntosh\u2019s disqualification was upheld, with the reason given that he \u201cfailed to disclose financial information for glow sticks briefly featured in a campaign video. \u201d Secretary of Energy and former Governor of Texas Rick Perry, who is an alumnus of Texas AM, wrote a column for The Houston Chronicle citing his concerns over the decision to take the position away from McIntosh over the purchase of glow sticks that appeared in his campaign video. \u201cAs Texas\u2019 first Aggie governor and as someone who was twice elected Yell Leader of Texas AM University, I am deeply troubled by the recent conduct of AM\u2019s administration and Student Government Association (SGA) during the Aggie   president elections for \u201d he began. Mainstream media outlets like The Washington Post were quick to question the motivations behind Secretary Perry\u2019s criticisms, running the headline \u201cRick Perry accuses Texas AM\u2019s first gay student body president of stealing election\u201d on their Facebook page. \u201dI viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character\u201d  \u2014   Rick Perry on election of gay student. Does this headline suggest that? pic. twitter.   \u2014   Tommy (@tciccotta) March 23, 2017,  Perry argued that the student body\u2019s support of Brooks as an openly gay student was a \u201ctestament to the Aggie character. \u201d \u201cWhen I first read that our student body had elected an openly gay man, Bobby Brooks, for president of the student body, I viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character. I was proud of our students because the election appeared to demonstrate a commitment to treating every student equally, judging on character rather than on personal characteristics,\u201d he wrote. Despite The Washington Post\u2018s suggestion, Perry\u2019s criticism wasn\u2019t pointed at Brooks it was pointed at the administrators responsible for disqualifying McIntosh on a technicality. \u201cIn its opinion, the Judicial Court admitted that the charges were minor and technical, but, incredibly, chose to uphold the disqualification, with no consideration given to whether the punishment fit the crime. The desire of the electorate is overturned, and thousands of student votes are disqualified because of free glow sticks that appeared for 11 seconds of a   campaign. Apparently, glow sticks merit the same punishment as voter intimidation,\u201d he argued. Perry claimed that McIntosh received the glow sticks for participating in a charity event before the campaign and also that the other candidates weren\u2019t asked to itemize the expenses of props used in their campaign videos. \u201cNow, Brooks\u2019 presidency is being treated as a victory for \u2018diversity.\u2019 It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for \u2018diversity\u2019 is the real reason the election outcome was overturned,\u201d Perry argued. \u201cDoes the principle of \u2018diversity\u2019 override and supersede all other values of our Aggie Honor Code? \u201cHonestly, we were just surprised to see that the secretary of energy would take the time to weigh in in detail,\u201d Amy Smith, the school\u2019s senior vice president of marketing and communications, told the Texas Tribune, \u201cand we respectfully disagree with his assessment of what happened. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.
