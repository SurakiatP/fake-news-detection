But no matter: For many of the thousands gathering at the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday afternoon for the preinaugural concert, the artists in the lineup were secondary to the chance to celebrate the coming presidency of Donald J. Trump. The day\u2019s programming was heavy on country music, \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d and a hefty number of bagpipes. Two friends, Kim Shourds and Susan Perkins Lovelady, drove in from Norfolk, Va. to attend the evening\u2019s concerts. They danced and sang along to \u201cGod Blessed Texas,\u201d but as they took a break, they said the volatile political climate wasn\u2019t far from their minds. \u201cThis is a celebration of America,\u201d Ms. Perkins Lovelady, 53, said. \u201cAfter all of the negativity of the past year, all of the positivity is a good thing. It\u2019s a heartsore country. \u201d Kenny and Katherine Dunham decided to make the   drive from Kinston, N. C. after hearing that Representative John Lewis of Georgia would boycott Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. The Dunhams were not fazed by the lack of   entertainers. \u201cI think if they don\u2019t want to perform, they shouldn\u2019t perform,\u201d Mr. Dunham, 60, said. \u201cBut at the same time, my understanding is they weren\u2019t asked to. Toby Keith is going to perform. Lee Greenwood is going to perform. \u201d Some of the loudest cheers of the evening were for Jon Voight, the only   Hollywood actor to lend his name to the event, as he spoke to the crowd about the \u201cbarrage of propaganda\u201d that Mr. Trump had faced in his race to the presidency. \u201cHe certainly didn\u2019t need this job,\u201d Mr. Voight said of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd yes, God answered all of our prayers. \u201d Mr. Voight then introduced Sam Moore, one half of the duo Sam  Dave, who performed a soulful rendition of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful. \u201d Mr. Trump made his first appearance about an hour into the show  \u2014   called the \u201cMake America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\u201d  \u2014   when he walked down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with his wife, Melania. He turned and saluted Lincoln\u2019s statue, then descended the steps with a small wave and gave his supporters a thumbs up. Mr. Trump and his family watched the performance of the Frontmen of Country, a group featuring three lead singers: Richie McDonald of Lonestar, Larry Stewart of Restless Heart, and Tim Rushlow, formerly of Little Texas. They played a medley that included a cover of Marc Cohn\u2019s \u201cWalking In Memphis\u201d and Lonestar\u2019s hit \u201cI\u2019m Already There. \u201d Mr. Greenwood then joined for a performance of \u201cGod Bless the U. S. A. \u201d  \u2014   Mr. Trump\u2019s   song during the campaign. The   could be seen mouthing the words of the song on the side of the stage, to the delight of the crowd. After the performance, Mr. Trump pumped his fist, and embraced the musicians as they walked off stage. The audience was subdued for 3 Doors Down, an alternative rock band that hasn\u2019t made the Billboard Top 10 chart since 2003, and the Piano Guys, a group featuring a cellist and pianist that is known for its eclectic covers of pop songs. However, it was Mr. Keith, the country star and the night\u2019s biggest draw, who brought the National Mall roaring back to life. There has never been a president crossing over so directly from the   world as Mr. Trump, who remains an executive producer of \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d and has cultivated big names in Hollywood for decades (even making a \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d cameo). Yet those big names are shunning his inauguration, including Thursday\u2019s event, unlike the Lincoln Memorial concert in 2009 for President Obama that featured Beyonc\u00e9 and other stars. The artists who are showing up are reflective of the   of the United States that buoyed Mr. Trump to victory in November, while belying the opulence he is known for. Standing by the memorial\u2019s reflecting pool a few hours before the show, John Stephan, a    retired banker, said he left California on Tuesday to be part of the festivities and snagged a ticket to the concert at the last minute. As for the various entertainers who had snubbed the concert  \u2014   or even said yes and then backpedaled  \u2014   Mr. Stephan was dismissive. \u201cI think it\u2019s sad when anybody says, you know, \u2018My opinion of a person\u2019s more important than let\u2019s just get the country going,\u2019\u201d he said. Lines to get into the show began forming in the morning. About 5, 000 tickets were available, and the crowd steadily filled the empty spots near the memorial and on the mall by the start of the show. Along the streets leading to the memorial, people pulled wagons full of homemade Trump merchandise, including Make America Great Again hats and Trump scarves. Rick Storm traveled in from Philadelphia with a backpack full of $10   to sell. By 1 p. m. he had sold only one  . \u201cI just started,\u201d Mr. Storm said. Sitting on the ground near the reflecting pool, Tom Boatman and his wife, Kathy, were resting and waiting for headliners to start. They had driven from Cookeville, Tenn. to attend the inauguration. The couple said they were both looking forward to the concerts, but the big priority for them was to see Mr. Trump take office. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over this time tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Boatman, who works as a plant operations manager, said of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him, but I had hope. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, as some of his supporters see it, was never about fitting in with the Hollywood crowd. Thursday\u2019s lineup suited them just fine. Truth be told, they didn\u2019t want Beyonc\u00e9 anyway. They wanted Mr. Trump, who was expected to speak at the concert. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the highlight,\u201d Mr. Stephan said. At the closing of the show, Mr. Trump gave the crowd what it wanted. \u201cYou\u2019re not forgotten anymore,\u201d he said as part of his brief remarks. With that, a massive fireworks display started over the Lincoln Memorial, including one firework that formed the letters \u201cU. S. A. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563318.7359102}
