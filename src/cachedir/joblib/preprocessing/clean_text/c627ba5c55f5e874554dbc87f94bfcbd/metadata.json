Under Secretary Kelly, the DHS is poised to change some of the   conditions illegal immigrants, including criminals, receive while in detention.  As an example, illegal immigrants in two Orange County, California, detention facilities have daily clothing and bedding changes performed by a jail employee. The standard for other criminal facilities is a weekly change. \u201cThat one seems a little overkill,\u201d detaining center Commander Jon J. Briggs told the New York Times. \u201cJail is jail,\u201d Butler County, Ohio, Sheriff Richard Jones told the New York newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s fair and it\u2019s human, but we don\u2019t put chocolates on the pillows. \u201d Landy reacted to the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to toughen standards in the detention centers and claimed, \u201ca decision to simultaneously abandon detention standards could have disastrous consequences for the health and safety of these individuals. \u201d He said he hoped Secretary Kelly, \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to dismantle the progress we had made,\u201d but didn\u2019t really detail what \u201cprogress\u201d he was referencing. The New York Times detailed some of the \u201cprogress\u201d he might have been referencing. The ever growing list of requirements call for: Notify immigration officials if a detainee spends two weeks or longer in solitary confinement. Check on suicidal inmates every 15 minutes, and evaluate their mental health every day. Inform detainees, in languages they can understand, how to obtain medical care. In disciplinary hearings, provide a staff member who can advocate in English on the detainee\u2019s behalf. ICE officials declined to comment on Landy\u2019s claims, stating only that the agency responsible for enforcing immigration law is \u201cin the midst of examining a variety of detention models to determine which models would best meet anticipated detention needs. \u201d The Clinton Administration established the initial standards in 2000. Since that time, they expanded under President George W. Bush in 2008 and again under President Obama in 2011. The current guidelines now fill 455 pages and go into \u201cgranular detail on subjects including the minimum number of toilets  \u2014   one for every 12 detainees in male facilities or eight detainees in female facilities  \u2014   and trash bag thickness (at least 1. 5 millimeters),\u201d the New York Times reported. With the crackdown on criminal aliens and other deportable individuals under the Trump Administration, more detention facilities will be required and costs will be an increasing concern. Commander Briggs told the reporter from the New York Times the Trump Administration has already requested 500 additional beds. They warned that more will be coming in the months ahead. The commander said he currently can take only 120 at this time. Breitbart Texas Managing Director and    Brandon Darby contributed to this article.
