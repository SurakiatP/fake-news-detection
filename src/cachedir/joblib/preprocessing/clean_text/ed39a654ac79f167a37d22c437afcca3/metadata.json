Trump made provocative remarks on Wednesday about Russian intelligence services and Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, readers of The New York Times responded with a record number of comments. More than 9, 220 comments on the article were approved by moderators, who review nearly every one before they are published on The Times\u2019s digital platforms. Thousands more comments were posted on The Times\u2019s Facebook page. The article became the   on in The Times\u2019s history. At his news conference, Mr. Trump said he hoped Russian intelligence services had hacked Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they might have stolen, essentially urging them to commit cyberespionage. Here are excerpts from the comments, some of which have been lightly edited for clarity. Some readers said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments showed he lacked   and signaled that he could not be trusted to keep the nation\u2019s secrets safe. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t seem to have a grasp on what comes out of his mouth. In his attempts to look strong, and always be talking over others, he seems to be totally unable to control his outbursts and totally ridiculous statements. \u201d  \u2014   Julius in New York. \u201cThe man\u2019s lack of impulse control regarding what comes out of his mouth is the most worrisome aspect of his potential presidency. Regardless of what you believe about Hillary, is this the spokesperson in chief you want for our nation?\u201d  \u2014   GMS in Chicago. \u201cJust imagine, for even a brief second, what he might say when he is president. Who he might talk to on the \u2018red phone.\u2019 Remember, when he talks he says what HE thinks is right, not what the world believes. \u201d  \u2014   D. C. Researcher in Washington. Some readers said Mr. Trump was committing an act of patriotism by seeking to expose Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email and were skeptical that he intended harm with his remarks. \u201cI hate to say it, but if it was Russia, thank goodness that someone had the urge to expose another crooked and rigged system. If you will recall, Trump has said all along that the DNC and Clinton rigged the primaries   \u2026     and he was right. \u201d  \u2014   Florida Len in Florida. \u201cIf you listen to the whole quote it was obviously   cheek, not   . He was making a joke about Hillary deleting all of those emails. \u201d  \u2014   Gary Taustine in New York. \u201cI was astounded when commentators took Trump\u2019s statement at literal face value. Let\u2019s hope no one ever tells one of these people to go jump off a bridge. \u201d  \u2014   Jim in New York. \u201cMaybe the American people deserve to see them. She had them open for the [taking]. \u201d  \u2014   Gary James Richards of Oak Ridge, N. J. on The Times\u2019s Facebook page. Several commenters accused Mr. Trump of sedition or treason and demanded that he be punished.  \u201cThat Donald Trump would encourage a tyrant like Vladimir Putin and his surrogates to meddle in our affairs is treason of the highest order. The fact that he would encourage our adversary for his own political gain shows he would stop at nothing to get what he wants. He doesn\u2019t care about anyone or anything other than himself. I wouldn\u2019t ever count on a turncoat traitor like Donald Trump to have my back under any circumstances. \u201d  \u2014   JG in Old North Bridge, Mass. \u201cTo call on a foreign government to engage in espionage against your political opponent that is a former member of the government is sedition and the stuff of banana republics. \u201d  \u2014   Erik in Boise, Idaho. Some readers suggested Mr. Trump was angling for the spotlight during  the Democratic National Convention.  \u201cTrump just can\u2019t stomach the fact that he is not front and center in the media this week, so he has to come up with something to divert the media\u2019s attention to him. Pitiful excuse for a human, let alone a presidential candidate. \u201d  \u2014   Lib in Utah. \u201cThis is just Trump\u2019s latest stunt to take the news cycle away from the D. N. C. Stop wasting time parsing the meaning of this nonsense!\u201d  \u2014   Doctor Jay in New York. Some readers compared Mrs. Clinton\u2019s  fitness to lead the country in the wake of her  email scandal with Mr. Trump\u2019s  request for Russia to produce the emails. Other readers said that equivalence was false.  \u201cIf President Trump saw his approval ratings fall, he might well conspire with Putin to do something nefarious to raise his ratings, even if it meant selling the secrets or the principles of his country. Yes, Hillary is sometimes not completely trustworthy, but Trump has taken untrustworthiness to a new level. \u201d  \u2014   John in Chevy Chase. Md. \u201cThe chief complaint about Hillary Clinton is that she seems inauthentic because she is overly cautious and measures her responses. Well, here\u2019s a perfect example of the opposite of that. Is this who we want in charge? This should be taken very seriously. \u201d  \u2014   MDNewell in Midlothian, Va.'"}, "time": 1742563183.9578564}
