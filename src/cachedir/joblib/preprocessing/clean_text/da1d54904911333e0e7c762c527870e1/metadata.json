Studies have found they are MORE racist than whites and I know why, mainly due to the \u201cChip That Is ON Their Shoulder\u201d\u2026discussed later. \\nRacism and stereotyping exist not only because of the obvious, like ones experiences and their encounters with certain individual types, but also what one has been taught, (right or wrong) or better yet, both experience and what they have taught matches, so how can one NOT come to a solid conclusion? At this point their views are pretty much sealed. Kind of like getting \u201cSAVED\u201d it isn\u2019t enough to know in your head something is true about JESUS and His word, but once the heart agrees, then it\u2019s pretty much sealed. Why are BLACKS (sorry not into being politically correct, no one is calling me an \u201cEUROPEAN AMERICAN\u201d\u2026and REAL Africans hate the comparison\u2026lol, google it) the ONLY ones who CRY RACISM at every turn, at every perceived injustice, at every corrective criticism, at every comment made, at not taking accountability for their actions, etc?\u2026.The main reason is\u2026. \\nTHE VICTIM MENTALITY: Want to read a great book on the subject, Ken Hamblin\u2019s \u201cPick A Better Country\u201d and \u201cPlain Talk And Common Sense\u201d\u2026I have them both and I use to listen to him when he was on the air and he is right ,and he is as \u201cblack\u201d as they get, (color wise) and he is from Harlem. So I trust his and Bill Cosby\u2019s (although, he has tarnished his name now) take on the \u201cVICTIM MENTALITY\u201d. All one has to do is look around them and see it is true. \\nAs you can see, my focus will be on RACISM against \u201cPeople Of Color\u201d not against whites, because that is the consensus going around and what I have experienced and others I know have experienced. And before anyone tries to call me a RACIST, I am not! I judge people individually, till you prove the stereotype right, then that only makes me MORE cautious of the next person who comes along. And so far in my 51 yrs of EXPERIENCE, I have learned that \u201cSTEREOTYPES EXIST FOR A REASON\u201d. But, like everyone else who has their flaws, such as any white insecure jealous woman, or any man trying to get into my pants, or anyone who exhibits \u201cUnsafe\u201d or \u201cUnhealthy\u201d attributes, I will still give another person, no matter what their race is, the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d, although I will say, some more than others. I\u2019m not stupid, or ignorant, it\u2019s called being WISE. It is one thing to respect others and be cordial, it is another to just let anyone into your life, or do business with them. Trust is earned not freely given. . Going back to the \u201cVICTIM MENTALITY\u201d, this is what is HOLDING THE BLACK COMMUNITY DOWN and is why stereotypes and racism exist. Saying it doesn\u2019t, or trying to TWIST or SPIN into existence something that just isn\u2019t true, will not FLY with most who have even half a brain. Common Sense and ones Experience will always trump \u201cPOLITICAL CORRECTNESS\u201d. The media doesn\u2019t want you to know the truth as they OMIT or SPIN things, but they can only do so much, because of all the REALITY SHOWS. (uncensored behavior and mentality) and NEWS PIECES that portray a better reality. Sad thing is too many just won\u2019t say anything, they just talk in private about the subject among those liked minded out of FEAR! But truth is truth, so here goes. \\nDoes anyone else find it interesting that throughout history, many different races, if not all have been slaves, ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery ) yet ONLY BLACKS are left with a \u201cVICTIM MENTALITY?\u201d\u2026don\u2019t get me wrong, what was done to them and any slave at the time or in the past and even now (Are we focused on the 200,000 sex trafficked in Sacramento alone???\u2026of course not!!!) was wrong. I would have to say that the MISTREATMENT and abuse of another is wrong, but slavery was a way of life even going back to the biblical times. When you think about it, we are ALL SLAVES to something. Slavery and bondage are a way of life even when it comes to ourselves. Some are in BONDAGE to their desires and indulgent behaviors, to their insecurities, to their relationships, to their job, to their boss, to their parents, to their children etc. The only \u201cFREE SLAVE\u201d\u2026is one who is a bond servant to Christ and who has follow His Lordship in their life. OK, no rabbit trails, I\u2019ll leave it at that. \\nPoint is SLAVERY is not as dirty of a word as many would like to think\u2026.Like many things in our lives, it isn\u2019t what happens to us that matters, but what we DO with it\u2026.sad to say, most, but not all blacks throughout history have chosen to take the NEGATIVE REACTION for their \u201clot in life\u201d\u2026The \u201cBlame Game\u201d is so unbecoming\u2026 and senseless. I don\u2019t care who you are, if one cannot take ACCOUNTABILITY individually for their own actions, in spite of their surroundings and circumstances, then one will naturally FALL PREY to the negativity that comes with that choice. One of my 5 Factors, is 1) ONES OWN SIN. (starts here) John Mcwhorter and Ken Hamblin adequately and articulately explains all the ends and outs of a VICTIM MENTALITY among the black community, way better than I can. All I know is, no other race that has been slaves throughout history has played the \u201cRACE CARD\u201d nor have they proclaimed themselves as \u201cVICTIMS\u201d\u2026none. If anything they OVERCAME and CONTRIBUTED! They banded together (did not destroy each other, black on black crime is extremely high, 90%) and supported each other, financially and in many other ways, to say \u201cWE ARE A PROUD PEOPLE, WE CAN DO THIS\u201d \\nMore food for thought. I have often wondered, have any of those who feel such an outrage against how the blacks were treated while enslaved (all nationalities throughout history endured the same, blacks are no different) ever thought about what I am about to say? Like I said, we all have choices to go POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in any given situation and to me I would think the black community would be able to \u201cmove on\u201d\u2026.be THANKFUL for being brought to AMERICA for their future generations after slavery. Look what they were SAVED FROM. (For one America gave them CHRISTIANITY/SALVATION!) \\nWho possesses more slaves today than any other group\u2026AFRICA! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa so why is it OK, that blacks can enslave blacks, but no other group can? Why is it that blacks can call themselves degrading names, yet no one else can? Why can they kill whites and not be called racist, but if a black is killed by a white automatically they are racist? Why the double standards?\u2026Do they really want to go back to\u2026. \\nGENOCIDE, SLAVERY, RAPE an epidemic of AIDS etc. And black women, do you really want to be dominated by a man and treated as property and have your cliterious cut off as a child (without any anesthetic) and live the life of an average African woman\u2026.. very hard work, no pleasure, no value, life of servant hood (slavery) always in fear? \\nSeriously, what are these\u201dVictim Mentality Type\u201d people fighting for? Do they want to go back to Africa? Of course not, they claim they want to be treated EQUALLY\u2026Well, that sounds fair to me, THEN ACT LIKE IT! \\nSTOP fitting the \u201cstereotype\u201d, be the one who says, I don\u2019t care what others think of me, if being an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d or a \u201cSell Out\u201d is what it takes to be \u201cEqual\u201d then so be it. I will not play victim, I will \u201cTake The Bull By The Horn\u201d be accountable for my behavior and do what it takes legally, ethically, morally and responsibly to \u201cFIT IN!\u201d and if more and more people did that then stereotypes would change. \\nI could write more on the subject, but feel this is a good place to stop.'"}, "time": 1742561727.3107831}
