In fact, Trump has overtaken Obama\u2019s popularity that year by a whopping 25%. \\nRai\u2019s MogIA system has only gotten smarter since it was launched, and even correctly predicted the results of this year\u2019s Republican and Democratic primaries. \\nSHARE this report if you are ready for Donald Trump to be the President of the United States!'"}, "time": 1742563367.7524676}
