N. is extremely concerned that the consequences will be dire for millions of civilians if the electricity and water networks are not immediately repaired,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cThe U. N. stands ready to assist the civilian population of Aleppo, a city now united in its suffering,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt a minimum, the U. N. requires a     or weekly   humanitarian pauses to reach the millions of people in need throughout Aleppo and replenish the food and medicine stocks, which are running dangerously low. \u201d The statement also denounced the military targeting of hospitals and clinics, which it said \u201ccontinues unabated, seriously jeopardizing the health and welfare of all citizens of Aleppo. \u201d The fighting in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city before the civil war that began more than five years ago, escalated sharply over the weekend, when rebel forces and their jihadist allies challenged the government\u2019s siege of   districts. They severed the primary government supply route to Aleppo, effectively isolating the entire city. Roughly 275, 000 people in   eastern Aleppo have been under siege by Syrian forces and their Russian military partners since July. The rebel advance put civilians in   western Aleppo at risk, increasing the total population under threat to about two million. The crisis worsened as the United Nations Security Council was briefed privately on Tuesday by the special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, and the top humanitarian aid official, Stephen O\u2019Brien. Mr. de Mistura, who has been seeking to restart peace talks, did not speak publicly afterward, but diplomats later told reporters that he did not foresee a resumption of talks in August. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want any preconditions to exist, he wants to be able to control the process, he wants to decide about the timing,\u201d said Alexis Lamek, France\u2019s deputy ambassador. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we can have meaningful talks if there is not the minimal conducive environment for that. \u201d Samantha Power, the United States ambassador, was also pessimistic: \u201cWe\u2019re in reverse gear\u201d on the issues of humanitarian access and a cessation of hostilities in the conflict, she said, the two conditions for peace talks to resume. \u201cSo we\u2019ve always understood that these were three legs on a stool, and in order for the stool to be upright, all of the legs have to be stable,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd from what we heard, we\u2019re a long way from that. \u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien, who spoke outside the council\u2019s chambers after his appearance, said he had told council diplomats of \u201cthe horrific humanitarian situation in Aleppo, where fighting rages and two million people live in fear of besiegement. \u201d He said children were especially vulnerable from the water crisis and that wells drilled in the city were \u201cnot nearly enough to sustain the population. \u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien also said there had been no emergency deliveries to Aleppo this month, despite a previously negotiated agreement for humanitarian access. \u201cThis was not in line with the plan,\u201d he said. Aid delivery teams for the United Nations were \u201cready to roll\u201d if a humanitarian pause could be enforced, Mr. O\u2019Brien said, but for now it was too dangerous \u201ceven for the very brave people on the ground  \u2014   they are brave, but they are not suicidal. \u201d Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Syria and millions displaced since the conflict began in March 2011 as a peaceful opposition movement against President Bashar  . The Syrian Center for Policy Research, a   group, estimated earlier this year that the death toll was at least 470, 000. '"}, "time": 1742562101.8462129}
