I guess some Jew\u2019s prayer remains unanswered tonight. \\nWhile there was the makings of a tragedy, the heavens themselves have intervened to keep the Glorious Leader\u2019s lieutenant safe and sound. \\nWhile there is currently any evidence that this accident was caused by human malfeasance, I\u2019ll just go ahead and assume this was conjured by the Kabbalistic magic of vengeful Rabbis trying to thwart the God-Emperor\u2019s rise to power. \\nABC news : \\nA charter aircraft carrying Donald Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence slid off the runway Thursday night while landing at LaGuardia Airport in the New York City borough of Queens, prompting a temporary closure of the entire airport. \\nAbout an hour and a half after the incident, one of LaGuardia\u2019s two runways has reopened for arriving and departing flights. The FAA said the airport\u2019s other runway will remain closed indefinitely pending clearing of the aircraft. Immediately back into action. \\nAccording to the FAA, there were no injuries among the 37 people onboard the Boeing 737, which was arriving from Fort Dodge, Iowa. \\nPence tweeted, \u201cSo thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!\u201d So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow! \\n\u2014 Mike Pence (@mike_pence) October 28, 2016 \\nAccording to an ABC News reporter on the aircraft, the GOP vice-presidential candidate came back to check on everyone on the plane and said there was mud on the windows and the plane had skid onto the grass. \\nAccording to The Associated Press, the plane made a rough impact when it landed. The AP also reported that the pilot slammed on the brakes and passengers could smell burning rubber. \\n\u2014 Ines de La Cuetara (@InesdLC) October 28, 2016 \\nOn one hand, whenever I hear about airplane shenanigans involving high-level American politicians, my first reflex is to assume some kind of nefarious plot. But things seem relatively straightforward here. \\nIt was raining, the runway was slippery, and the plane just had a rough landing. \\nBut if anything, this event will still help the Trump campaign. Because of all the scandals involving the Clintons these days, many people will have a vague suspicion that this might have been an attempt on Pence\u2019s life by system agents. People are already speculating in that direction on Twitter. \\nAgain, there is not reason as of yet to seriously entertain conspiracy theories. But that doesn\u2019t mean those perceptions don\u2019t exist. And it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t affect the election.'"}, "time": 1742628531.0834463}
