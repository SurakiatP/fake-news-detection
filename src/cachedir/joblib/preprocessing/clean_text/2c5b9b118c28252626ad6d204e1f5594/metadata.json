DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech to bash   Donald Trump and defend Hollywood, which she said has become one of the most \u201cvilified\u201d segments of American society. [\u201cHollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners,\u201d Streep said, listing several actors who were born in Canada and other places outside the United States. \u201cAnd if we kick them all out, you\u2019ll have nothing to watch but football and Mixed Martial Arts, which are not the arts. \u201d  At tonight\u2019s #GoldenGlobes we honor Hollywood legend Meryl Streep with the prestigious Cecil B. Demille Award. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017,  The    actress  \u2014   who did not mention Trump by name during her speech  \u2014   also criticized the   for what she called his \u201cinstinct to humiliate. \u201d \u201cDisrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence,\u201d she said. While the Golden Globes audience loved her speech, Streep\u2019s comments drew a strong negative reaction on social media and from some commentators, with many claiming that the actress\u2019s comments served yet again to illustrate the disconnect between rich Hollywood actors and the rest of the country. But Streep\u2019s Golden Globes speech wasn\u2019t the first time the actress has weighed in on politics and current events. Below are five more examples of the actress\u2019s political wisdom. 1. Trump supporters attending political rallies are \u201cdriven to the worst possibilities by the bloodlust in a crowd. \u201d In August, Streep told Variety that she was shocked to hear that Clint Eastwood was supporting Trump in the presidential election. \u201cI\u2019ll have to correct that! I\u2019m shocked. I really am. Because he\u2019s more  \u2014   I would have thought he would be more sensitive than that,\u201d she told the outlet. Streep also weighed in on the phenomenon of people behaving differently in large groups than they would individually, connecting it to supposed violence occurring at Trump\u2019s political rallies. \u201cThe aggregate of everybody\u2019s emotion, it\u2019s such a powerful thing. You can see it in the Trump rallies, where people I just know, in their living rooms, would be better people, are driven to the worst possibilities by the bloodlust in a crowd,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just gets ginned up and they\u2019re outside of themselves. They\u2019re behaving as a larger unit, not just themselves. \u201d 2. Streep puts on a wig, makeup and fat suit to mock Trump during a play, In June, when most observers still believed Trump had no chance to win the election, Streep dressed up as Trump to mock him while performing at a Shakespeare in the Park Theater Gala event in Central Park. \u201cYou\u2019ll let me know, why all the women say no,\u201d the actress sang while performing Cole Porter\u2019s \u201cBrush Up Your Shakespeare\u201d from the Broadway show Kiss Me, Kate.

Christine Baranski joined the fun by dressing as Hillary Clinton. 3. Streep compares Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cgrit and grace\u201d to that of Continental Army soldier Deborah Sampson, who was wounded fighting while disguised as a man during the Revolutionary War. \u201cWhat does it take to be the first female anything? It takes grit, and it takes grace,\u201d Streep said while speaking during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. The actress compared Clinton\u2019s perseverance in the face of adversity to Sampson, who was shot while illegally serving in George Washington\u2019s Continental Army. \u201cWhen she took a blast in battle, to her leg, she was afraid to reveal her secret, so she took out a   dug out the   and sewed herself back up again,\u201d Streep explained. \u201cThat\u2019s grit. \u201d \u201cAnd grace? Hillary Clinton has taken some fire over 40 years of her fight for families and children. How does she do it? That\u2019s what I want to know. Where does she get her grit, and her grace? Where do any of our female firsts, our   where do they find that strength?\u201d 4. The Alar Scare, In 1989, Streep played a major role in the   \u201cAlar scare. \u201d The Natural Resources Defense Council became concerned that fruits  \u2014   specifically apples  \u2014   containing pesticides including Alar, or daminozide, were causing adverse health effects. A segment on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes that featured a skull and crossbones over a photo of apples only exacerbated the public\u2019s fear. In June of 1989, Streep testified before Congress on the dangers of Alar. According to the Washington Post, the actress told  . Joseph Lieberman that she was qualified to speak about Alar because she had been \u201cinvolved\u201d with the issue for four months. The Post reported that Streep told Congress: \u201cI think the reason we have all been invited here, as I look around the room and I see so many experts, is we have been invited for what we do not know, which probably will fill the room. But actually, I do not mind representing the constituency of the great mass of uninformed, because I think what we do not know about this issue is the most alarming, and that is coming up over and over in what I have been hearing. What we don\u2019t know is a frightening chasm. \u201d In the end, the Alar scare crippled the apple business, costing growers an estimated $100 million. \u201cThere was never any legitimate scientific study to justify the Alar scare,\u201d food science professor Dr. Joseph D. Rosen later told the New York Times. 5. Streep uses discredited propaganda to claim Walt Disney was a racist, sexist   During a speech at the National Board of Review awards in January 2014, Streep accused Disney founder Walt Disney of having had \u201cracist proclivities,\u201d said he formed and belonged to an \u201c  lobbying group\u201d and called him a \u201cgender bigot. \u201d But Disney historians lashed out at Streep for relying on \u201c \u201d accusations entirely without merit. \u201cEvery statement she made about Disney was either grossly distorted or outright false,\u201d Cartoon Brew\u2019s Amid Amidi wrote at the time. While social conventions during Disney\u2019s lifetime were undoubtedly more harsh on women and minorities, Disney reportedly employed numerous women during the 1930s, when it was not an accepted industry practice to do so. \u201cIf a woman can do the work as well, she is worth as much as a man,\u201d Disney reportedly told artists working on Dumbo in 1941. \u201cThe girl artists have the right to expect the same chances for advancement as men, and I honestly believe they may eventually contribute something to this business that men never would or could. \u201d As for the   charge, Jewish author Douglas Brode, who wrote a book about Disney culture, told the Hollywood Reporter in 2014: \u201cThere is zero hard evidence that Disney ever wrote or said anything   in private or public. His films feature a wide array of great Jewish actors in the most diverse roles imaginable, more so than any other studio of Hollywood\u2019s golden age, including those run by Jewish movie moguls. Finally, there is no evidence in the work of   via negatively portrayed Jewish characters. \u201d *Hypocrisy Bonus: Streep gives standing ovation to convicted child rapist Roman Polanski at the 2003 Oscars, For all the talk about morality, Streep and several of her Hollywood associates wildly cheered in 2003 when Roman Polanski  \u2014   who was convicted of having sex with a    girl in 1977 and fled the country before sentencing  \u2014   won the Best Director Oscar for The Pianist in 2003.
