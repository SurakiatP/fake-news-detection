[Not only is there no funding for a wall, but  \u2014   thanks to the deft negotiating skills of House Speaker Paul Ryan  \u2014   the bill actually prohibits money from being spent on a wall.  At a CYA press conference on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s ridiculously chipper budget director, Mick Mulvaney, described the bill\u2019s prohibition on building a wall as a MAJOR win. (At least Mulvaney said it in English, unlike his   2014 townhall.) True, there will be no wall. But the Democrats graciously agreed to allow the administration to fix broken parts of any existing fences on up to 40 miles of our 3, 000 mile border. The other big wins, according to Mulvaney, are: 1) more defense spending, which is fantastic news, because I was worried Boeing and Lockheed Martin CEOs were falling behind Mark Zuckerberg with their gluttonous salaries and, 2) school choice, an obsession of Washington wonks that is hated out in America, where parents move to   towns for the express purpose of avoiding schools full of disaffected urban youth, and the disaffected urban youth don\u2019t want to spend two hours on a bus every day. But Mulvaney assures us that this monstrosity of a spending bill has set things up beautifully for the next budget negotiation in October. That has become the GOP\u2019s official motto: \u201cNext time!\u201d We can never win this time. Instead, Republicans\u2019 idea is always to surrender this time, in hopes that their gentlemanliness will be rewarded by their mortal enemies next time. Then, next time comes, and Republicans again surrender in hopes of currying favor with the Democrats and the media for the next time. Mulvaney\u2019s most disturbing comment was to say that what upset Trump the most was the Democrats\u2019 \u201cspiking the football\u201d on this deal. Apparently, Trump\u2019s fine with no wall  \u2014   and everything else in a bill straight out of George Soros\u2019 dream journal  \u2014   if only the Democrats hadn\u2019t been so rude as to tell the public about it. When your main complaint is that the other side is gloating too much, maybe you\u2019re not that great a negotiator. Yeah, sure, it\u2019s only 100 days in, it\u2019s an artificial deadline, the media is dying to say Trump has failed and so on. Except: Planning for the wall should have begun on Nov. 9, and a spade should have been put into the earth to begin building it the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Now, it\u2019s 100 days later, and we still don\u2019t have the whisper of a prospect of a wall. Moreover, this isn\u2019t one random bill funding Planned Parenthood (which this bill does). This is the budget deal. There won\u2019t be another one like it until next October. That\u2019s a spectacular failure. Democrats have got to be pinching themselves, thinking, Am I dreaming this? It\u2019s theoretically possible that Trump could still build a wall, but he\u2019s just massively lengthened the odds of ever prevailing. Sure, you can let the other team build a   lead in first half and still come back to beat them, but it\u2019s a lot easier if you don\u2019t go into halftime 20 points down. Trump entered the presidency with the only kind of power that matters. He didn\u2019t owe Wall Street a thing. He didn\u2019t owe anyone  \u2014   not donors, lobbyists nor any political party. What he had was the people, passionately on his side. But as soon as he got into office, Trump started giving away his miraculous, unprecedented power. Hey, Wall Street! Even though you didn\u2019t give me any money, is it too late to be your friend? No amount of abandoning his supporters will get Trump anywhere with Wall Street, Hollywood or the media. Their ferocity will simply shift to ridicule. Admittedly, Trump has the enormous handicap of having to work through congressional Republicans, who are feckless cowards. If Speaker Ryan and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell had been around for Reagan\u2019s firing of the air traffic controllers, they would have been hysterically screaming, No! You can\u2019t do that  \u2014   the planes will crash! This isn\u2019t new information. We knew Washington Republicans were useless. That\u2019s why we elected such a comically improbable president as Donald J. Trump. The deal was that we were getting the Hollywood version of a New York businessman: an uncouth, incurious rube  \u2014   who would be ruthless in getting whatever he wanted. In addition to being the only candidate for president in either party taking America\u2019s side on trade, immigration, jobs and crime, what set Trump apart was his promise that we would finally win. Remember? There would be so much winning, we were going to get \u201csick and tired of winning,\u201d and beg him, \u201cPlease, please, we can\u2019t win anymore.   \u2026     It\u2019s too much. It\u2019s not fair to everybody else. \u201d We\u2019re not winning. We\u2019re losing, and we\u2019re losing on the central promise of Trump\u2019s campaign. How would Trump, the businessman, react if an underling charged with developing a new golf course could never break ground? What if the subordinate\u2019s progress reports sounded like this: I have given 21 speeches to various chambers of commerce and neighborhood groups, assuring them that there\u2019s going to be a golf course. Everywhere I go, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s going to be built!\u201d I have started a commission to study developing a golf course. I have put up a sign saying, \u201cGolf course coming!\u201d And I have caved, and caved, and caved  \u2014   so now our opponents know what good guys we are. Trump would fire that employee so fast your head would spin. We want the ruthless businessman we were promised.'"}, "time": 1742562293.026635}
