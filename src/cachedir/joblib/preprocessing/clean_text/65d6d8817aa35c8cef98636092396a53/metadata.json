You have tested my heart, searched it in the night. You have tried me by fire, but find no malice in me. My mouth has not transgressed as others often do. As your lips have instructed me, I have kept from the way of the lawless. My steps have kept to your paths; my feet have not faltered. I call upon you; answer me, O God. Turn your ear to me; hear my speech. Show your wonderful mercy, you who deliver with your right arm those who seek refuge from their foes. Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings from the wicked who despoil me. My ravenous enemies press upon me; they close their hearts, they fill their mouths with proud roaring. Their steps even now encircle me; they watch closely, keeping low to the ground, Like lions eager for prey, like a young lion lurking in ambush. Rise, O LORD, confront and cast them down; rescue my soul from the wicked. I am just\u2014let me see your face; when I awake, let me be filled with your presence. \\nTwo days from now, Americans will each go to our respective polling stations to cast our ballots for the gravest, most consequential election in our lifetime. \\nMay God send the Holy Spirit and the Archangel Michael to help us. \\nMay God have mercy on us, a sinful people. 2 Thessalonians 2:7, 9-12 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. [T]he one whose coming springs from the power of Satan in every mighty deed and in signs and wonders that lie, and in every wicked deceit for those who are perishing because they have not accepted the love of truth so that they may be saved. Therefore, God is sending them a deceiving power so that they may believe the lie, that all who have not believed the truth but have approved wrongdoing may be condemned. 2 Thessalonians 3:1-3, 5 Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us, so that the word of the Lord may speed forward and be glorified, as it did among you, and that we may be delivered from perverse and wicked people, for not all have faith. But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one. May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.'"}, "time": 1742564136.0810654}
