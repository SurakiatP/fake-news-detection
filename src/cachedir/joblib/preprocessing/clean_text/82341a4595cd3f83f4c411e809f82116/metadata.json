Ross Cameron / AP \\nGermany and other European countries have a thriving multiparty political culture. The U.S. used to have one too. In 1916, five parties were seated in Congress. \\nIn his Washington Post article \u201cIn Europe, the Green Party is a force. In the U.S., it\u2019s irrelevant. Here\u2019s why,\u201d Per Urlaub, associate professor of German studies at the University of Texas, contends that \u201cthe American electoral system is heavily weighted against small political parties.\u201d \\nHe\u2019s right. Alternative parties must wrestle with ballot-access laws, enacted since 1916 by Democratic and Republican legislators in many states, that privilege major-party candidates and hinder others. In some states, alternative parties are effectively banned from participation. \\nWhen alternative parties do get on the ballot, their candidates often face the \u201cspoiler\u201d accusation. The supposed spoiler effect can be eliminated by replacing the prevailing \u201cfirst past the post\u201d system with \u201cranked choice,\u201d which allows people to rank their preferences. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nReforms like ranked choice voting (RCV) and proportional representation\u2014which gave Germany and other European countries their multiparty legislatures\u2014are considered radical here, even though they grant voters greater power and more options. \\nGreens have urged such reforms for years, but Democrats and Republicans prefer to maintain their exclusive hold. A chance for RCV in California died in early October with Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s veto. \\nThe major parties solidified their grip in 1988, when the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) seized control of the debates from the League of Women Voters. Contrary to its \u201cnonpartisan\u201d label, the CPD is run by Democratic and Republican representatives for the benefit of their own candidates. The League has called the CPD debates a \u201cfraud on the American voter.\u201d \\nThe CPD adopted its poll-based criteria to determine participation in the debates after the 1998 gubernatorial election in Minnesota. Independent candidate Jesse Ventura was dismissed as \u201cnot viable,\u201d with a tiny percentage in the polls until he was allowed to participate in a debate. His poll numbers shot up and he went on to win. \\nWhen the CPD witnessed what happened in Minnesota, it raised the requirement to 15 percent in the polls in 2000 to spare Al Gore and George W. Bush from facing Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan in the debates. \\nThe CPD\u2019s rules aren\u2019t meant to bar \u201cunviable\u201d candidates, they\u2019re designed to keep alternative-party candidates from becoming viable. \\nThere\u2019s nothing inevitable about having only two parties. We don\u2019t have a two-party system, we have a two-party racket. \\nVoters are aware they\u2019ve been cheated. Their frustration is evident in polls showing they favor more options than two on Election Day, and the high disapproval ratings for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. \\nRadical? Only in the U.S. \\nPer Urlaub\u2019s main complaint about the U.S. Green Party is its \u201cradicalism.\u201d In fact, the U.S. has a long history of radical alternative-party ideas. \\nAbolition of slavery, women\u2019s suffrage, the eight-hour workday, worker benefits, public schools, unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, child labor laws, direct election of senators, Social Security, civil rights for blacks and other disenfranchised peoples\u2014all were first represented in the electoral forum by alternative parties. \\nMarginalization of minor parties in the late 20th century is an unmentioned reason for the shift to the right in both major parties and the disappearance of big progressive ideas. \\nObamacare isn\u2019t a big progressive idea. It\u2019s a repackaging of the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s individual mandate proposal and RomneyCare, implemented by then-governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, from Massachusetts. It was drafted by Democrats with the participation of insurance-industry representatives. \\nGreens support a single-payer health care program, so that Americans can have the guaranteed medical care enjoyed by citizens of every other democratic developed nation. Only in the U.S. is universal health care dismissed as radical and unrealistic. \\nUrlaub never mentions what makes the U.S. Green Party radical. He does, however, cite projects for conversion to clean, renewable energy that are implemented in Europe and advocated by presidential nominee Jill Stein and other Green candidates in the \u201c Green New Deal ,\u201d which aims for freedom from fossil fuels by 2030. \\nGlobal warming was nearly absent from the three Clinton-Trump debates, even after Hurricane Matthew pounded Haiti and the Southern states. \\nYoung people will live with the consequences of rule by two parties awash in corporate money and influence. Millennials face an era of deteriorating quality of life, increasing personal debt, exported jobs, eroded rights and freedoms, lawless militarism, and social breakdown as the planet heats up.'"}, "time": 1742628495.6251287}
