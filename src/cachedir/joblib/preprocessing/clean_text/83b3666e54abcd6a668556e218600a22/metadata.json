Consider this claim: \u201cDonald Trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation \u2026 and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce imports\u2026.\u201d\\nCut taxes? Bunk. Trump famously promises to raise taxes on Americans who buy imports. Reduce regulation? Rubbish. Trump promises more government intrusions into Americans\u2019 commerce with foreigners.\\nAs for \u2018eliminating\u2019 our trade deficit, Trump might indeed succeed on that front. But such \u2018success\u2019 would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the American economy being made an unattractive destination for investment. (Ross and Navarro seem to be unaware that to \u201celiminate our trade deficit\u201d \u2013 such as was done, for example, during the Great Depression \u2013 is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of America\u2019s capital stock.)\\nBut Trump\u2019s most absurd promise is to enrich Americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. Imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. Therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force Americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return \u2013 a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired.\\nBut the Trump camp\u2019s confusion runs even more deeply. Exporting for Americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. So a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase people\u2019s spending power and to decrease it. It\u2019s a policy meant to give Americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips Americans of the freedom to use those means. It\u2019s the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle.\\nSincerely,\\nDonald J.
