In separate interviews, Roberts asked if Trump\u2019s tweets had the nefarious motive, first with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and then with former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. Trump\u2019s tweet about Saturday\u2019s terror attacks in London read, \u201cWe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don\u2019t get smart it will only get worse. \u201d Roberts asked Reed, \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want us to be politically correct, right? So let\u2019s not be PC about this. Is the president trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack with this Twitter rant, because, only to prove himself right?\u201d Roberts later repeated the inquiry to Dean, \u201cI asked this of Mayor Reed, but it seems like the president is trying to provoke something that he can politicize more for his own gain in America. Do you feel that way?\u201d Dean answered,\u201dI just think he\u2019s  \u2014   well, I think he\u2019s totally incompetent. \u201d (  Daily Caller) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN '"}, "time": 1742562055.2499003}
