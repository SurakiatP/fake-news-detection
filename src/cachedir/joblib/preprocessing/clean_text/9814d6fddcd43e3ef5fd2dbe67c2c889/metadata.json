[Just as in the United States, it was not just struggling   workers fed up with the flip side of globalisation who rebelled last year.  \u201cWe continually underestimate the silent majority,\u201d said Richard Heffernan, an expert in government at The Open University, which was set up in Milton Keynes shortly after the town was established in 1967. Three days after the inauguration of billionaire property tycoon Donald Trump as US president on January 20, the town will celebrate its 50th anniversary. Enjoying some of the best employment and growth rates in Britain, Milton Keynes could have been fertile ground for those backing the status quo in Britain\u2019s 2016 vote on whether to stay in the European Union. But the   town voted by 51 percent for Britain to leave the bloc, closely mirroring the   vote split across the country. Alongside the state of the economy, Britons who voted to leave the EU said their two other motivating factors were the influx of East European immigrants and the importance of national sovereignty. In Milton Keynes, the latter seemed to dominate. \u201cIt was not so much immigration as sovereignty and accountability,\u201d    retired nurse Diana Miller said of her Leave vote as she toured an exhibition to mark the town\u2019s anniversary. In the 1975 referendum on Britain\u2019s entry into what was then the European Economic Community, \u201cwe voted for the common market, not a loss of sovereignty,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a powerful country, we value our independence. \u201d  \u2014   \u2018Bang on the money\u2019  \u2014   The townsfolk put their concerns over the EU directly to then prime minister David Cameron in a television special four days before the June 23 referendum. Voters quizzed Cameron on immigration, the possibility of Turkish accession to the bloc and the idea of spending more money on the National Health Service (NHS) instead of the EU budget. The Brexit result exposed a gulf between   metropolitan types and the     north, just as the US vote revealed divisions between city liberals and rural conservatives. Yet in both countries, it was quiet support in those places in between that really made the difference. \u201cAs the nation goes, so goes Milton Keynes,\u201d said Heffernan. \u201cIt\u2019s moderate, centrist, and since 1997 it has been an electoral bellwether, in the same way as Ohio in the United States. \u201cIn terms of Brexit, it was bang on the money. \u201d But the depth of its euroscepticism did not set alarm bells ringing for the establishment, despite political parties spending years doing focus groups in Milton Keynes, seen it as a microcosm of public opinion. \u201cA lot of people who study politics and analyse it are part of a metropolitan elite,\u201d Heffernan told AFP. \u201cThe liberal elite\u2019s inability to represent many people was held against them. \u201d Following the Brexit and Trump votes there are now a plethora of   movements in Europe seeking to rise up against urban and political elites, as well as against Brussels, and \u201creturn\u201d their countries to the struggling middle classes.  \u2014   Boomtown backs Brexit  \u2014   The   story of Milton Keynes is being told in an exhibition entitled \u201cA New City Comes To Life\u201d which is located in the main shopping centre. Built as a 1960s futuristic vision, its   layout is unique in Britain and its   boulevards were   for the motor age. Sited in the prosperous southeast of England, its major local employers include Spanish bank Santander and German carmakers Volkswagen and  . It has seen the highest jobs growth of any British city, up 18 percent between 2004 and 2013. Milton   Katherine Moore, 31, who is qualified in catering but off work while looking after her baby, said: \u201cThere\u2019s always good job opportunities here. If you\u2019re trained in those fields, there\u2019s so much work. I will never leave. \u201cThe only reason I voted out was the NHS. But we need the foreign people, they built it up. \u201d Heffernan said it was alienation, not apathy, that stirred hitherto silent centrists into backing Brexit and Trump. \u201cIt applies to   professionals as much as to people who hammer metal,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians are now like rabbits caught in the headlights. They\u2019re aware the guy driving at them doesn\u2019t like them  \u2014   and they don\u2019t know what to do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563347.6534321}
