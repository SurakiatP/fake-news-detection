More importantly, Newt Gingrich was 100% accurate with his comment about Megan and her word choice. Ask yourself, why could she not bring herself to use \"predator\" and Bill Clinton in the same sentence? If these allegations are true, why wouldn\\'t these women have filed lawsuits against a billionair, seeking monetary compensation at the time of the sexual assaults? I would like to point out that every charge of sexual impropriety\\'s against Trump - twenty prior to this last gaggle of liars - have been dismissed or have had not guilty verdicts...each and every one. And it\\'s important to note, none has had a monetary settlement. Why are these women only coming out with their stories 10, 20 years after their bogus claims? Each of these women should be found guilty of interfering with a presidential election, making false charges, and damaging the believability of sexual assault charges by any woman in the future. These women need to be spending some time in prison. Should the Democratic Party be linked to these women\\'s allegations, especially should there have been money exchanged, either Hillary or Bill or both need to be behind bars as well.'"}, "time": 1742561788.6784554}
