The authorities said the shooting was an accident. A man who had just bought a bagel and a cup of coffee was adjusting his waistband, causing the gun he had tucked in his pants to fire, shooting himself in the leg. About 30 people were inside the cafe, which is part of the upscale market on the Upper West Side, when the gun went off, workers in the store said. The man, identified by the police as Louis Lester Anderson, 48, hurried away from the store, on the corner of Broadway and 80th Street, and took himself to Mount Sinai St. Luke\u2019s, where he was treated and found by the police. He has been taken into police custody, officials said. The matter was being investigated. Officials said Mr. Anderson told the police that he had found the gun in Midtown and had dropped it in a grassy area near Riverside Drive, where the police found it. They said Mr. Anderson, who is homeless, had been arrested nine previous times, mostly on   charges. For about three hours after the shooting, the cafe was cordoned off by police tape, keeping out regulars. But before too long, they returned and were back shopping. \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual,\u201d the store\u2019s general manager, Scott Goldshine, said. \u201cIt was very quick,\u201d Mr. Goldshine added. \u201cNobody got hurt. Our staff is fine, and we\u2019re back open for business. \u201d Jim Wintner was among the first customers to buy a sandwich after the cafe reopened. \u201cPeople were flying in here before I could even get in the door,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re New Yorkers  \u2014   we have to have our Zabar\u2019s. \u201d But with the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. fresh on the minds of many in the neighborhood, they said they could not help but fear at first blush that something worse was happening. \u201cMy mind is still on Orlando because my wife lives there,\u201d Mr. Wintner said. Beryl Swados usually comes in for coffee every morning. \u201cI\u2019m literally there every day, and I would have been there had I not been with clients,\u201d said Ms. Swados, who works at Canine Styles, the grooming service and pet product store. \u201cBut what\u2019s horrifying is this isn\u2019t just being in a bad neighborhood this is the Upper West Side, for God\u2019s sake. \u201d Marlene Silva said she heard about the shooting while at physical therapy at a nearby gym, but still came by the store after it had reopened. \u201cNo one is safe anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing is sacred anymore. \u201d But she was sanguine in her approach to handling her fears. \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cBe a hermit in your own house?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562266.7401881}
