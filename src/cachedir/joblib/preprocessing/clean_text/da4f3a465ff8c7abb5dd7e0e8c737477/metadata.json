The IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to Reuters. The agency told Reuters on Tuesday that it tried to protect the study from \u201cexternal interference,\u201d as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was \u201cthe sole owner of such materials.\u201d \\nThe scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under US freedom of information laws.\\nThe groundbreaking review, published in March 2015 by the IARC \u2013 a semi-autonomous agency of the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 labeled the glyphosate herbicide as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d Glyphosate is a key ingredient of Monsanto\u2019s flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name \u2018Roundup.\u2019 It is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified \u201cRoundup Ready\u201d crops, also produced by Monsanto.\\nThe IARC\u2019s report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself.\\nThe report sparked a heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several EU countries \u2013 including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands \u2013 to object to the renewal of the glyphosate\u2019s EU license. The vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in June 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration.\\nThe controversial report has seemingly made the IARC a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions.\\nVarious critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the IARC\u2019s evaluations are fuel for \u201cunnecessary health scares,\u201d since the IARC allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a \u201ctypical human\u201d exposure to it. It remained unclear whether the critics urged a WHO body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans.\\nThe critics also brought up other controversial statements from the IARC, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer.\\nThe agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and \u201cwidely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and\u2026freedom from conflicts of interest.\u201d Numerous freedom of information requests by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a US conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning.\\nE&E Legal told Reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the IARC or to the US federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. Basically, it\u2019s being decided whether the IARC, as part of the WHO, is truly independent and free from \u201cconflicts of interest.\u201d \\nAccording to Reuters, officials from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why American taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens.\\n\u201cIARC\u2019s standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,\u201d a letter from US Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to NIH director Francis Collins states, as quoted by Reuters.\\nThe Oversight Committee demanded a full disclosure of NIH funding of the IARC, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agency\u2019s activities.\\nIARC opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which believes glyphosate is \u201cunlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans,\u201d promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its \u201ccommitment to open risk assessment.\u201d The food safety watchdog made this statement in late September, and still has to deliver the promised information.\\nSource: RT News \\n'"}, "time": 1742563072.1235368}
