And with an urgent call out for people to come and commit civil disobedience to stop this pipeline, there is lots of need for more allies to come and throw down. \\nA group of folks called Solidariteam put together a resource packet for people who are showing up without much experience or history with Indigenous spaces and communities; as one member wrote, the packet is \u201cfor folks that are navigating the complexities of power, privilege, settler colonialism, shame, solidarity, support, taking leadership from Indigenous communities and taking action.\u201d \\nThe packet includes information about camp culture, questions to ask yourself before going (and ways you can help from home that you might not have thought of; a lot of folks have skills that make them way more useful at home than in the camp), and cultural protocols written with guidance from camp elders. \\nYou can find the packet and download the tools at standingrocksolidaritynetwork.org/resource-packet . And when you\u2019re done, check out the rest of the website for more useful info: finding out current needs and which donation sites are legitimate, sources of Indigenous history and analysis, connect with local organizing in your town, and more.  \""}, "time": 1742562228.0002499}
