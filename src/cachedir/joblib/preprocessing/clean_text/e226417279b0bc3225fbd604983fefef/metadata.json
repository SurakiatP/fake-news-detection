Proceeds, he said, would go toward supporting the multiple women who have accused Trump of sexual assault. \\nThe stars are maintained by the Hollywood Historic Trust, and the group has already said that the individual responsible will be prosecuted \"to the full extent of the law,\" and repairs are already underway. \u2014 Adelle Nazarian (@AdelleNaz) October 26, 2016 \\n\"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,\" said Leron Gubler, head of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, according to Deadline. \"When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark.\" \\nIf found guilty, the individual responsible could face up to three years in jail and a fine of $10,000. \\nThe Trump star has been vandalized on a number of occasions since he began his presidential campaign. In January, a vandal spray-painted a reverse swastika over the star. \u2014 afterglow (@afterglow2046) October 26, 2016 \\nTwo similar incidents occurred over the summer. In June, a mute sign was spray-painted over the spot. One month later, a street artist erected a miniaturized wall around the star, a reference to the Republican candidate\u2019s proposal to construct a barrier along the US-Mexico border. \\nOf course, given that his divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail appears to be affecting his brand, Trump may soon start defacing his own properties. Amid rumors that the billionaire is removing the Trump name from his hotels, the Trump organization has announced plans to launch a new brand under the less identifiable name \"Scion.\" ...'"}, "time": 1742563210.0454965}
