I think we now have a definitive answer: \u201cThese blast points on Hillary\u2019s campaign\u2026 too accurate for the Mainstream Media. Only the forces of the Imperial Deep State are so precise.\u201d\\n\\nThe Mainstream Media is presenting the FBI investigation as a \u201close-lose\u201d situation for embattled FBI Director Comey. If Comey remained quiet until after the election, he would be accused of colluding with the Clinton campaign and its allies in the Department of Justice (sic).\\nBut in going public, he stands accused by Democrats of \u201cintervening in an election,\u201d i.e. raising doubts about Hillary\u2019s judgement and veracity days before Americans go to the polls.\\nAnother narrative has Comey\u2019s hand forced by the threat of disgusted FBI agents leaking information that would show the FBI caved into political pressure from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign to keep relevant material out of the public eye until after the election.\\nI submit another much more powerful dynamic is in play: the upper ranks of the Deep State now view Hillary as an unacceptable liability. The word came down to Comey to act whether he wanted to or not, i.e. take one for the good of the nation/Deep State/Imperial Project.\\nAs a refresher: the Deep State is the unelected government (also called the invisible or shadow government) that is not as monolithic as generally assumed.\\nThe neo-conservative globalists who want Hillary to continue pushing their agenda are the more visible camp, but another less visible but highly motivated camp realizes Hillary and her neo-con agenda would severely damage the nation\u2019s security and its global influence. It is this camp that is arranging for Hillary to lose.\\nThe consensus view seems to be that the Establishment and the Deep State see Trump as a loose cannon who might upset the neo-con apple cart by refusing to toe the neo-con line.\\nThis view overlooks the reality that significant segments of the Deep State view the neo-con strategy as an irredeemable failure. To these elements of the Deep State, Hillary is a threat precisely because she embraces the failed neo-con strategy and those who cling to it. From this point of view, Hillary as president would be an unmitigated disaster for the Deep State and the nation/Imperial Project it governs.\\nWhatever else emerges from the emails being leaked or officially released, one conclusion is inescapable: Hillary\u2019s judgement is hopelessly flawed. Combine her lack of judgement with her 24 years of accumulated baggage and her potential to push the neo-con agenda to the point of global disaster, and you get a potent need for the Deep State\u2019s most prescient elements to derail her campaign and clear a path to Trump\u2019s executive team.\\nOnce this path is clear, the management of Trump\u2019s executive team can begin in earnest, a management process aimed at disengaging the nation and its global Empire from neo-con overreach.\\nIf you think this scenario is \u201cimpossible,\u201d let\u2019s see how the election plays out before deciding what\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d and what\u2019s inevitable.
