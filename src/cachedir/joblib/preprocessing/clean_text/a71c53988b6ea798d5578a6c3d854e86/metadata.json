[Both were prompted by the Centre For Medical Progress (CMP) undercover investigation, which caught Planned Parenthood officials discussing how to illegally profit from selling baby parts. The first report in December was by the Senate Judiciary Committee and now House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel has published its report. Neither investigation relied on the CMP undercover videos to come to their conclusions. They carried out their own investigations  \u2014   interviewing officials and employees under oath and using the power of subpoena to get their records.  What they found is horrifying and criminal. It\u2019s disturbing that the results have been virtually ignored in the mainstream media. So to fill this gap, here are the top eight horrifying facts the mainstream media doesn\u2019t want you know about aborted babies bodies being sold for profit. 1) It\u2019s wrong to say the   crowd don\u2019t value the disabled. Advanced Biosciences Resources (ABR) had a \u201ctechnician\u201d embedded at a Planned Parenthood clinic who reportedly harvested and sold the skin of a Down Syndrome baby for $325. Yes, that\u2019s correct, in America today, you can buy the skin of an aborted Down Syndrome child for $325. The same baby\u2019s leg was sold for $325. 2) Selling baby parts is very profitable. To be clear, the law is unambiguous it is illegal to make a profit providing organs or any part of a human for research or medical treatment. But Planned Parenthood and their business partners made a lot of money selling aborted baby body parts, according to the report. The House investigation found one case where Stem Express harvested an intact aborted baby\u2019s brain at a Planned Parenthood clinic. They reportedly paid Planned Parenthood $55 but sold the brain to a researcher for over $3000  \u2014    that\u2019s a 2, 800% profit. Planned Parenthood reportedly made their money on volume sales and \u201ccharitable donations\u201d from these body harvesting companies. The Senate investigation published invoices which showed in June 2014 ABR bought a fetus from Planned Parenthood for $60. From that one fetus ABR \u201csold its brain to one customer for $325 both of its eyes for $325 each ($650 total) to a second customer, a portion of its liver for $325 to a third customer its thymus for $325 and another portion of liver to a fourth customer and its lung for $325 to a fifth customer. \u201d Then, the report says, they piled on fees for \u201cdisease screening\u201d and shipping. That one aborted baby reportedly brought the company $2, 275. The House Investigative Panel found Stem Express generally marked up the baby parts by 400% to 600%. 3) A bountiful harvest, And \u201charvesting\u201d is exactly what they were doing. The House investigation uncovered how \u201ctechnicians\u201d would look at the patient list in advance and try to sell the baby parts before the abortion. After securing the advance sale (with its massive profits) the technician would then be allowed to go and ask the pregnant woman to sign a consent form. This is a huge ethical breach. The person seeking consent from a vulnerable patient is supposed to be neutral in the process. In a letter to HHS last June, the panel wrote: \u201cThe fact that StemExpress was attempting to interest a customer in fetal body parts before an abortion had taken place raises serious concerns that there may have been coercion or undue influence upon the patient to consent to procurement\u201d (their emphasis). 4) Sticks and stones, And like any other business, there can be frustrations between buyers and sellers. The House Panel uncovered an email exchange between an excited Stem Express \u201ctechnician\u201d and a researcher who wanted to know if she could expect some parts the next day because she needed to book time at a very expensive research machine. But a baby\u2019s body is a frustratingly fragile thing. Rather apologetically, the Stem Express employee told the researcher he had a body but: \u201cThe calvarium [skull] is mostly intact, with a tear up the back of the suture line, but all pieces look to be there. The limbs, one upper and one lower, are totally intact, with one upper broken at the humerus, and one lower broken right above the knee. Please let me know if these are acceptable. \u201d They were. The deal was done and a baby\u2019s body, complete with a  broken leg and arm, was shipped overnight to the researcher. 5) Kermit Gosnell was not alone. If there is one thing the abortion defenders agree on, it\u2019s that mass murderer Dr Kermit Gosnell was a   an aberration. In a Supreme Court judgment referencing Gosnell, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg described him as \u201crogue. \u201d Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic explained most people believe \u201cGosnell is an aberration that says nothing larger about abortion in America. \u201d And Slate writer William Saletan described Gosnell as an \u201coutlier. \u201d But then you read the House Investigation Report. They have interviewed, taken evidence, and secured affidavits from employees and patients of a Texas abortion doctor (whose name they have redacted). I have made a movie and written a book about Kermit Gosnell and his   killing spree, and the similarities with this Texas doctor are shocking. According to one employee, the doctor would perform around 40 late   or   abortions every week. Of these abortions, \u201cthree to four infants would show signs of life. \u201d And just like Gosnell, the doctor would immediately kill them, according to the testimony. The employee said he employed Gosnell\u2019s techniques of \u201csnipping the infant\u2019s spinal cord with scissors. \u201d However, he reportedly also cut the neck with Sopher forceps: \u201ctwisting the infants head: using forceps  \u2026     or his finger to crush the \u2018soft spot\u2019 of the infant\u2019s head. \u201d Sometimes the doctor would also kill by crushing the stomach of the child or \u201cinserting his finger down the throat,\u201d according to the testimony. And just like Gosnell  \u2014   the doctor reportedly would manipulate ultrasounds to make babies appear smaller so he could perform illegal   abortions. And just like Gosnell, he had unqualified staff administering drugs and carrying out abortions, according to the report. 6) Planned Parenthood HQ accused of conspiring to break the law. After the baby selling scandal broke, Planned Parenthood told the media they had a policy that prevented their affiliates from profiting from the process. But they didn\u2019t mention that they had brought the policy in just as the CMP scandal developed. In fact, this report suggests a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d over their failure to have guidelines before this. According to the Senate Judicial Committee report, in 2001 Planned Parenthood did have a policy stating its clinics had to have an independent accountant verify they were not profiting from the sale of body parts. Those who did not follow these guidelines could be thrown out of the Planned Parenthood network, they were warned. In 2011, when they found their clinics were ignoring the guidelines, Planned Parenthood quietly deleted the guidelines from its requirements. By doing so, Planned Parenthood headquarters made it quite clear they would not stand in the way of their clinics profiting from the sale of baby parts. Or, as the Senate Committee put it, by behaving \u201cin a manner that facilitated the continuation of those fetal tissue payments. Planned Parenthood and the affiliates actions may implicate the federal criminal conspiracy statute   371. \u201d 7) Privacy for thee and not for me, Planned Parenthood and the companies it was selling baby parts to fought tooth and nail against the investigations. They claimed privacy was an issue. But the House Investigation states they never cared about privacy when there was a lot of money to be made selling the body parts of their patients\u2019 babies. They would regularly give confidential information about their patients to help the companies plan their harvesting in advance, the report says. And Stem Express would reportedly share this information with clients so they could look at what might be available and place advance orders. The committee said: \u201cthe [Planned Parenthood] abortion clinics did not have a valid reason to provide, patients\u2019 PHI [Protected Health Information]. Instead the abortion clinics shared patients\u2019 PHI with Stem Express in furtherance of contractual agreements that financially benefited StemExpress and the clinics. \u201d They recommended an investigation \u201cand, if OHRP agrees that [privacy] violations occurred, to take all appropriate actions. \u201d 8) Planned Parenthood falsely claimed to help cure AIDS. Yes, you read that right  \u2014   in order to convince women to allow them to harvest their baby\u2019s body parts, the Planned Parenthood consent form told the vulnerable women that the parts had been used to find a cure for AIDS. As a Planned Parenthood official admitted under oath to the House investigation, \u201cthere is no cure for AIDS. So that is probably an inaccurate statement. \u201d They also reportedly misled clients about what they were actually harvesting. The consent form only described \u201cpregnancy tissue\u201d  \u2014   not a baby\u2019s arms, legs, eyes, brains, and skin.
