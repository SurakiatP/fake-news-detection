[\u201cChina\u2019s breakneck economic expansion may be flagging, but the country\u2019s ambitions in space show no signs of slowing down,\u201d wrote CNBC. \u201cAlongside ongoing efforts to rival NASA by placing robotic landers, and eventually astronauts, on the moon and Mars, China\u2019s government is increasingly looking to its burgeoning space sector to rival U.

S.  analysts have expressed concern that NASA is reining in its ambitions as China expands its footprint in orbit and beyond,\u201d CNBC concluded. \u201cBut that could change if President Trump decides to reenergize NASA and shift its priorities. Already he has expressed interest in trying to create a \u2018Kennedy moment\u2019 again. \u201d You can read the full article at CNBC.'"}, "time": 1742561745.2883754}
