Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Berkeley\u2019s Undocumented Student Program , which the university established in 2012, works with more than 400 undocumented students and continues to grow as more go public about their immigration status, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves and their families. \\nBut by coming out of the shadows, undocumented people open themselves to cruelty and threats. Last year, when I helped organize a campus protest to get the University of California to renew funding for some crucial programs for undocumented students, I was called an illegal leech who should be deported. I shrugged it off: I was proud of marching at Berkeley, where the Free Speech Movement started in the 1960s. \\nBut looking back, I think I should have made a bigger deal about the maliciousness I witnessed and saw building. A few months later, I received an anonymous email threatening to report my family and me to immigration agents. The threat included details about my actions during the protest \u2014 it seemed to be coming from someone who had seen me on campus. I was so disturbed I stopped attending classes, and even when I returned a week later, my anxiety kept me from engaging in class discussions or focusing on my studies. \\nSoon after that, the Undocumented Student Program began to receive anonymous email threats about students, and a fellow undocumented friend \u2014 a prominent member of the student government \u2014 was told by another student on Facebook: \u201cThanks for identifying yourself as an illegal \u2026 Now get out. I\u2019ll look for you on campus.\u201d All of this information was brought to the administration, but there was no follow-up. \\nI.e., the illegal alien is complaining there was no follow up against the American citizens for reporting the presence of illegal aliens. \\n\u2026 This September, after a group of Trump supporters came onto campus to build a mock wall and spew racially charged talk about \u201cillegals,\u201d the undocumented students were told to draft a statement of inclusion as a response, and that perhaps certain departments would send it through their email listservs as a gesture of support. \\nAdministrators have said they are determined to earn our trust, but undocumented students on campus don\u2019t want to be placated \u2014 we want our administrators to fully stand with us through actions and not just promises. After all, when posters with anti-Semitic language began to crop up around campus in late September, the associate chancellor took swift action by sending an email to all students condemning this language. \\nSome argue that hateful displays of racism or anti-Semitism are different from the actions of those on campus who yell, \u201cBuild a wall!\u201d But too often, hate speech toward immigrants in this country is written off as political opinion, and school administrators don\u2019t want to side with one political group or another. However, this political issue happens to be our futures, in the country where we grew up. \\nThat\u2019s why it was disheartening when Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system \u2014 and, it should be noted, the former head of the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 wrote, in a Boston Globe op-ed essay , that students must be willing to listen to not just opposing views, but offensive ones, for the sake of free speech. She did not condone hate speech \u2014 \u201cthat which is designed to personally intimidate or harass\u201d \u2014 but wrote that exceptions to free speech should be \u201cnarrowly construed.\u201d \\nSo many powerful college administrators across the country have made this argument now that I think they have no idea just how offensive speech has gotten, especially during this election. \\nThis is not to say that those with conservative opinions should be silenced. \\nJeb\u2019s opinions on undocumented workers, for example, should not be silenced. \\nBut because it is often campus conservatives who complain of the scourge of political correctness, I think it is tempting for college administrators to rally behind conservative students, to see them as the new gadflies, the protectors of free speech. Yet it is comical to think that those of us with lesser rights are somehow infringing on those who have no fear of deportation. \\nJuan Prieto is a senior at the University of California, Berkeley. \\nNow, you might think that there\u2019s something ungracious about an illegal alien denouncing America\u2019s First Amendment. But \u2014 don\u2019t you realize? \u2014 he\u2019s Undocumented ? That makes him holier than you. Some topics, such as immigration policy, are therefore just too sacred to be discussed anywhere where there are undocumented workers, undocumented students, undocumented welfare recipients, or undocumented criminals, such as the United States. \\nPersonally, I\u2019m an undocumented alumnus of Berkeley with an undocumented Ph.D. in physics and an undocumented Nobel Prize. For some reason, though, the King of Sweden wasn\u2019t welcoming of me the last time I walked up on stage with my speech. \u201cNot you again,\u201d the king said. \u201c Garde !\u201d \\nI blame Trump.'"}, "time": 1742562033.646559}
