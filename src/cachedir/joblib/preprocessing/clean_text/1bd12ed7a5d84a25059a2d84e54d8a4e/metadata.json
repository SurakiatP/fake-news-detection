Times have published a scathing editorial about the protesters who ran riot at Berkeley last week, calling them the \u201cNo Free Speech Movement. \u201d[The label is an inversion of the Free Speech Movement, an   student activist group that was founded at UC Berkeley in the 1960s.  Even if the cancellation was justified by concerns about public safety after an outbreak of violence and property destruction, the fact that Yiannopoulos was prevented from speaking to a willing audience of campus Republicans should make supporters of free speech shiver. The article goes on to say that President Trump\u2019s threat to withdraw federal funds is a \u201c \u201d reaction, and accuses MILO of \u201cgeneralizing\u201d his critics\u2019 objections to his talks, but continues to condemn the opponents of free speech at Berkeley. Yet it\u2019s also true that, on colleges campuses and elsewhere, some \u201cprogressive\u201d voices do call for the stifling of speech they don\u2019t approve of. A leaflet circulated at the Berkeley protest said Yiannopoulos has \u201cno right to speak at Cal or anywhere else\u201d because he\u2019s a \u201ctool of Trump\u2019s possessive fascist government. \u201d This is just the latest variation on the   argument of the censor that \u201cerror has no rights,\u201d or, put another way, that one only has a right to free speech if one is speaking the \u201ctruth. \u201d It\u2019s an insidious notion that needs to be opposed in every generation.
