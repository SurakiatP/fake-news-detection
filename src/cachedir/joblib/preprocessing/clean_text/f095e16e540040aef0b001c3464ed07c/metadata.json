On Saturday, journalist Yashar Ali obtained an unedited video of Kelly\u2019s interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the   HuffPost and promptly eviscerated the \u201cnervous\u201d Kelly for asking Putin \u201csoftball\u201d questions. He wrote that the unedited footage \u201cshows a nervous Kelly who asked the authoritarian leader softball questions and failed to hold him accountable on key topics. \u201d \u201cMost troubling, Kelly devoted precious time in her short interview to a question that led one former CIA Russia analyst to say that it sounded as if Putin had written the question himself,\u201d he continues. According to the HuffPost piece, the \u201clast question Kelly asked Putin, which was not aired, was startling in its pandering. \u201d Kelly asks Putin in the unaired footage: We have been here in St. Petersburg for about a week now. And virtually every person we have met on the street says what they respect about you is they feel that you have returned dignity to Russia, that you\u2019ve returned Russia to a place of respect. You\u2019ve been in the leadership of this country for 17 years now. Has it taken any sort of personal toll on you? A former CIA Russia analyst told HuffPost that the Kremlin could use Kelly\u2019s interview for propaganda purposes: I can\u2019t begin to tell you what this did for Putin\u2019s ego, and I wouldn\u2019t put it past the Kremlin to use it for propaganda purposes. Putin\u2019s obsession is, by his definition, making Russia great again. He\u2019s obsessed with the idea that he has returned the country to what he sees as the glory days of the USSR. He feels that since the breakup of the USSR, Russia has too often ceded ground where it shouldn\u2019t have. And he\u2019s obsessed with people seeing him as the one who brought dignity back to Russia. According to the HuffPost piece, \u201cKelly\u2019s questions were so weak and she missed so many opportunities that several network news reporters asked HuffPost the unthinkable: \u2018Did NBC News, in their negotiations with the Kremlin, agree to terms and conditions on questions or topics? \u2019\u201d NBC sources reportedly confirmed that that there were no conditions, but the piece noted that \u201ca spokesman for NBC News declined to comment on Kelly\u2019s choice of questions. \u201d Though establishment media journalists patted Kelly on the head when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle, they mostly slammed Kelly for being way out of her league after Putin\u2019s interview. The Los Angeles Times noted that Kelly\u2019s   interview was \u201cchild\u2019s play\u201d for Putin, who \u201coutmaneuvered\u201d her \u201cas he displayed an elusive and ultimately dismissive demeanor toward Kelly. \u201d According to the Times, Kelly\u2019s   party delivered \u201cmore of a fizzle than a bang. \u201d \u201cThe interview, which was teased for weeks on NBC as a   exclusive, lasted less than 10 minutes,\u201d the Times continued. \u201cBut that was just about enough time to confirm that she\u2019s still not a great interviewer. \u201d Yahoo\u2019s Ken Tucker wrote that Putin\u2019s \u201ca load of nonsense\u201d comment could have described \u201cmost of the premiere of Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly. \u201d He added that Kelly was \u201cno match\u201d for Putin. On the day before Kelly\u2019s controversial interview with Alex Jones is set to air, HuffPost noted that \u201cmultiple sources at NBC News\u201d have wondered if network executives \u201cmisjudged Kelly\u2019s skill set, popularity and savvy as a reporter. \u201d A television executive reportedly told CNN that NBC\u2019s \u201cfundamental mistake\u201d was thinking that Kelly was a \u201csuperstar. \u201d The New York Times also doubted Kelly\u2019s ability to do a   interview with Jones, pointing out that \u201cNBC has not released a transcript of Ms. Kelly\u2019s interview, leading some to speculate that her interrogation of Mr. Jones over his more contentious views  \u2014   for instance, that Sandy Hook was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were carried out by the United States government  \u2014   was less than ferocious. \u201d Despite all of the hype, Kelly has failed to deliver ratings for NBC. The debut of Kelly\u2019s show could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes two weeks ago. Last Sunday, her second show tanked as well, losing to another rerun of 60 Minutes in addition to a rerun of America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos. After just two shows, NBC executives are already reportedly \u201cfreaking out\u201d over the \u201cratings disaster\u201d that is Kelly.'"}, "time": 1742562510.6202583}
