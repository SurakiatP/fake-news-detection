There is no case here. And they said it wasn\u2019t even a close call,\u2019 Clinton said. The staffer Clinton failed to name was Abedin, who has been at her side since Clinton was first lady. Clinton considers her like a surrogate daughter as well as longtime confidant. Abedin has been known for years to be Clinton\u2019s gatekeeper, and has been revealed in State Department emails as someone constantly consulted on matters relating to Bill Clinton, top donors, close friends, celebrities, who gets face time with the first lady, and paid speeches that pose potential conflicts. \u2018I\u2019m sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why it he world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go,\u2019 Clinton asked early in her remarks, before adding, \u2018That\u2019s a good question.\u2019 Clinton hammered the FBI over the weekend, after news broke Friday about the investigation. Since then, senior Democrats have taken up the cause. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid released a blistering letter where he wrote that FBI Director James Comey violating Hatch Act provisions on government employees interfering in an election. As she unloaded on the agency this time, Clinton also offered up words of contrition. \u2018For those of you who are concerned about using personal email, I understand,\u2019 she said. \u2018And as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m not making excuses. And I\u2019ve said it was a mistake and I regret\u2019 it, Clinton said. Then she turned to attack Donald Trump for having a \u2018hair-trigger temper\u2019 that could imperil the entire world.
