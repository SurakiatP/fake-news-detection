If so, we are at an excellent entry point for many silver stocks, which have been savagely beaten down over the past several months\u2014a necessary correction following their outsized run-up earlier in the year. \\nOn its one-year chart we can see that silver\u2019s corrective action from early July has brought it all the way back to its steadily rising 200-day moving average, a classic buy spot, where a potential intermediate base has formed. This corrective action has more than completely unwound the earlier overbought condition. \\nHowever, there are grounds for concern on two counts. One is that the steep drop early in October broke the price below the uptrend line shown, and the other is that the pattern that has since formed looks very much like a bear flag at first glance. If it is, another sharp drop will follow soon. \\nThus, it is interesting to observe that the volume pattern is not consistent with this being a bear flag. Instead, it is consistent with this being an intermediate base pattern. To properly examine the volume pattern in this sideways formation, we need to refer to a three-month chart, which opens it out sufficiently to see what is going on in detail. \\nBuy 2017 30 gram Gold Pandas and Buy 2017 Silver Panda Coins On Pre-Sale Now!

It looks like a bear flag until you look at the volume. Instead of a volume pattern consistent with a bear flag, which would feature greater downside volume days than upside volume, and a steady trend to lighter volume, we have the exact opposite over the past couple of weeks\u2014greater upside volume days and a trend of increasing volume. To steal a term from Infowars or Zero Hedge, this suggests a \u201cfalse flag\u201d that will lead to an upside breakout. \\nOn silver\u2019s seven-year chart we can see the 2011\u20132015 bear market in its entirety, and how breakout from the major downtrend channel led to a not-particularly impressive rally up to important resistance, where the advance stalled out and reaction set in. The relative feebleness of the rally following the breakout from the downtrend is not a cause for concern, as in the early stages of a bull market gold tends to outperform silver\u2014and it certainly didn\u2019t bother silver stocks any. Silver\u2019s next major upleg should take it above this resistance, albeit perhaps after something of a battle, and then on toward the next important resistance level in the $26\u201327 zone. \\nAlthough silver\u2019s long-term, 20-year chart presents a more messy picture than gold\u2019s 20-year chart, it does also show that the 2011 bear market may be viewed as a big correction to the major bull market advance from late 2001, as is the case with gold. Unlike gold\u2019s corrective bear market, which stopped at a major support level related to an extensive period of trading in 2008\u20132009, silver dropped down through its corresponding support level on its corrective bear market, and found support at a lower level related to an extensive period of trading in 2006\u20132007. All of this does mean that, so far, silver has been underperforming gold. \\nClive Maund has been president of www.clivemaund.com, a successful resource sector website, since its inception in 2003.
