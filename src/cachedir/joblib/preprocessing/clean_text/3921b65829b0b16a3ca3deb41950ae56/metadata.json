But this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s made sexual comments about Ivanka: \u201cIf I weren\u2019t happily married and, ya know, her father\u2026\u201d \\nThe latest tape shows the father and daughter duo appearing on an episode of the Wendy Williams Show back in 2013. During a segment called Fave 5, Wendy asked what their favorite thing to bond over was. \\nIvanka gave an eloquent response: \u201cEither real estate and golf.\u201d \\nHer father\u2019s, who is currently holding rallies in swing states while continuing to claim the election is rigged, had less to do with career and sports and more to do with his objectification of women: \u201cWell I was gonna say sex, but\u2026\u201d \\nThere\u2019s also a video from 1994 in which Trump sexualized his other daughter, Tiffany Trump , when she was a one-year-old. Tiffany is the only child between him and his second wife, Marla Maples . \u201cWell, I think that she\u2019s got a lot of Marla, she\u2019s a really beautiful baby, and she\u2019s got Marla\u2019s legs. We don\u2019t know yet if she\u2019s got this part yet.\u201d \\nAs he said that, Trump then held his hands to his chest and suggested breasts. That wasn\u2019t the only cringe-worthy moment pertaining to him and Tiffany, though. Donald Trump and Tiffany duck each other's kisses after presidential debate he refused to kiss Tiffany interesting https://t.co/CFrIs8xdL7 \\n\u2014 Rodney Giles (@jubileenetwork) October 13, 2016 \\nWatch the video of this disturbing exchange below : \\nFeatured Image: Screenshot Via YouTube Video .
