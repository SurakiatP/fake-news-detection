Trump. Now, because of comments by Mr. Trump and one of her brothers, she has been cast in perhaps an unfamiliar role: a central figure in a debate on social media about how a woman could  \u2014   or should  \u2014   respond to sexual harassment on the job. The issue came up in an interview Mr. Trump had with USA Today that was published on Monday. A columnist asked him about comments he had made on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC about the sexual harassment case that led to the ouster of the powerful Fox News chairman and chief executive Roger Ailes. Mr. Trump, who has himself faced strong criticism for his remarks about women  \u2014   including derogatory and sexually charged comments about their bodies  \u2014   said it was \u201csad\u201d that former Fox News employees were \u201ccomplaining\u201d about being sexually harassed, and he appeared to question the truthfulness of their accusations. When the columnist, Kirsten Powers, asked what would happen if Ivanka Trump faced similar treatment, he replied, \u201cI would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case. \u201d As criticism rolled in, Eric Trump attempted to defend his father\u2019s comments in an interview on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d on Tuesday, saying, \u201cI think what he\u2019s saying is, Ivanka is a strong, powerful woman she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to be\u201d subjected to such behavior. \u201cAnd, by the way,\u201d he added, \u201cyou should take it up with human resources, and I think she would as a strong person. \u201d The comments spurred a swift backlash, with women\u2019s advocates and others saying the suggestion that a woman who is being harassed  \u2014   even one from a wealthy family and one who is a businesswoman in her own right  \u2014   should leave her job was   misguided and unrealistic. Many also said that holding up Ms. Trump as a paragon of how powerful women can stave off harassment by simply being, well, powerful implied that other women allowed themselves to victimized. Terry O\u2019Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, called the comments \u201c . \u201d \u201cThe suggestion that she would just go get another career, that is a cavalier attitude that I think so many women I\u2019ve already heard from find deeply offensive because it ignores the reality of women\u2019s everyday lives,\u201d she said in a phone interview on Tuesday. Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host who has feuded with Ms. Trump\u2019s father, posted a   tweet that was widely shared: \u201cSigh. \u201d Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor who sued Mr. Ailes, accusing him of derailing her career after she refused his advances, also wrote on Twitter: \u201cSad in 2016 we\u2019re still victim blaming women. Trust me I\u2019m strong. \u201d In an emailed statement on Tuesday, Ms. Trump did not respond directly to the comments of her brother or father, but said: \u201cHarassment in general, sexual or otherwise, is inexcusable. At our companies, we do not tolerate harassment of any kind. Our policies both on paper and in practice require that every complaint be fully investigated and if claims are substantiated, our H. R. team takes swift disciplinary action. \u201d Fatima Goss Graves, the senior vice president at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said harassment was one of the ways women were pushed out of some sectors like the tech industry. The E. E. O. C. received almost 7, 000 charges of sexual harassment last year, according to its website. Many cases go unreported. \u201cEmployees who do experience harassment often don\u2019t report it because they fear retaliation, they fear professional or social penalties, they worry that they will be blamed for the harassment,\u201d Ms. Graves said. \u201cThere are social and emotional costs there are longstanding career costs. \u201d \u201cHarassment isn\u2019t about someone being weak or strong or asking to be harassed,\u201d she added. \u201cIf it was as simple as being a stronger person, it would probably be an easier problem to solve. \u201d Eric Trump appeared to try to stem the criticism later on Tuesday. He retweeted Amanda Carpenter, a conservative commentator and former aide to Senator Ted Cruz, who also sought the Republican presidential nomination. She wrote: \u201cStrong women may flee sexual harassment. Strong women may also fight, endure, and one day gain power to protect other women. \u201d \u201cI think this is well said,\u201d he posted. Ms. Trump whose role in her father\u2019s campaign has traditionally been filled by a candidate\u2019s wife, has been called \u201chis secret weapon. \u201d At the Republican National Convention, she spoke about parental leave, equal pay and the role of women in the Trump Organization. The persona she has created is of a model of American femininity  \u2014   stylish and poised, but also successful in business, said Michael Bronski, a professor of women\u2019s studies at Harvard. On Ms. Trump\u2019s website, #womenwhowork, there are posts on negotiating flexible hours and avoiding \u201cdrama at the office. \u201d But her 2010 book, \u201cThe Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life,\u201d shows that even she was not immune to the issue of workplace harassment. Ms. Trump recounted being whistled at by workers at her father\u2019s construction projects. But once they realized she was the boss\u2019s daughter, she said, they were apologetic. It had a big impact on her when she started her first job years later, at the development company Forest City Ratner. She wrote that she had recurring nightmares about being catcalled on a job site in the weeks before she started. She fretted over how she would react in front of her new boss. She didn\u2019t want to come across as either weak, or a \u201ctightly wound witch,\u201d she said. \u201dI couldn\u2019t shake thinking that I needed to come up with a disarming line to defuse the situation and keep the embarrassment level to a minimum,\u201d Ms. Trump wrote. When she did eventually encounter catcalls, she wrote that she was able to deflect them \u201cwith relative ease. \u201d She says that sexual harassment is never acceptable, but that one should \u201clearn how to figure out when a hoot or a holler is indeed a form of harassment and when it\u2019s merely a   tease that you can give back in kind. \u201d \u201cSometimes it might be tough to tell the difference, I realize, and in that case you should do whatever feels right and comfortable. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561789.511711}
