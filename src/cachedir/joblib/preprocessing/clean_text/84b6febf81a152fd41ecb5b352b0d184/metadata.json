In a new video released by Project Veritas Action, a PVA journalist exposes how his pay for play with Robert Creamer landed him a meeting with Bradley Beychock, the President of Media Matters For America, an organization that has been attacking James O\u2019Keefe for years.\\nBradley Beychock is first seen in the undercover video bragging how he is responsible for taking knowable conservative voices off TV stations with pressure campaigns: \u201cLou Dobbs from CNN left now and he is on FOX Business, Glenn Beck off of FOX News.\u201d So it seems that there is simply no tolerance and no room left for conservatism in the media, yet they claim the system isn\u2019t rigged? Of course its rigged!\\nDuring the meeting, Beychock gave the PVA journalist a tour of their offices. He also proudly boasted about the Media Matters assault on conservative writer and political consultant Roger Stone.\\n\u201cSo I think for Trump, our big role as a media watchdog has been to take his MVPs and put them on the sidelines. So the first one was Roger Stone,\u201d said Beychock.\\nJames O\u2019Keefe interviewed Stone and showed him the footage, to which Stone responded.\\nShortly after James O\u2019Keefe and Roger Stone were interviewed together on Alex Jones\u2019s show, Media Matters put up the Alex Jones interview on their website.\\nMedia Matters is funded by Clinton confidante George Soros.\\nProject Veritas Action Fund (AKA Project Veritas Action) was founded by James O\u2019Keefe to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628378.8211358}
