Trump \u201cno\u201d and not be \u201ca mere rubber stamp. \u201d \u25a0 He said that waterboarding is \u201cabsolutely\u201d illegal and that he did not support barring Muslims from the United States. \u25a0 Because of comments he made during the presidential campaign, Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself from any lingering investigations involving Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails or her family\u2019s foundation. \u25a0 Retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security nominee, said that a wall on the border with Mexico would not by itself remedy illegal immigration. Here\u2019s the latest: Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, questioned Mr. Sessions about his links to groups and people who have taken xenophobic views. Here\u2019s a quick primer, from a recent Times profile. Mr. Blumenthal asked: \u201cHow can Americans have confidence that you\u2019re going to enforce   laws if you\u2019ve accepted awards from these kinds of groups and associated with these kinds of individuals and won\u2019t return the awards?\u201d Mr. Sessions said he does not necessarily share the views of every political donor or organization he has received an award from. Mr. Sessions came of age in the Justice Department at the height of the crack epidemic. He has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs, said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d when President Obama compared marijuana to alcohol, and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like Colorado that have legalized marijuana. He said in 2015: Flash forward to Tuesday. Mr. Sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would put the weight of the Justice Department behind drug prosecution in those states. Doing so would set up a huge fight over states\u2019 rights and federal drug policy. \u201cI know it won\u2019t be an easy decision,\u201d he said. Senate Democrats do not have the votes, by themselves, to prevent Mr. Sessions from becoming attorney general, and they have spared their colleague any vitriol, doing little to undermine his confirmation. Mr. Sessions was prepared to face renewed questions about race and comments he was accused of making  in the 1980s regarding the N. A. A. C. P. the American Civil Liberties Union and \u201c \u201d views. Liberal activists have repeatedly disrupted the hearing, screaming \u201cK. K. K. \u201d or \u201cracist. \u201d But the questioning from Democrats has mostly focused on his Senate record and whether he would enforce laws that he disagreed with. He has said he would. In short, there is no indication so far that his confirmation is in jeopardy. Mr. Sessions, who has supported the use of waterboarding as an interrogation tactic, said that current law makes it \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal. \u201d That\u2019s important because it suggests that Mr. Sessions sees no workaround that would allow Mr. Trump to reinstate such tactics. Mr. Sessions has previously said he supported the Justice Department legal analysis that authorized harsh interrogation in C. I. A. prisons, and has said that waterboarding works. By saying that the law against waterboarding is clear, Mr. Sessions makes it much harder, if not impossible, for Mr. Trump to bring it back. In response to a question about whether he supported a temporary ban on Muslim immigration, as Mr. Trump has suggested, Mr. Sessions said he did not. \u201cI have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious groups should be denied admission to the United States,\u201d he said. But he noted that Mr. Trump has since clarified that the restriction should be on immigration from countries that support terrorism. He said religious views  \u2014   where, for example, they include justification for violence against Americans  \u2014   should be considered as part of the visa progress. Would you support a law that says, \u2018You can\u2019t come to America because you\u2019re a Muslim\u2019? asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Sessions replied. Mr. Sessions was a top surrogate for Mr. Trump during a campaign in which \u201clock her up!\u201d was a rallying cry against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sessions said that if there were lingering investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server or her family foundation, he would recuse himself. \u201cYou intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton email matter and any investigation involving the Clinton foundation, if there are any?\u201d asked Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThis country doesn\u2019t punish its political enemies. \u201d Mr. Sessions last faced the Judiciary Committee three decades ago, for a seat on the federal bench. His nomination failed, in part over allegations that he had described civil rights groups as \u201c \u201d and that he had suggested a white lawyer was a disgrace to his race for representing  . At the time, he said his comments were misunderstood or taken out of context. He offered a more forceful denial this time: \u201cI never declared that the N. A. A. C. P. was \u2018 \u2019 or that a civil rights attorney was a \u2018disgrace to his race,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sessions said. In 1986 he described it this way: And here\u2019s how he described the \u201cdisgrace to his race\u201d exchange. Mr. Sessions assured his Senate colleagues that he would strictly adhere to the Constitution and stand up to the president if needed. He\u2019s been consistent for years that senators should apply that test to Justice Department nominees. The Republican theme of the hearing is that Mr. Sessions is a known entity, and he reinforced that in his opening remarks. \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I believe in. \u201d Mr. Sessions has been in the Senate for nearly 20 years and is liked by his colleagues. Moderate Republicans and at least one Democrat have said they will vote for him, which all but guarantees his confirmation. And General Kelly is likely to be easily confirmed. That does not mean Democrats will hold their fire, but they are likely to mount their most vigorous offensive against other nominees, including Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican who is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be health secretary. While Mr. Sessions faced some tough questioning, the early going for General Kelly was more gentle. Mr. Gates, a former defense secretary under Mr. Obama and George W. Bush, introduced General Kelly as a \u201c  candid, courageous leader who will say exactly what he thinks. \u201d But what sets him apart, Mr. Gates said, is his character. \u201cTo put it quite simply, he is one of the finest people I have ever known,\u201d he said. \u201cI would trust him with my life. \u201d Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, asked Mr. Kelly to be ready to take tough questions, but thanked him for providing the disclosures necessary by the Office of Government Ethics, whose review was completed this week. She asked Mr. Kelly to hew closely to what he had described as his greatest strength: speaking truth to power. \u201cThat was music to my ears,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said. \u201cI believe very much in that principle, and I think we all anticipate that you will need it in your next job. \u201d \u201cGiven your experience, I expect you to be up to that challenge,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think if you\u2019re backing down, you\u2019ll probably hear from me. \u201d In response to questions from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the southern border, General Kelly said a physical barrier wasn\u2019t going to stem the problem. \u201cIf you were to build a wall from the Pacific to Mexico, you would still have to have it backed up by people, by sensors, by other technologies,\u201d he said. The Kelly hearing was remarkable for its subdued tone, with Republicans and Democrats alike cordially asking Mr. Kelly about Mr. Trump\u2019s more contentious stances, like forcing Muslims to register with the federal government. One by one, he put their concerns to rest in a measured tone. It apparently proved too subdued for the protest group Code Pink. A couple of activists listened in their bright pink capes mere hours after disrupting the confirmation hearing for Mr. Sessions. More than an hour after the hearing started, they quietly collected their belongings and left the hearing room without any demonstration.'"}, "time": 1742628447.7922688}
