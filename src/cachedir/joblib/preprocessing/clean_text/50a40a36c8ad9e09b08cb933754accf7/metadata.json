Instead, she discovered Mend, an app and online community that serves as part personal trainer, part online refuge for the brokenhearted. On the Mend app, users are introduced to an animated avatar of the Mend founder, Ellen Huerta, and her reassuring voice offers guidance on how to move forward, with topics like \u201cdetoxing\u201d from your ex redefining your sense of self  \u2014   even how to get a better night\u2019s sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s this charming and endearing voice of a friend,\u201d Ms. Scinto said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a line, \u2018We never get tired of hearing about your breakup,\u2019 and those words are like an oasis in the desert. \u201d Geri Dugan, who works as a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Chicago, knows all too well the mixed emotions that come after a love affair ends. After being stunned by a relationship that didn\u2019t work out, she said, she felt like an \u201cemotional basket case. \u201d Ms. Dugan found Mend through Ms. Huerta\u2019s podcast \u201cLove Is Like a Plant. \u201d Now, for more than eight months, she has been applying Mend\u2019s daily regime, which includes monitoring one\u2019s   journaling exercises, a Spotify playlist and a book club on Good Reads. She has also navigated through difficult days with support from Mend\u2019s Facebook group. It \u201creally helped normalize the experience,\u201d Ms. Dugan said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m even recommending it to some of my patients going through things like divorce. \u201d In her Santa Monica, Calif. office, just blocks from the Pacific, Ms. Huerta, 30, with a tumble of dark hair and giant blue eyes, admitted that she had always been drawn to matters of the heart. \u201cMend started very organically after I went through a breakup,\u201d she said between sips of her   rooibos tea. \u201cI had a lot of resources at my disposal  \u2014   I had supportive friends and access to therapy  \u2014   but I still was having such a hard time moving forward. \u201d Ms. Huerta, identified by the name Elle on Mend, found online sites that offer breakup advice to be disappointing, with generic insights like \u201cIt just takes time\u201d or wearisome directives like \u201cPost a photo on social media of yourself with someone new. \u201d She said she set out to build a better digital experience for the newly solo, where users could shake their feeling of helplessness and take action. As a former Google employee, she was familiar with the tech field and took her cues from fitness and   apps. \u201cWe are taking those parts of our lives very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cYet we weren\u2019t doing that with our love lives, which is at the core of who we are. \u201d Mend started as a newsletter focused on recovering from heartbreak. Now the company is working with Silicon Beach\u2019s highly selective business accelerator MuckerLab (whose portfolio includes tech companies like TaskRabbit and the Black Tux). MuckerLab invested seed money in Mend and assists Ms. Huerta with business development, including product design and marketing. Still less than a year old, the app has been downloaded in more than 100 countries, and many Mend users return for the supportive community, which spills over with tales of solidarity. \u201cOne of my personal missions is to erase the shame and taboo of heartbreak as something to just get over,\u201d Ms. Huerta said. One way she addresses that is by drawing on her background in science. (She has a degree in geosciences from Wellesley, and her father is a geophysicist.) She counsels the Mend community that it\u2019s not just emotion that causes a wave of intense feelings, it\u2019s also biology. \u201cIt\u2019s different for everyone,\u201d Ms. Huerta said, \u201cbut when you go through a separation with someone who you have been intimate with, your body can tell that there\u2019s been a separation. You\u2019re giving off hormones, and they are giving off hormones, over time you become addicted to that source of   hormones. \u201d She pointed to a 2016 study published in the Frontiers in Psychology journal, in which researchers found that romantic love stimulates the same area of the brain as addiction does, with symptoms like euphoria, craving and emotional and physical dependence. Love\u2019s addictionlike qualities, the study states, have developed in humans to encourage procreation and, thus, our very existence. Although much of Ms. Huerta\u2019s advice for Mend users is grounded either in science or in her own romantic mistrials, and she encourages a range of options, like meditation and   teas, she firmly believes in the magic and mystery of love, which no data, chart or study can pinpoint. It is that belief that will inform a Mend app update scheduled to roll out in the spring. One sentiment remains: \u201cIt\u2019s true what they say,\u201d Ms. Huerta said. \u201cLove really is the drug. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562553.9874544}
