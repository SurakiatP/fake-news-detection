And now, after a ruling from European regulators on Wednesday, all three efforts have failed. The $30 billion merger, announced more than a year ago, would have created Europe\u2019s largest stock market operator by far, leaving the combined company better positioned to compete with American rivals. But the deal faced a number of questions, particularly after German regulators and politicians balked at the combined exchange having its headquarters in London even as Britain moves forward with plans to leave the European Union. On Wednesday, the European Commission officially blocked the deal, with Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner, citing concerns that a merger would create a \u201cde facto monopoly\u201d in the clearing of bonds and   products. \u201cAs the parties failed to offer the remedies required to address our competition concerns, the Commission has decided to prohibit the merger,\u201d she said. The rejection came on the day that Britain began the   negotiating process to withdraw from the   bloc. While the shape of Britain\u2019s eventual trading relationship with the European Union following the   Brexit remains unclear, one thing is certain: The European authorities will maintain jurisdiction over many big mergers, even when they involve companies with headquarters outside the European Union. But as Britain leaves the bloc making such deals may become even thornier. British companies like the London Stock Exchange will probably be perceived differently, seen instead as overseas buyers. \u201cWe deal with any company who has a footprint in the European market because we want competition in the European market no matter your flag, no matter your ownership, and that goes for everyone,\u201d Ms. Vestager told a news conference. Though the decision by European regulators ended a monthslong effort to combine the two operators, the announcement itself was widely anticipated. Last month, the London exchange said that the deal was unlikely to be approved after European regulators  \u2014   who had opened an investigation in September  \u2014   unexpectedly added a condition that it sell a majority stake in MTS, an electronic platform for trading European government bonds and other fixed income products. The London Stock Exchange called the remedy \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d arguing that any such sale would set off additional regulatory processes in Europe and the United States, and would be detrimental to its businesses in Italy, where it operates the Borsa Italiana. On Wednesday, it said it \u201cregrets\u201d the Commission\u2019s decision to block the merger, but was confident in its prospects as a   business. The chairman of Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s supervisory board, Joachim Faber, meanwhile, said the decision was \u201ca setback for Europe. \u201d \u201cA rare opportunity to create a global market infrastructure provider based in Europe and to strengthen the global competitiveness of Europe\u2019s financial markets has been missed,\u201d he said in a news release. German regulators and lawmakers had also become increasingly concerned in recent months about the combined company having its headquarters in London after last year\u2019s referendum in Britain on European Union membership. They have pushed for the headquarters to be in Frankfurt. Prosecutors in Germany had also opened an inquiry into the timing of the purchase of Deutsche B\u00f6rse shares by Carsten Kengeter, the Deutsche B\u00f6rse chief executive who was set to head the combined company. The shares were purchased months before the exchanges announced their merger, but investigators are looking into whether they were secretly in talks at the time of the share purchase. Mr. Faber, has said the accusations have no basis, and Mr. Kengeter has called them \u201cunfounded. \u201d Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the London Stock Exchange had hoped to create a potential European champion by combining stock exchanges in Britain, Germany and Italy, as well as several of Europe\u2019s largest clearinghouses. That would have helped the combined company compete with United States rivals like the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and CME Group, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange. In seeking approval for the deal, the London Stock Exchange Group agreed in January to sell LCH, the French operating arm of the LCH. Clearnet Group, after saying it was seeking to \u201caddress proactively antitrust concerns raised by the European Commission. \u201d The sale was contingent on the approval by European regulators of the Deutsche   Stock Exchange transaction. But the European Commission did not find that to be convincing, saying it would have created an effective monopoly in the clearing of bonds and other fixed income products in Europe. The commission also found that the merger would have removed   horizontal competition for the clearing of   equity derivatives. Regulators found that the parties proposed remedy of selling LCH would have addressed only its concerns about   equity derivatives, but not its unease about fixed income clearing. The Intercontinental Exchange had been seen as a potential rival in the deal for the London Stock Exchange, but it opted in May not to pursue an acquisition. The rejection of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger, however, now raises questions about whether the Intercontinental Exchange would take another look at the London exchange. \u201cA weakened L. S. E. may need to look west for a future partner and strategy,\u201d said John Colley, the associate dean of Warwick Business School at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England. Mr. Colley said that while the London Stock Exchange\u2019s business was performing well, \u201cthere is very likely to be some fallout from Brexit. \u201d The Intercontinental Exchange was one potential bidder, he said, particularly given the weakness of the British pound against the dollar and the reduced cost of borrowing in an environment of historically low interest rates. \u201cThe L. S. E. is now vulnerable to a bid,\u201d he said. Deutsche B\u00f6rse, however, does not have many potential targets for mergers in Europe, and will probably try to attract stock listings and trading from Britain following Brexit, Mr. Colley said.'"}, "time": 1742628567.1374102}
