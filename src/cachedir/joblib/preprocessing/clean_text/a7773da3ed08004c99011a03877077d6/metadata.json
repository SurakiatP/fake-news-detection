Trump for president on Thursday in a modest but unequivocal backing of a candidate whose views Mr. Ryan has frequently condemned. In a column in his hometown newspaper in Janesville, Wis. Mr. Ryan said that recent conversations with Mr. Trump had convinced him that the billionaire developer will help advance the conservative agenda that the speaker is trying to introduce. \u201cThrough these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, who is also chairman of the Republican National Convention that will nominate Mr. Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll be voting for him this fall. \u201d The endorsement is the latest and most consequential example of leading Republicans falling in line behind Mr. Trump. Mr. Ryan faced substantial pressure from fellow Republicans in Congress, many of whom share Mr. Ryan\u2019s misgivings about Mr. Trump, because they realize that   public divisiveness over his candidacy only weakens Mr. Trump and increases the political risks of defending their majorities in the House and Senate. \u201cI think it was always going to be this way,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said. \u201cIt was never plausible that a speaker would preside over your convention and not endorse you. \u201d Mr. Cole said the decision to endorse Mr. Trump would bolster Mr. Ryan\u2019s main priority of protecting Republican seats in the House. \u201cThere is just no way that could have been helped by having that division,\u201d he said. After a sometimes awkward courtship, Mr. Trump said he was happy that Mr. Ryan had finally backed him. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview. \u201cI have a good relationship with him, actually. He was taken a little bit by storm because my situation was supposed to go to the convention. \u201d In an announcement that came while lawmakers were still scattered across the country for their weeklong Memorial Day recess, Mr. Ryan explained Thursday that he had withheld his support until he could discuss his policy priorities with Mr. Trump. But the speaker, who repeatedly dismissed rumors that he was considering his own presidential run this year and is already considered a contender in 2020, said he would not hesitate to disagree with Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that he and I have our differences,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in the column he submitted to The Gazette in Janesville. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I\u2019ll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. \u201d Mr. Ryan\u2019s endorsement puts him at odds with Mitt Romney, who selected Mr. Ryan as his running mate in 2012. Mr. Romney delivered a scathing condemnation of Mr. Trump several months ago and has encouraged a   challenger to enter the race. The fact that Mr. Ryan saved his endorsement for a written column precluded, for the moment, a public show of the two men coming together, and there were no plans announced for any joint appearances. Mr. Ryan is expected to focus mainly on campaigning for House candidates in the late summer and fall. An official with knowledge of the Ryan deliberations, who did not want to be identified discussing internal strategy, said the decision to proceed with the endorsement was made this week by Mr. Ryan personally. The   elected Republican, Mr. Ryan shook up the presidential race in May when he said he was not ready to endorse Mr. Trump. Mr. Ryan had been highly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country, saying the pledge was anathema to conservative principles and \u201cnot what this country stands for. \u201d The two have spoken numerous times, Mr. Ryan wrote in the column. Last month they sat down for a   meeting in Washington, emerging to say they had laid the groundwork for reconciliation. The men spoke again by phone last week. But it was clear that there was still some distance between them. With more Republican lawmakers coming around to endorse Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan had stayed silent on when, or if, he would join them. Representative Chris Collins, the New York Republican who was the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump, said Mr. Ryan\u2019s announcement signaled the party\u2019s growing unity. \u201cSpeaker Ryan\u2019s endorsement today reinforces the fact that Republicans are united in our fight to defeat Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said in a statement. Mr. Ryan\u2019s support will also make for a much smoother convention for both Mr. Trump and the speaker. Discussion about Mr. Trump was also overshadowing the activities of House Republicans, with Mr. Ryan facing constant questions about his talks with Mr. Trump. Mr. Ryan is hoping to shift the focus to a rollout of a conservative policy agenda when the House returns next week. The decision by Mr. Ryan also closes a divide with his counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, who has been openly supporting Mr. Trump, citing the need to have a Republican president to fill Supreme Court vacancies. Some conservatives seemed sympathetic to Mr. Ryan\u2019s position, if not convinced by his arguments. Tim Miller, who served as communications director for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, said Mr. Ryan had \u201chandled a tough situation about as well as he could. \u201d \u201cBut let\u2019s not try to sell this farce that Trump will support House agenda,\u201d Mr. Miller posted on Twitter. \u201cAbsurd,\u201d he wrote. Word of the endorsement came just as Mr. Trump\u2019s likely rival in November, Hillary Clinton, was delivering a blistering attack on his foreign policy positions, warning against giving the country\u2019s nuclear codes to the Manhattan businessman. Mr. Ryan criticized her in his column, writing: \u201cA Clinton White House would mean four more years of liberal cronyism and a government more out for itself than the people it serves. Quite simply, she represents all that our agenda aims to fix. \u201d Democrats pounced on the latest opportunity to tie Mr. Trump to Republicans, including vulnerable lawmakers fighting for  . Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said the Republican Party is now \u201cthe party of Trump. \u201d \u201cSpeaker Ryan\u2019s abject surrender makes it official,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe GOP is Trump\u2019s party now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563404.8309665}
