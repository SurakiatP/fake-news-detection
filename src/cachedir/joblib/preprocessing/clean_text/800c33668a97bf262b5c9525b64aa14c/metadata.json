In the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the student, Yordy Aragonez, claims that the officer used unreasonable force when breaking up a fight at Progress High School in the East Williamsburg section on Dec. 21, 2015. The suit was reported by NY1. The police said that officers responded that day to reports of several large fights at the school. Mr. Aragonez claims in his suit that he was pulled into a fight because he and his cousin were defending themselves after being \u201caggressively confronted and set upon by a group of male students. \u201d Then, the suit says, Mr. Aragonez was grabbed by the officer and pushed into a room where a class was in session. A video taken by a student and broadcast by NY1 showed the officer, named in the suit as Kareem Phillips, yelling at Mr. Aragonez, knocking him to the ground and into a desk and hitting him with the baton. \u201cAs officers attempted to break up the altercation, an officer used a baton,\u201d the Police Department said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cAs a matter of practice, the incident is under review by the Internal Affairs Bureau. \u201d Mr. Aragonez was not immediately available for comment on Saturday, but in an interview with NY1, he said he had not resisted. \u201cHe was just hitting me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even trying to get up or nothing. \u201d The Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, the union that represents New York police officers, said it was not clear whether the officer could have handled the episode differently. \u201cA snippet of video of a chaotic situation never tells the entire story,\u201d Patrick J. Lynch, the association\u2019s president, said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cThere is an investigation underway, and until all the facts are gathered, we must all withhold judgment. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561793.0447562}
