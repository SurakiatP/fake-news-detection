CNN\u2019s CAROL COSTELLO: \u201cSo let\u2019s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?\u201d JONATHAN GRUBER: \u201cLook, once again, there\u2019s no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty\u201c\u2026 Gruber\u2019s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. \u201cObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,\u201d points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool \u201cstupid\u201d Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law\u2019s \u201clack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage\u201d in selling it.'"}, "time": 1742563363.1383262}
