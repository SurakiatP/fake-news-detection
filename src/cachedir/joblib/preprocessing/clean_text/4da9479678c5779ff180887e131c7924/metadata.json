Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. who drove the police transport van in which Mr. Gray suffered the spinal cord injury that killed him, faced the most serious charges of any of the six officers indicted in the fatal arrest. His acquittal on seven counts leaves the state without any convictions after three trials, in one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched police misconduct cases  \u2014   and continues to leave open the question of what, exactly, happened to Mr. Gray inside the van. Judge Barry G. Williams, who presided over the Goodson trial, issued the verdicts to a hushed, packed courtroom. He drew no conclusions about exactly when during the van ride Mr. Gray got hurt, saying there were several \u201cequally plausible scenarios. \u201d And he rejected the state\u2019s contention that the officer had given Mr. Gray an intentional \u201crough ride\u201d and knowingly endangered him by failing to buckle him into the van or provide medical help. Mr. Gray was detained after fleeing, apparently unprompted, from officers in the downtrodden Sandtown neighborhood of West Baltimore, and loaded into a police wagon that made six stops in West Baltimore before it arrived at the Western District police station, where Mr. Gray was found unresponsive and not breathing, with a devastating spinal cord injury. The death of Mr. Gray, a    black man, set off a wave of violent unrest here last year and thrust this majority black city into the center of a wrenching national debate over race and policing. The state\u2019s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, sought to quell the violence by telling protesters she heard their \u201ccall for \u2018no justice, no peace,\u2019\u201d promising to deliver \u201cjustice on behalf of this young man. \u201d But the first trial, of Officer William Porter, ended with a hung jury in December he is scheduled to be retried. A second officer, Edward M. Nero, was acquitted last month of four charges. Thursday\u2019s verdicts instantly reignited debate here over whether Ms. Mosby had overcharged the officers and prompted speculation about what she will do next. \u201cThis was the state\u2019s Waterloo,\u201d declared Warren Brown, a defense lawyer who has been watching the trials, and has been sharply critical of the prosecution. Mayor Stephanie   issued a bland statement after the verdict that said, in part, \u201cI know the citizens of Baltimore will continue to respect the judicial process and the ruling of the court. \u201d The Baltimore police union called immediately for all remaining charges to be dropped and accused Ms. Mosby of \u201cplaying politics with our agency. \u201d Ms. Mosby had no comment like all parties in the case, she is bound by a judge\u2019s order barring her from talking about it. But most legal experts agreed that Ms. Mosby must now rethink her strategy. Still, the road ahead is a complicated one for her. Several officers charged in the cases have filed defamation suits against her a decision to drop criminal charges against them could become fodder for their lawsuits  \u2014   and hurt her if she seeks  . \u201cIf she abandons the prosecution of the four remaining trials, the only interpretation of that is that she has been defeated  \u2014   certainly that does not bode well politically for her,\u201d said Warren Alperstein, a lawyer who represents police officers, though not those charged in the Gray cases. \u201cOn the other hand, how far do you take this when you are oh for three?\u201d One calculation, if she does go forward, is whether to seek the removal of Judge Williams from future trials. The judge, a former federal prosecutor who tried police misconduct cases for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, has presided over all three trials so far. The first trial was a jury trial the other two were tried by the judge, at the request of the officers. In the process, though, he has tipped his hand as to his thinking about some of the other defendants. For instance, he said on Thursday that it \u201cstrains credibility\u201d to think that Officer Porter, who testified that he did not believe that Mr. Gray was in medical distress, had told Officer Goodson that Mr. Gray was in danger. And during the trial of Officer Nero, one of the two arresting officers, the judge raised the idea that the other officer  \u2014   Garrett E. Miller  \u2014   had been more deeply involved in the arrest. Officer Miller faces trial starting on July 27. The courtroom was tense and quiet as the judge read the verdicts on Thursday sheriff\u2019s deputies had issued a warning: \u201cno moans, no groans. \u201d Afterward, Officer Goodson hugged members of his family and Officers Nero and Miller, both of whom were seated in the front row. Ms. Mosby heaved a sigh and walked out, her head down, escorted by her security guard. Jan Bledsoe and Michael Schatzow, who prosecuted the case, followed,   and looking glum. Outside the courthouse, a small band of protesters gathered, maybe a few dozen in all. Many had expected the verdict some sounded more resigned, others angry. \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual  \u2014   you\u2019re not going to convict nobody for killing a black man in America, whether it be New York or Chicago, Philadelphia or Baltimore,\u201d said Duane \u201cShorty\u201d Davis, a chef and activist here. \u201cBlack lives don\u2019t matter to white America. \u201d Mr. Davis said he believed Ms. Mosby never had any \u201cintention of winning this case,\u201d and that the only reason she brought charges \u201cis because they had an uprising. \u201d Others said they saw the $6. 4 million settlement that Baltimore paid to Mr. Gray\u2019s family, including his mother, to settle an expected civil suit last year as a kind of payback, or trade, for the acquittals. Among them were George Grady and his girlfriend, Carleen White, near Pennsylvania and North Avenues, not far from the site of last year\u2019s unrest. \u201cWhen she took the money, why would you find the police guilty now?\u201d Mr. Grady said. As to whether Ms. Mosby should drop the remaining cases, he said was of two minds. At first, he said she should not. But then, he switched gears: \u201cThe family got paid. Let it go, let this rest. \u201d Despite the sense here that little has changed since then, some civil rights leaders, like Tessa   the president of Baltimore\u2019s branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said the very act of trying the officers has brought scrutiny to police practices that had long endured in the shadows. And some police practices appear to be changing. \u201cWe\u2019re here, and the police are being looked at, and they have to change their behavior,\u201d Ms.   said, adding that she hoped the prosecutions would continue for that reason. \u201cAs a person out in the street, I think we should keep them coming. \u201d Late last month, the Baltimore police announced they were putting new cameras in transport vans. Ms.   as well as a lawyer, A. Dwight Petit, who represents police brutality plaintiffs in Baltimore, say anecdotal complaints of rough rides have dropped since Mr. Gray\u2019s case took over the headlines. That has trickled down to anecdotes on the street. Standing at the intersection of Pennsylvania and North Avenues, Darrius Colbert, 26, who said that he had served about seven years in prison, said he had been arrested and loaded into a police wagon on three occasions  \u2014   twice before Mr. Gray\u2019s death, and once after. On the former occasions, Mr. Colbert said, he was not secured with a seatbelt, and felt \u201cweak and powerless,\u201d though he was not hurt. \u201cThe van takes off,\u201d he said, \u201cyou just slide around, thinking, \u2018I have no control over my life whatsoever. \u2019\u201d But during his most recent arrest, he said that he was buckled in.'"}, "time": 1742564135.9147084}
