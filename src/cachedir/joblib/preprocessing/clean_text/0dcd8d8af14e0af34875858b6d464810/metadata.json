[Under the banner of the Balkan Frontier Defence Project, the countries will ensure that their police and military forces are in constant contact to ensure the vigilant protection of the national borders northwards of Greece, and repelling illegal immigrants from those borders.  Austrian Defence Minister   Doskozil (SP\u00d6) told Die Welt: \u201cWe do not believe that the EU\u2019s external borders are adequately protected so far by the EU. That is why Austria, together with 15 other countries along the Balkan route and the Visegr\u00e1d states, is planning a close cooperation in the framework of a new Balkan frontier defence project. \u201cIf there is a mass influx of migrants, the states involved in the border protection initiative want to be able to act quickly. In the event of a crisis, we will work towards a common situation using clearly defined contacts and a regular exchange of information between the police and military heads of the countries involved. \u201d To strengthen Austria\u2019s capacity to respond, the minister is also working on a change in the law which would allow the country to send troops abroad. Currently, Austrian troops can only be dispatched for humanitarian missions, but he said the government would like to widen their scope. \u201cAustria is ready to offer countries both inside and outside the EU, not only for humanitarian reasons but also for the protection of their borders, if these countries ask us to do so and we have sufficient capacities,\u201d he said. The moves are being made, Doskozil said, because the amount of illegal smuggling taking place in the Balkans and the number of migrants are both still \u201csignificant\u201d. At present, between 500 and 1, 000 migrants are arriving in Austria each week, but the minister said the situation could deteriorate rapidly at any time thanks to the fragile nature of the EU\u2019s deal with Turkey. \u201cWe must intensely prepare now for the [Turkish] government\u2019s reopening of the sluices in Ankara, which President Erdo\u011fan has already threatened several times to do,\u201d Doskozil said, adding: \u201cErdo\u011fan is not a reliable partner of the EU. \u201d He went on to criticise the current number of illegal migrants in the EU as \u201ctoo high\u201d calling for much more to be done to bring down their numbers. \u201cReturn centres, higher penalties for asylum seekers who violate the rules, and massive cuts in illegal immigrants\u2019 money would all be appropriate means,\u201d he suggested, calling for an \u201cEU repatriation summit\u201d to be convened to discuss   action across Europe. \u201cThe previous initiatives, such as the stronger role for Frontex in repatriation, are far from sufficient,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be best to have a European repatriation officer of rank and name, who could take on this important issue. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561758.9088168}
