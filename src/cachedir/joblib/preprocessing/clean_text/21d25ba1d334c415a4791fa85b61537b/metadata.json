Trump\u2019s inauguration. Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra, Louise Lawler, Joan Jonas and Julie Mehretu were among the art stars signing the invitation for a \u201cJ20 Art Strike,\u201d which urges museums, galleries, concert halls, art schools and nonprofit institutions to close to protest \u201cthe normalization of Trumpism,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cIt is not a strike against art, theater or any other cultural form. It is an invitation to motivate these activities anew, to reimagine these spaces as places where resistant forms of thinking, seeing, feeling and acting can be produced. \u201d Ms. Jonas, who represented the United States at the 2015 Venice Biennale, said in an interview that she hoped people would attend protests on Jan. 20. \u201cI\u2019m interested in action and protest and people expressing their feelings about this situation that we\u2019re in,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about minorities, immigrants, corruption and security. \u201d Cultural institutions around the country are still mulling their moves, with some, including the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1 and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma) pledging to maintain their regular hours that day. \u201cOur entire program and mission, every day, is an expression of inclusion and appreciation of every culture,\u201d Miranda Carroll, Lacma\u2019s director of communications, wrote in an email. The Whitney Museum will also remain open, but will implement     admission for the day, hoping to encourage discussion. \u201cThe museum will offer programming that reflects our commitment to open dialogue, civic engagement and the diversity of American art and culture,\u201d Danielle Bias, its senior communications manager, said in a statement. Melissa Parsoff, director of communications for the nonprofit Dia Art Foundation, said, \u201cWe plan to be open but we are continuing to discuss this and to see how the situation unfolds in the coming days. \u201d She added, \u201cWe are giving our staff the opportunity to take the time off if they want to attend the protest. \u201d Many universities will be closed anyway on Jan. 20  \u2014   it\u2019s winter break. \u201cIf your school is open and relevant, you should go to school,\u201d said Tom Eccles, the executive director of Bard College\u2019s Center for Curatorial Studies. \u201cInauguration Day is symbolic but let\u2019s not just make it a day of symbolism. What we have to worry about is the next four years. At a certain moment in history, one has to retrench and consider the forms of resistance one is promoting. The struggle is long, and I would say it is not our role to close. It is our role to watch, to listen, to encourage. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562216.6148508}
