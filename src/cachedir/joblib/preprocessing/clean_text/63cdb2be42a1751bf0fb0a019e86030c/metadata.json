The hacker \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d \u2014 which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for Russian intelligence \u2014 claimed they would be monitoring elections \u201cfrom inside the system.\u201d \\nThe U.S. preparations are no different than Russia and China\u2019s probing of U.S. networks. The penetration caused no damage to Russia, instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission. Cyber weapons could be deployed if the U.S. suffered a significant attack, but officials tell NBC News that is an unlikely scenario. Just to be sure though, Obama administration officials issued a back-channel warning to Russia to stay out of the election. \\n\u201cYou\u2019d gain access to a network, you\u2019d establish your presence on the network and then you\u2019re poised to do what you would like to do with the network,\u201d Gary Brown, a former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told NBC News. \\nU.S. cyber capabilities are top of the line, but the Obama administration has been wary of deploying them, despite consistent Russian provocation. CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency, the agencies responsible for U.S. cyber security, are incredibly secretive regarding U.S. capabilities. Stuxnet is the most well-known, publicized U.S. cyber weapon. The highly advanced computer worm wreaked havoc on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program in 2010. \\nCYBERCOM is currently involved in cyber attacks against the Islamic State, but Pentagon officials have been especially silent on the exact details of the \u201c cyber bombs \u201d being dropped on the terrorist group. Russia may find itself the next target, should it decide to go from misinformation campaigns to attacks on infrastructure.'"}, "time": 1742628360.8440995}
