Y.  \u2014   Angelika Graswald, the woman accused of killing her fianc\u00e9 while on a kayak outing last year, asked an investigator who \u201cMiranda\u201d was  \u2014   a few hours after she had been read her Miranda rights, according to testimony in a pretrial hearing here on Tuesday. In his   of the investigator, Ms. Graswald\u2019s lawyer, Richard A. Portale, sought to show that his client, a native of Latvia, did not grasp the implications of the   police interrogation that preceded her arrest on    charges. \u201cMy client,\u201d Mr. Portale said in court, \u201cis asking, \u2018What\u2019s Miranda? Who\u2019s Miranda? \u2019\u201d The investigator, Donald DeQuarto, responded that he felt confident that earlier in the police interrogation, Ms. Graswald had comprehended her rights. \u201cI asked her if she understood it, and she stated yes,\u201d Mr. DeQuarto said. \u201cI remember her reading the piece of paper and writing it onto a piece of paper, the Miranda warning. \u201d During the interrogation, Ms. Graswald admitted to removing the drain plug of the kayak that belonged to her fianc\u00e9, Vincent Viafore, and also tampering with his paddle. Mr. Viafore, 46, drowned on April 19, 2015, when his kayak capsized in rough water on the Hudson River. The Miranda warning is usually read to suspects at the start of a police interrogation. It alerts them to their right to remain silent and to obtain a lawyer, and is intended to preserve the admissibility of evidence at trial. The Miranda rights get their name from a case involving Ernesto Arturo Miranda, a laborer whose confession led to his conviction for armed robbery, kidnapping and rape. His appeal resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1966 that said suspects must be informed of their right to legal representation and against  . The purpose of the pretrial hearing is to determine how investigators obtained their evidence. In the case against Ms. Graswald, 36, the case hinges largely on statements she made to the police, including the videotaped interrogation that Mr. Portale is trying to keep out of the trial. During the hearing, Mr. DeQuarto said that he had read Ms. Graswald her Miranda rights only after they had spoken for more than three hours at the police barracks in Orange County. The questioning came 10 days after Mr. Viafore\u2019s kayak had capsized in the river an autopsy report ruled the cause of death a drowning and the manner of death homicide, citing the \u201ckayak drain plug intentionally removed by other. \u201d Prosecutors say that Ms. Graswald was motivated by Mr. Viafore\u2019s life insurance policy she stood to collect $250, 000 in benefits. The long interrogation followed an encounter earlier in the day between Ms. Graswald and the police on Bannerman Island, where the couple, who lived together in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. had rested the day he capsized. On the island, Ms. Graswald, who was laying a memorial wreath, had told Mr. DeQuarto that she felt \u201ctrapped\u201d in the relationship and confessed to sabotaging his kayak, he said in earlier testimony. But Mr. Portale said the video of the   interrogation shows that around the seventh hour, Ms. Graswald appears not to have understood her rights, inquiring about \u201cMiranda\u201d as though it might be a person. In another strange detail in a case full of them, Mr. DeQuarto testified that Ms. Graswald suggested she was pregnant at the time of Mr. Viafore\u2019s death. \u201cTwo hours in, she asks to use the bathroom,\u201d Mr. Portale said to Mr. DeQuarto. \u201cShe comes back and she relates to you that maybe she just had a miscarriage. Do you remember that?\u201d Mr. DeQuarto said he did remember. In other testimony, Susan McCardell, a volunteer gardener at Bannerman Island, said she saw Ms. Graswald in distress when she was with the officers on the island last spring. Investigators have testified that Ms. Graswald, who also volunteered on the island, seemed agitated. \u201cThey were bullying her she was crying,\u201d Ms. McCardell said. \u201cIt was obvious to anyone it was not a good situation. She was unhappy, she was crying, she did not want to be alone. \u201d But she said Ms. Graswald indicated that Ms. McCardell should not stay. So did the officers, she testified. Ms. McCardell said one of the investigators told her: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really need you. She\u2019s OK. \u201d Ms. McCardell said she returned a second time, about a   later, and found Ms. Graswald still in tears. \u201cShe was still crying. She was a little more agitated,\u201d Ms. McCardell said. \u201cI said: \u2018Do you want me to stay? I think I should be here with you. \u2019\u201d Her testimony contrasts with that of the investigators, who testified that while Ms. Graswald was agitated on the island, she seemed \u201c  \u201d on the boat ride back to Police Headquarters. Ms. Graswald\u2019s English skills could prove crucial to whether jurors are allowed to view the taped police interrogation. (A decision is expected in late July.) A native Russian speaker, Ms. Graswald arrived in the United States as an au pair more than 15 years ago. Mr. Portale has portrayed Ms. Graswald as struggling with English, but during the police investigation she demonstrated a sophisticated grasp of the language. In a video clip of the interrogation shown last fall on ABC\u2019s \u201c\u201d a detective asked: \u201cWhen you watched him in the water, was a part of you saying, \u2018My worries are going away now?\u2019 Were you almost . .. \u201d He paused, but she filled in the word, offering \u201ceuphoric. \u201d The detective said, \u201cEuphoric that he was gone  \u2014   you felt that way?\u201d She answered, \u201cI still do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561930.516101}
