His response to criticism from a member of Congress that Wanda, after a spectacular $8 billion shopping spree in Hollywood, is a propaganda threat and should be subject to more Justice Department scrutiny? It is \u201cnot like we are invading,\u201d Mr. Wang said, contending that Wanda\u2019s goal involves \u201chelping\u201d American film companies \u201cto get more market share in the emerging movies market that is China. \u201d (And, of course, making money for Wanda along the way.) Mr. Wang, visiting California to unveil sizable financial incentives aimed at wooing American productions to Wanda\u2019s new $5 billion studio complex in China, went on to call himself an \u201cangel\u201d investor. He noted that Wanda had purchased struggling companies like AMC Theaters and Legendary Entertainment  \u2014   \u201cthe best companies would not sell to us\u201d  \u2014   and strengthened them. AMC\u2019s stock price, for instance, has risen 64 percent since Wanda bought it for $2. 6 billion in 2012. But what about concerns that Wanda is moving aggressively in Hollywood as part of a move by the Communist Party to control the portrayal of China on screen? Mr. Wang, who noted that Wanda was focused on entertainment \u201cprofit\u201d 14 times during a   interview, said storytelling decisions by American studios in relation to China, with or without Wanda ownership, were about maximizing returns at the   Chinese box office. \u201cMore Chinese elements mean more Chinese profits,\u201d he said. Mr. Wang arrived by private jet over the weekend to wrap up Wanda\u2019s latest acquisition  \u2014   the company is buying Dick Clark Productions for about $1 billion  \u2014   and dangle an enormous carrot in front of Warner Bros. 20th Century Fox, Paramount, Universal and Walt Disney. Wanda and the Qingdao municipal government have established a major incentive program to lure movie and TV production to the   Qingdao Movie Metropolis. Billed as an effort to \u201cbridge the entertainment capitals of the world,\u201d the program will provide a 40 percent rebate on certain production spending in Qingdao, which is about 450 miles north of Shanghai and is the site of Wanda Studios, still under construction. Scheduled to fully open in 2018, Wanda Studios will feature 30 advanced soundstages, including the world\u2019s largest at over 107, 000 square feet an underwater stage and a   back lot. The rebate on each film or television production will be limited to $18 million. The total amount available to disperse will be $150 million annually. There will be three classifications of rebate productions, according to Wanda, and only one of those would require Chinese cultural elements, Chinese actors and Chinese investors  \u2014   films classified by the Chinese government as   that are not subject to import limits. (Only 34   films are allowed to play in the country annually and those must suit Chinese censors.) Applications will be evaluated by a   committee of government officials and Wanda executives, a Wanda spokeswoman said. The incentives plan was to be announced on Monday by Mr. Wang Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Jack Gao, the head of Wanda\u2019s Cultural Industry Group. A private dinner for 100 studio executives and agency chiefs was planned, with performances from acrobats, magicians and a Chinese pop star. Mr. Wang, a spry former military officer who is said to be China\u2019s richest man, said he hoped that an additional $3 billion in Qingdao amenities  \u2014   \u201cinternational hospitals, international schools, yacht clubs, hotels, shopping\u201d  \u2014   would make American stars and marquee directors more willing to spend months at a time working there. \u201cLike going on a vacation\u201d is how he described it. He added that the incentives were not just about busying Wanda Studios and increasing the supply of movies to Wanda\u2019s theaters, both in China, where it controls 3, 056 screens, and elsewhere. \u201cAm I a fool? Of course not,\u201d he said, with a laugh, before alluding to Wanda\u2019s vast real estate division. \u201cBecause I attract so many people, that place will become very popular and famous. And the value of the land there will increase. And I can sell more houses. \u201d If successful, the rebates could shift the global movie incentives game, in which Hollywood has moved production to locales like Canada, Romania and New Zealand. Legendary Entertainment has plans to film at least two movies under the program, including a sequel to \u201cPacific Rim. \u201d In an interview, Mary Parent, Legendary\u2019s production chief, dismissed concerns that Wanda was seeking to push a   agenda. \u201cThere has been zero interference with storytelling,\u201d she said. Ms. Parent, an   producer highly regarded in Hollywood, added that Wanda had made it possible for Legendary to increase its output. \u201cUnlike most Hollywood companies, we\u2019re not operating in a   environment, which creates tremendous opportunity,\u201d she said. Still, Mr. Wang\u2019s trip probably won\u2019t do much to ease concerns by some lawmakers, editorial writers and lobbyists about the ambition of Wanda, which has financial ties to relatives of senior Chinese Communist leaders. In an Oct. 6 letter to the Justice Department, Representative John Culberson, Republican of Texas, called for heightened oversight of Chinese moves in Hollywood. Mr. Culberson cited \u201cserious concerns\u201d about how Chinese media acquisitions \u201cmay be used for propaganda purposes. \u201d Mr. Wang said that Wanda intended to control 20 percent of the world\u2019s movie theater seats by 2020. It currently has about 13 percent, including those run in Europe by the Odeon and UCI Cinemas Group, which Wanda bought for $650 million. By 2020, Wanda aims to have annual revenue of $100 billion and net profits of $10 billion. With its real estate growth slowing, Wanda is also moving into sports. It recently paid $1. 2 billion for Infront Sports and Media, a sports marketing company, and tourist destinations, including a $3. 5 billion entertainment, shopping and hotel complex outside Paris. \u201cCash flow for real estate in China is not stable in the long term,\u201d he said. Wanda remains interested in buying more Hollywood companies as it seeks growth, including a major studio, he added. \u201cIf it is a very good company,\u201d he said, there will be \u201cno ceiling\u201d for the price offered. As Wanda pushes deeper into filmed entertainment, the company plans to build a $1. 2 billion headquarters in Beverly Hills \u201cto aid in China\u2019s entry into Hollywood\u2019s film industry and generally promote Chinese culture abroad,\u201d Wanda said in a news release. But it is clear that Mr. Wang, who spoke to The New York Times with the assistance of an interpreter, has gotten the message that a bit less bombast might help smooth Wanda\u2019s forward march. Take his approach to Disney. In the spring, as Disney was opening its first theme park resort on the Chinese mainland, the $5. 5 billion Shanghai Disneyland, Mr. Wang went on the attack. \u201cThe frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,\u201d Mr. Wang said on state television in May. At the time, Disney called his remarks \u201cpatently absurd. \u201d On Sunday, however, Mr. Wang struck a friendly tone. \u201cWe respect Disney,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition is unavoidable,\u201d he added, noting that Wanda has five    properties open in China and seven more under construction. \u201cBut I respect Disney very much. \u201d Mr. Wang said he had personally visited every Disney resort in the world, with the exception of the Shanghai outpost. In person, Mr. Wang came across as a disciplined executive  \u2014   he arrived at exactly 8:59 a. m. for a 9 a. m. appointment and stayed exactly one hour  \u2014   who cared only about making money and not tinkering with scripts. He said that he had not seen any video from \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d a coming $150 million Legendary Entertainment film starring Matt Damon. He \u201cis not quite into the technical details like that, because the entire movie sector in Wanda accounts for only   or   of the revenue,\u201d he said. Wanda\u2019s culture division, which includes the theme parks, domestic movie theaters and sports holdings, made a profit of 43. 9 million Chinese renminbi, or $6. 5 million, in the first half of 2015, against assets of about $11 billion, according to a Wanda stock prospectus. The more   that Mr. Wang can appear, of course, the better Wanda will fare among those calling for heightened scrutiny of its entertainment dealings. But all that matters to Hollywood is Wanda\u2019s money. The mainstream movie industry, after all, has been only too happy to   its scripts in an effort to appease Chinese regulators and win clearance into a   market. By that measure, Qingdao applications should already be rolling in.'"}, "time": 1742562067.1979244}
