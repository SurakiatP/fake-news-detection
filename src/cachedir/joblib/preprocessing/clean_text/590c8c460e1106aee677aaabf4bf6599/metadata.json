Local villager: \u201cThere is a military base here, air defense system and missiles. There are air defense systems on every cape here.\u201d On the outskirts of the port city of Sevastopol sits another radar station called \u201cDnepr.\u201d Russian newspaper Izvestiya: Moscow will restore the Dnepr station so it can \u201cdetect launches of ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles from the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea area.\u201d In Crimea region Russia has 18 sites, including naval bases, radar stations and airfields.

Poland is hosting the other main land-based component in the shield. Washington: The shield is designed as a defense against Iranian missile strikes. Russian President Vladimir Putin: The system and NATO are both threats to Russia\u2019s security, our country will retaliate. \\n(SIMFEROPOL, CRIMEA) The missile bunkers that dot the verdant hills along Crimea\u2019s southern coast are known locally as Object 100. Until recently, tourists paid $50 to visit the crumbling and abandoned former Soviet sites, which served during the Cold War as a defense against naval attack from the Black Sea. \\nNow the bunkers are coming back online. After Russia took control of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, signs went up in the woods around the sites warning visitors against entering a \u201cforbidden zone of the Russian Ministry of Defense.\u201d A resident of a nearby village who said he was employed at the base last year said Russian soldiers had re-occupied the sites and blocked roads leading into the area. He was unable to say when the Russian soldiers arrived. \\n\u201cIt is a functioning military base with an anti-ship missile system,\u201d the villager told a Reuters reporter who visited the area in July. \\nThe bunkers are just one small part of a new Russian program to militarize the Crimean peninsula. Based on recent site observations by Reuters, accounts from locals, media reports and official Russian data, Moscow has reanimated multiple Soviet-built facilities in the region, built new bases and stationed soldiers there. \\nCrimea sits at the southern end of a line of new and refurbished Russian military facilities that stretches north in an arc through western Russia and ends in the country\u2019s Baltic outpost of Kaliningrad. \\nThe military buildup is echoed in NATO countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, where U.S. forces are beefing up patrols and conducting more frequent exercises.'"}, "time": 1742563660.896817}
