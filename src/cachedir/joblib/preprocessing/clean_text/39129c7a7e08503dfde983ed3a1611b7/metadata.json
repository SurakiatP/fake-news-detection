I think \u2018misinformed\u2019 is another,\u201d he told the outlet.  According to Town Hall, Moore explained that he sees gun control as a \u201ccop out\u201d by weak politicians as a way for them to blame the gun instead of the criminal who uses the gun for ill. Moore said: Mental health is the real problem. If it wasn\u2019t guns, it would be knives, etc. To blame it on the tool being used, in my opinion, is ignorant. They want to put a   over a gaping wound in my opinion. You\u2019re trying to rationalize with irrational people. It\u2019s impossible. The problem isn\u2019t the NRA, we\u2019re not the ones out there doing extreme things. These comments square perfectly with Moore\u2019s new song \u201cGuns. \u201d The lyrics of the second verse and chorus provide a clear expression of his view of Second Amendment rights: If there ever was a time we need \u2019em, I\u2019d say it be today. When we\u2019re letting them terrorists watch cable TVAnd walk out of Guantanamo Bay. I just try to do the right thing and raise my family in this land. Treating me like you want to be treated and that\u2019s what I call a man. If we don\u2019t have \u2019em, what do we do. Tell me where we gonna go. Somebody breaks into my house, I\u2019m gonna need my Colt forty four, Guns, whether Remingtons or Glocks. Come on man it, ain\u2019t like I\u2019m a slingin\u2019 \u2019em on the block. I\u2019m gonna tell you once and listen son. As long as I\u2019m alive and breathing, You wont take my guns. Town Hall reported that Moore opened his February 3 Fairfax, Virginia, concert by saying, \u201cI was at the NRA museum today. And if you don\u2019t like that you can get the hell out  \u2014   respectfully. \u201d   AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
