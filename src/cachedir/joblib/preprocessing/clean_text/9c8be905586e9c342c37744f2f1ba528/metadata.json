The Brazilians yelled right back, heralding the career goal tally of Pel\u00e9, their soccer hero, and crowing about their five World Cup trophies. They made sure, of course, to insult Diego Maradona, Argentina\u2019s own World Cup legend. It was, in many ways, a typical sardonic showdown between fans of the two   South American rivals  \u2014   except it was happening on Wednesday night at a basketball game between Argentina and the United States. After the Americans had scuffled through the final three games of the pool stage, Coach Mike Krzyzewski suggested that the presence in the quarterfinal round of the Argentine fans  \u2014   who had been making so much noise the last two weeks  \u2014   might invigorate his players. Whether it helped or not, the Americans looked lively amid the noise, sauntering to a   win that left the Brazilian fans  \u2014   their sports allies for a night  \u2014   singing in joy. As the seconds ticked off the clock in the blowout, Brazilian fans yelled out \u201cOl\u00e9!\u201d to usher the Argentines out of Carioca Arena 1. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d said Paul George, who had 17 points and 8 rebounds and galvanized his team with his defensive effort. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if they were against each other or if they were cheering with each other. \u201d The Americans will face Spain  \u2014   which steamrollered France,    \u2014   on Friday in the semifinals. \u201cWe enjoyed it,\u201d George said. \u201cThat\u2019s new to us. We enjoyed being in this atmosphere. \u201d The Americans, many of them still relatively new to international basketball, had found the vibe at their earlier games a bit odd. The stands at the Olympic arena sit far back from the sidelines. Nonpartisan crowds at certain games did not seem compelled to make much noise. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a golf tournament,\u201d DeMarcus Cousins said this week, gently tapping the fingers on his right hand against the palm of his left. \u201cIt\u2019s different. \u201d The Americans are used to the atmosphere of the N. B. A. with the familiar tableau of the league\u2019s arenas. Sound technicians make sure to quash any threat of silence with thunderous music. Courtside seats creep up along the sidelines, eliminating personal space between players and fans. \u201cYou can\u2019t hear as much trash talking as usual,\u201d DeAndre Jordan said about the fans in Rio. On Wednesday, Argentine fans arrived early to spread their jollity inside and around the arena. They belted out the country\u2019s national anthem in full voice. They were eager to scream, and it helped that their team got off to a fast start, jumping out to a   lead in the first quarter. Whenever the United States fans started a chant  \u2014   \u201c  !\u201d or \u201c !\u201d  \u2014   they were drowned in a torrent of whistles and jeers from the Argentine fans. The local Brazilians, who consider Argentina their big sports rival, did some jeering of their own on the Americans\u2019 behalf. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of soccer,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThe fans are engaged in the game. They have chants and cheers and the wave going. It\u2019s cool. \u201d The decibel level dropped for a spell, though, as the Americans charged back, producing a   scoring run at one point. Halfway through the second quarter, Kyrie Irving displayed his exceptional   skills, stringing together a dizzying sequence of crossovers on Nicolas Laprovittola to create an opening to the rim. Amid the momentary quiet, the Americans made their own fun. In the second quarter, when Kevin Durant (27 points) disassembled Andres Nocioni with a crossover  \u2014   before scoring on a     fadeaway combination  \u2014   the reserves on the American bench popped off their seats and pirouetted with delight. Despite the loss, Argentine fans\u2019 spirits were high. Asked at halftime about the atmosphere, Gerardo Genzano, a fan from Argentina, said, \u201cArgentina has taken over Rio. \u201d Asked who would win, he changed the subject. \u201cWe need more beer,\u201d he said. Durant, who averaged 16. 8 points in the first five games, was unstoppable. He shot 9 for 13 from the field, including 7 for 9 from   range, and added seven rebounds and six assists before sitting for most of the fourth quarter. Durant described the knockout game as a Game 7 and praised his teammates for raising their intensity level. He complimented the outward national pride of the Argentine fans. He said he had heard chants of \u201c  !\u201d rising above the din. \u201cIt gave me chills,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562170.5353062}
