[Professor Wendy Savage, a member of the ethics committee of the British Medical Association, said women should be able to have an abortion at any stage of pregnancy for whatever reason, even when the child would be able to survive outside of the womb.  She also said that abortion pills should be available online without the need to see a doctor or nurse. There has been growing concern in Britain that an increasing number of women are seeking abortions simply because they do not want girls, leading to some hospitals refusing to tell parents the sex of their babies. However, Professor Savage told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cBecause of this sort of anxiety some places won\u2019t tell the woman the sex of the foetus, which is outrageous. \u201cIt\u2019s her body and her foetus, so she should have that information  \u2026     If a woman does not want to have a foetus who is one sex or the other, forcing her [to go through with the pregnancy] is not going to be good for the eventual child, and it\u2019s not going to be good for [the mother\u2019s] mental health. \u201d She previously caused outrage after signing a letter claiming   abortion is not \u201cgender discrimination\u201d because that only applies to \u201cliving people\u201d. She then doubled down on those views, claiming the unborn child is not really a person. \u201cThe foetus is a potential human life at that stage [in the womb] it is not an actual human life  \u2026     I think you\u2019ve got to concentrate on the [rights of the] woman. \u201d   campaigners have branded her comments \u201cutterly abhorrent\u201d with Conservative MP Mark Field saying: \u201cTo have someone like Wendy Savage with her extreme views at the heart of the BMA is a very worrying sign. The majority of people in this country, even those who support abortion, think   abortion is a step too far. \u201d \u201cEffectively we have abortion on demand nowadays, and all the safeguards we are supposed to have are being ridden roughshod over,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742564587.0572336}
