Mr. Rose, who has made   claims in the past that did not hold up to scrutiny, said a \u201c  \u201d John J. Bates, a recently retired scientist at NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, had told him that the agency \u201cbreached its own rules on scientific integrity\u201d in publishing the study in June 2015. According to Mr. Rose, the study, which refuted earlier work that suggested global warming had slowed in the first decade of this century, \u201cwas aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders\u201d at the talks in Paris in December 2015 that led to the agreement by more than 190 nations to set limits on carbon emissions. After Mr. Rose\u2019s article was published, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and its chairman, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, wrote about it on Twitter. Beginning in 2013, scientists published papers showing that, according to land and sea surface temperature data, the rate of global warming had slowed since the late 1990s. This pause or hiatus, as it was often called, puzzled scientists because it came despite a continuing increase in emissions of carbon dioxide and other   gases. The findings also became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among climate change denialists, who cited the papers as evidence that concerns about global warming were at the least overblown. The 2015 paper, by Thomas R. Karl, who was then director of the National Centers for Environmental Information, and others, used improved data sets to show that the slowdown probably did not occur at all. Because temperature data was collected in different ways over the years  \u2014   and some methods were more reliable than others  \u2014   it is normal for the data to be refined and adjusted. Mr. Karl\u2019s paper reflected the latest refinements, especially for ocean data. In the Mail on Sunday article, Dr. Bates, who at one point was in charge of archiving climate data at the centers, accused Mr. Karl of having used \u201cunverified\u201d data. In a long blog post published Saturday, Dr. Bates went into extensive detail  \u2014   the kind that only true data geeks could love  \u2014   about how data sets are or are not archived and verified at NOAA. But Dr. Bates also accused Mr. Karl of misusing the process. \u201cWe find Tom Karl\u2019s thumb on the scale pushing for, and often insisting on, decisions that maximize warming and minimize documentation,\u201d he wrote. Republicans on the House committee and Mr. Smith, in particular, have long attacked Mr. Karl\u2019s paper and have focused on it as part of a lingering investigation of what Mr. Smith has described as the Obama administration\u2019s \u201csuspect climate agenda. \u201d The committee has demanded that NOAA researchers turn over emails related to the work the scientists have refused to do so. Climate scientists, some of whom had worked on the data sets, voiced support for the work of Mr. Karl and the other researchers. In a post on the blog of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University, Peter Thorne, who worked on the data but left NOAA before work began on the paper itself, disputed much of what Dr. Bates said. Dr. Bates, Dr. Thorne wrote, was not involved in the data work and had misrepresented \u201cthe processes that actually occurred. \u201d Dr. Thorne also disputed the idea that Mr. Karl had his \u201cthumb on the scale. \u201d Mr. Karl only used the data  \u2014   he was not personally involved in the refinements, Dr. Thorne wrote. \u201cAt no point was any pressure brought to bear to make any scientific or technical choices. \u201d In a post at Carbon Brief, a British website that covers climate science and policy, Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, disputed the contention that the data sets used in Mr. Karl\u2019s paper were unverified or that the data had been manipulated. Dr. Hausfather was one of the authors of a review of the NOAA ocean data, which showed the most change. The paper, published in January, compared the old and new NOAA data with independent data from satellites, buoys and other sources and found that the new data matched the independent data more closely. The result, he wrote, \u201cstrongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years. \u201d In an interview on Monday with EE News, Dr. Bates appeared to distance himself from some of what he wrote in the blog post, and from the way his criticisms were portrayed in the Mail on Sunday article. \u201cThe issue here is not an issue of tampering with data,\u201d he said, \u201cbut rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was. \u201d Climate Home, a nonprofit site based in London that offers news and analysis, also weighed in on one of the central contentions of Mr. Rose\u2019s article, that the publication of the NOAA paper had \u201dduped\u201d policy makers into adopting the Paris accord. The site contacted representatives to the talks from 10 countries none said that the paper had any influence.'"}, "time": 1742562523.2219818}
