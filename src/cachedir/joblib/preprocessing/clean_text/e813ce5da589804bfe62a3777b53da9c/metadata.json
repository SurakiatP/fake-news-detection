It\u2019s a scandal.\u201d \\nWallace had attempted to get answers from Clinton about the issue at the final presidential debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump. \\nBut of course Clinton ducked the moderator\u2019s question and instead talked about the organization\u2019s charitable donations rather than its extreme conflicts of interest \u2014 something Woodward took note of and criticized her for. \\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t answer your question at all,\u201d Woodward told Wallace. \u201cAnd she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done.\u201d \\nWoodward apparently didn\u2019t want to discredit the \u201cgood work\u201d done by the organization, but pointed out that even its \u201cgood work\u201d is compromised by the overwhelming evidence of corruption. \\n\u201c(T)he mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation and actions by the State Department \u2014 which she ran \u2014 are all intertwined and it\u2019s corrupt,\u201d he argued. \\nHe\u2019s correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clinton\u2019s role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. \\nUnfortunately Clinton has an acute ability to avoid being held accountable for her scandals, but we have faith in the American people and their desire to be led by a person with integrity and respect for the office he holds, not someone who continuously looks for ways for his political power to benefit his personal life. \\nLike and share on Facebook and Twitter if you agree with Bob Woodward about Hillary Clinton and her family\u2019s scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation.
