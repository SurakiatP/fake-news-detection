[\u201cI think it was a total home run,\u201d said Sims of the speech. \u201cI can just tell you  \u2014   the White House staff  \u2014   we stayed up here last night at the office and when the President returned we all kind of huddled and welcomed him back with a pretty big round of applause and cheers. \u201d  Added Sims, Even last night on CNN the polling on the speech was just unbelievable.   percent had a positive view of the speech.   percent said the policies that were in the speech would move the country in a right direction.   percent said they were more optimistic after watching the speech and I think that number, in particular, is a really notable one  \u2026    . Sims said he believes we are at \u201ca unifying moment for the country. \u201d In terms of some of Trump\u2019s ideas coming from the Democrat side of the aisle, said Sims, \u201cIt is not a concerted strategy in the sense of let\u2019s find a way that we can just take issues away from them, as much as it is somebody who is finally willing to get up there and just actually be for what he actually believes in his heart, even if it doesn\u2019t follow traditional party lines. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
