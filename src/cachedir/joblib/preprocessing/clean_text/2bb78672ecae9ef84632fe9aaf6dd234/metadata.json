Major props to Vanessa for getting herself prepared! \\nWith just a few short months before the president-elect comes to power, Vanessa has been taking herself out into the world every single day and soaking up as much human dignity as time permits. Whether she\u2019s at home, at work, running errands, or even at the gym, Vanessa is seizing every chance to feel like a respected, autonomous human being before it all gets taken away from her on January 20. \\nShe now basks in the joy of visiting her doctor, unencumbered by the decisions others will soon make on her behalf. She relishes every interaction with her male coworkers while she still gets to feel like their peer. And she loves taking daily jogs around her neighborhood, savoring every last minute of the relative safety she temporarily still feels. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting down to the wire, but I\u2019m just focused on hoarding as many normal human experiences as I can,\u201d noted Vanessa, standing in the middle of her local grocery store and reveling in the feeling of having most of her civil rights intact. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many moments like these I\u2019ll get to have, so I figure I should stockpile some for the next four to eight years before it\u2019s too late.\u201d \\nSmart move, Vanessa! \\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that women even have to think about things like this in 2016, but we commend Vanessa for taking necessary precautions. Ladies, let\u2019s all learn a lesson from Vanessa: If you\u2019d like to experience a little human dignity before Trump is in the Oval Office, now is the time to do it!'"}, "time": 1742564299.0756311}
