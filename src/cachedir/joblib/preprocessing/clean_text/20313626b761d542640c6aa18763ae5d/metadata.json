It\u2019s the moment when a single image or phrase or blunder could change the trajectory of the campaign. But when is a turning point really a turning point? Where  \u2014   if at all  \u2014   does Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d remark or her health scare at the Sept. 11 memorial land on that scale? What about Donald J. Trump\u2019s widely denounced comments about Mexicans and Muslims? In the latest episode of The   my colleagues on the campaign team answer those questions by talking about the turning points they\u2019ve experienced in this race  \u2014   not always the big,   kind, but frequently the smaller, subtler,   ones that nevertheless signaled a shift in the political terrain. Our guests are Patrick Healy, a national political reporter Amy Chozick, who covers the Clinton campaign Ashley Parker, who reports on Donald J. Trump Maggie Haberman, who has written about both candidates Robert Draper, a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine and Jim Rutenberg, the media columnist at The Times. And we look back at what many regard as the biggest turning point of the last presidential campaign, in 2012, to explore whether it was as consequential as everyone thought at the time.
