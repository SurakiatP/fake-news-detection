The report on the Saydnaya military prison, which Amnesty said was based on interviews with former detainees there, prison employees, judges and others, accuses the Syrian government of systematically executing perceived opponents after sham trials that lasted just a few minutes. Inmates are kept under conditions so dismal  \u2014   including regular, severe beatings and deprivation of food, water, medicine and basic sanitation  \u2014   that they amount to deliberate extermination, defined under international law as a crime against humanity, the report said. While inhumane prison conditions in Syria have been known for decades, the Amnesty report laid out what it described as new details  \u2014   not documented by any human rights monitoring group to date  \u2014   about the scale of the killings and the state systems required to facilitate them, including approvals by   officials. \u201cWe now know where, when and how often these hangings are taking place, as well as which elements of the Syrian government have authorized them,\u201d said Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty researcher specializing in detention issues and one of the report\u2019s authors. Mr. Assad, in an interview with The New York Times and other journalists last year, insisted that detainees were being treated according to Syrian law and that their families could locate them by appealing to the judicial system. But the report corroborates numerous accounts given to The Times by current and former detainees in several prisons across Syria, detailing regular torture and deprivation. It also echoes reports from families of detainees that the government has refused to provide even basic information such as where they are and whether they are alive. According to former officials cited in the report, detainees  \u2014   most of them accused of nonviolent offenses, such as participating in demonstrations  \u2014   are tortured into giving confessions, then taken to   military field courts, where they undergo trials lasting two to three minutes. At regular intervals, the Amnesty report said, they are gathered in the middle of the night from their cells and taken blindfolded to an execution room on the grounds of the prison near Damascus, where they are hanged. Some prisoners have managed to stand on toilets to look out windows and see bodies carted away, and the number of slippers left lying on the ground. \u201cIf there were 30 slippers, then we knew that 15 people had been executed,\u201d Abu Osama, a former military officer detained in the prison, was quoted as saying. \u201cThere were usually between 30 and 80 slippers outside. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628539.6804175}
