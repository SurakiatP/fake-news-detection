Trump hopscotched from Pennsylvania to North Carolina to Michigan on Monday in the final, frenzied hours of the presidential campaign, offering clashing closing arguments as the sprawling map of the United States was reduced to a string of   states. Accompanied by rock stars,   old friends and their grown children, the Democratic and Republican nominees pleaded with voters to end a traumatic campaign with an emphatic endorsement of their visions for the country. In Philadelphia, Mrs. Clinton drew the biggest crowd of her   campaign to the vast plaza in front of Independence Hall, where Bruce Springsteen, the balladeer of   America, rhapsodized about her values and the candidate portrayed herself as a protector of freedom and equality. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time. What will we vote for  \u2014   not just against?\u201d Mrs. Clinton asked. \u201cEvery issue you care about is at stake. \u201d She concluded with an appeal to those who have waited decades for a female president. \u201cLet\u2019s make history together,\u201d she said. In Manchester, N. H. Mr. Trump took the stage with his family at Southern New Hampshire University Arena as \u201cGod Bless the U. S. A. \u201d blared, blue laser beams illuminated the dark hall and a smoke machine piped a haze over the crowd. Mr. Trump asked a country polarized over his personality and tactics to embrace his plan to thoroughly shake up Washington. \u201cI am asking for the votes of all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cwho are so desperately in need of change. \u201d The contrasts between the candidates and their messages were on vivid display in the campaign\u2019s last full day. As she embarked on a   tour, Mrs. Clinton gave a sunny and optimistic summation of her candidacy for the White House. \u201cTomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive,   America,\u201d she told a crowd in Pittsburgh. Mr. Trump, who campaigned in five states on Monday, took a harsher approach, assailing the \u201ccrooked media,\u201d attacking a \u201ccorrupt Washington establishment\u201d and mocking Mrs. Clinton over and over. \u201cIt\u2019s a rigged, rigged system,\u201d he declared in Raleigh, N. C. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. \u201d As the campaign wound down, both candidates dispensed with ritual. Mrs. Clinton, who relishes upbraiding her opponent, toned down her usual assault on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and temperament. And Mr. Trump, who normally seeks to convey confidence at all times, sounded uncharacteristically vulnerable. \u201cThey say we\u2019ll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose,\u201d he said during a rally in Sarasota, Fla. \u201cI said: \u2018No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want any credit if we lose. \u2019\u201d Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there were signs that Americans were seizing the opportunity to express themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high, and in interviews, many voters said they were eager to bring an end to this unusual, exhausting and still suspenseful election. \u201cI\u2019m totally ready for this election to be over,\u201d said Mary Hoch, 54, who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Sarasota with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on her head and a \u201cDeplorable Lives Matter\u201d pin on her shirt. Ms. Hoch predicted a Trump victory. \u201cI think there are a lot of silent Trump voters,\u201d she said. Daniel Saunders, 58, who attended a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Charlotte, N. C. was just as exasperated by the race. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by it,\u201d he said. But Mr. Saunders said he believed that Mrs. Clinton would eke out a win. \u201cThese things always tighten up, but I think she\u2019ll pull it out,\u201d he said. Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton sent their running mates, families and allies across the country to maximize their reach in crucial swing states. Mr. Trump relied on his three oldest children  \u2014   Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.  \u2014   along with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican   nominee. Mrs. Clinton deployed President Obama and former President Bill Clinton, as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the first lady, Michelle Obama, perhaps the most popular political figure in the country. \u201cTomorrow, with your vote, you can say that this country has always been great,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cThat it is the greatest country on earth. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, spent much of the day campaigning in North Carolina, which Mr. Obama carried in 2008 but lost four years later to Mitt Romney. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see a finish line, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mr. Kaine said at an outdoor rally in Charlotte. He expressed confidence in the ticket\u2019s chances on Tuesday, but warned supporters against complacency and implored voters to embrace the chance to elect the nation\u2019s first female president. \u201cEvery election is important, but not every election will change history,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do what we know how to do, this election will change history. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, started the day with a brisk jog across a windswept tarmac in an unlikely spot for a Republican: Duluth, Minn. It was the Republican ticket\u2019s second stop in   Minnesota in two days, and although few signs point to a Republican upset there, a modest crowd near Mr. Pence\u2019s plane lapped up his attacks on Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s almost hard to keep up, all the headlines, all the scandals flowing out of just her years as secretary of state,\u201d Mr. Pence said. Both campaigns conspicuously reached across party lines in their final pitches. In Scranton, Pa. Mr. Trump spoke to what he said were \u201cDemocratic voters in this country who are thirsting for change. \u201d In Ann Arbor, Mich. Mrs. Clinton reminded an audience of her days as an intern for President Gerald R. Ford, a Republican from Michigan, and of all the Republican leaders who have endorsed her this year. \u201cWe must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election,\u201d she said. Mr. Trump seemed sensitive to the fact that his final 48 hours on the campaign trail lacked the star power drawn to Mrs. Clinton, who was accompanied by musicians like Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga and Mr. Springsteen. (Collectively, her surrogates have more than 80 Grammy Awards.) \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z,\u201d Mr. Trump said dismissively. \u201cI like them. \u201d But, he added mischievously, \u201cI get bigger crowds than they do. \u201d But the hypercompetitive Mr. Trump could not resist trying to outshine his rival. In Manchester, he read aloud a letter that he said was from Bill Belichick, the coach of the New England Patriots football team. \u201cCongratulations on a tremendous campaign,\u201d it purportedly read. \u201cYou have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully. \u201d (A spokesman for the Patriots said he could not confirm or deny the letter\u2019s authenticity Monday night.) As a final flourish, Mr. Trump claimed that Tom Brady, the team\u2019s quarterback and a hero across New England, had cast a vote for him. In a radio interview on Monday, however, Mr. Brady said he had not yet voted.'"}, "time": 1742562010.2708397}
