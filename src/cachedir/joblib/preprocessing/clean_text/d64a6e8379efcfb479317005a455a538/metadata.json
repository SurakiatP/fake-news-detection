Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nRepublicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for \u201cvoter fraud\u201d. \\nThe United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNC\u2019s poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. \\nThe order demands affidavits from several parties, including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendant\u2019s (RNC\u2019s) efforts with the Trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country, \u201cas indicated by Kellyanne Conway\u201d. \\nAffidavits are also demanded from several Republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide \u201cvoter fraud\u201d monitoring and poll monitoring, such as RNC member Rob Gleason\u2019s efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and RNC member Ronna Romney McDaniel\u2019s efforts in Michigan to prepare a \u201cmassive, statewide anti-voter fraud effort\u201d. \\nThe RNC must also answer for Governor Mike Pence\u2019s comments that the Trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure \u201cballot integrity\u201d. \\nThis is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante. \\nRick Hasen at Election Law Blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad, \u201cPretty broad discovery required in short order, with hearing on November 4.\u201d \\nHowever, \u201cThe judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the DNC given the time frame, but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes.\u201d \\nThe DNC filed a lawsuit against the Republican National Committee for violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own (often in \u201curban\u201d areas) to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isn\u2019t likely to stand for it. \\nSo now discovery has been court-ordered, which is just more bad news for Republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the White House. \\nIt\u2019s exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote. Everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation. Don\u2019t let anyone dissuade you from voting. \\nThe full court ruling is available here.\""}, "time": 1742628534.4859457}
