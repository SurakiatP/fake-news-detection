Rep. Keith Ellison (D}, Minnesota), center \\nKeith Ellison , a Marxist/Muslim Democratic Congressman from Minnesota, could soon become the Democratic National Committee chairman. \\nWith the endorsements of Senators Harry Reid , Chuck Schumer , Bernie Sanders and more than 250,000 signatures on an \u201cEllison for chairman\u201d petition, Representative Ellison is the early favorite for the position. \\nMany writers have focused on Ellison\u2019s Islamic beliefs, but few have examined his extensive Marxist connections. \\nTrevor Loudon\u2019s The Enemies Within poses a simple question \u2013\u201cCould your Congressman pass an FBI background check?\u201d \\nWith close ties to both the Communist Party USA and several Muslim Brotherhood front groups, Trevor Loudon believes that Congressman Ellison would have no chance of passing even the most the rudimentary type of background check, applied to the most low-level federal government employees. \\nYet within days, Representative Ellison may lead one of this country\u2019s two main political parties. \\nFor further information contact Trevor Loudon, 772-267-8189, or trevor@enemieswithinmovie.com.

As America threatens to shatter, we must see how a semi-covert, global, cartel collective and their NWO in the USA (\"progressive\" neo-Marxists and neo-fascists corporatists, updated with 21st Century techniques and technology) intentionally perpetrate this sabotage, while we patriots try to prevent it. Have a look around our camp, as we struggle to survive. - your tour guide Archives Militarization in America About DHS militarization, see the new, breakthrough analysis from James Simpson, \" Police Militarization, Abuses of Power, and the Road to Impeachment \" and our earlier, \"Marxist President\u2019s Military Exercises in These U.S. Cities; Yours One?\" \\nAbout the trajectory of this, we must pray, communicate, keep calm, and do not become the first to engage. If it comes to it, do not even respond in kind, until after the after the first times that extreme, anti-American violence is done by them. It calls for an attitude of self sacrifice -- first cheek, second cheek, then no more. \\nAnd speak out about the potential and strategic \"sense\" of the Obama/NWO\\'s DHS carrying out false flag missions of violence, blaming it on American patriots, perhaps upon our militia movements. \\nWe are in a real war, right now (of which others and I have been trying to alert fellow Sovereign Citizens for years) and the prime war is for the minds, hearts, and wills of the American People. We are opposed by an anti-American insurrection using any means of power (see Gramsci, Frankfurt School) including government power, as they are granted that opportunity.'"}, "time": 1742564424.802623}
