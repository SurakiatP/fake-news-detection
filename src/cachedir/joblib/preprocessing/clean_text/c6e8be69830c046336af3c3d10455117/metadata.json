S. Pacific Command. [\u201cSouth Korea and the US are aware of the missile launch and to their knowledge, North Korea\u2019s missile was not successfully launched,\u201d said South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Defense about the North Korean missile test, in a statement relayed by CNN.  Reuters reports the launch was made from \u201cnear the city of Wonsan, on North Korea\u2019s east coast, the same place from where it launched several   missiles last year, all but one of which failed. \u201d A South Korean military official agreed with the U. S. assessment that the missile \u201cmay have exploded right after it took off from a launch pad. \u201d The Washington Post writes that American and South Korean military intelligence services are still analyzing the data they gathered about the launch and are not yet certain precisely what type of missile it was. North Korea tested a rocket engine that dictator Kim   described as technology of \u201chistoric significance\u201d over the weekend, but it\u2019s not clear if this failed test involved one of those engines.'"}, "time": 1742564424.08929}
