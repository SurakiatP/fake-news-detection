The woman, Carmen Irizarry, had been the   \u2019s legal guardian for years, a   for the girl\u2019s troubled mother. Now, Heaven\u2019s protector was sick, breathing from an oxygen tank after a long hospital stay for acute lung disease. It was early in the morning of May 11, quiet in the   in the   apartment in the South Bronx. Just before 5 a. m. Henry Maldonado, Ms. Irizarry\u2019s companion of 30 years, entered the room clutching a chef\u2019s knife, the police said. In a fury, he thrust the knife at Heaven, then at Ms. Irizarry, back and forth, the blade cutting five times into Heaven\u2019s torso and left leg. Her grandmother tried to block the blows. \u201cHeaven,\u201d she said, \u201cgo!\u201d Those were Ms. Irizarry\u2019s last words to her granddaughter, the girl told the police, and they very likely saved her from joining the grim tally of children killed by the people closest to them. In a city that has seen murder rates fall to historic lows, such deaths remain a stubborn strain of violence, one that too often has also exposed lapses in the child welfare system. In the most notorious of those cases, caseworkers missed persistent signs of physical abuse and children later died, inciting outrage and prompting reforms. The signs in Heaven Irizarry\u2019s case were subtler in that her home was typical of many troubled households that child welfare workers encounter. She was loved, and had a solid guardian, but she was also surrounded by people addicted to drugs and entangled in the criminal justice system. Determining whether she was in danger was not a simple task. Two days after Heaven was born, her mother, Brenda Irizarry, handed the newborn over to her own mother. She had little choice: She was bound for prison on a parole violation, and child welfare officials were inquiring about the baby. That day in August 2006 was the first of three encounters New York City\u2019s child welfare agency would have with the family. Each time, caseworkers either missed or discounted Mr. Maldonado\u2019s history of domestic violence and drug abuse. Had she not escaped, Heaven might well have been the victim of the eighth murder recorded this year in the 40th Precinct, where The New York Times is reporting on every killing logged in 2016. Instead, it was her    grandmother whose name was recorded that morning. Since then, the precinct has endured several more homicides, and it now has 14 for the year, more than all but one other precinct in the city. As her grandmother crumbled under the knife strikes, Heaven ran barefoot out the door, blood soaking her pink nightie. Up two flights of steps, she went to an apartment directly above her grandmother\u2019s at 700 East 156th Street in the St. Mary\u2019s Park Houses. Loretta Fleming opened the door and Heaven stumbled in, hysterical. \u201cMy grandfather went crazy,\u201d the girl said. Ms. Fleming, who often babysat for Heaven, called 911. Below, she could hear Mr. Maldonado knocking things over, breaking glass. \u201cYou are going to die,\u201d she heard him scream. Then she smelled smoke. Mr. Maldonado, 55, was putting a lighter to papers and clothes, the police said. He had plunged the   knife into Ms. Irizarry more than two dozen times, breaking off the haft. Then he stabbed himself twice in the chest with a steak knife. Firefighters broke down the door and doused the flames. Officers used a stun gun to subdue Mr. Maldonado. When Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, interviewed Mr. Maldonado eight days later in the burn unit at Jacobi Medical Center, he said all that he could remember was that he had tried to kill himself. Told that Ms. Irizarry had been hurt, Mr. Maldonado said he wanted a lawyer. Then he asked if Heaven was all right. \u201cI said, \u2018She\u2019s fine, but you stabbed her five times,\u2019\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo recalled. \u201cSo he goes, \u2018What about my wife?\u2019 I just shook my head. He goes, \u2018What does that mean?\u2019 I said, \u2018She died and you killed her. \u2019\u201d In hindsight, there were clues that despite Ms. Irizarry\u2019s evident devotion to Heaven, the girl lived amid perilous instability, exposed to her mother\u2019s   lifestyle and Mr. Maldonado\u2019s violent mood swings. \u201cThis defendant has a history of violence against the deceased,\u201d a Bronx assistant district attorney, Felicity Lung, said at a court hearing in June after Mr. Maldonado was charged with murder in Ms. Irizarry\u2019s death. A year before Heaven was born, Mr. Maldonado attacked Ms. Irizarry on two consecutive days, once with his fists and once with a machete. He barred the door and cut the phone line during the second rampage, according to court records and interviews with witnesses. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault. Two years later, in October 2007, child welfare workers determined that Ms. Irizarry\u2019s home was safe for her granddaughter when they conducted a   home study, after Ms. Irizarry had filed a petition for custody of Heaven. At the time, the agency could not readily examine criminal records. The court, relying on the caseworker\u2019s report, appointed Ms. Irizarry the child\u2019s legal guardian. Heaven\u2019s father, who could not be located for comment, has not played a role in her life and never sought custody, several relatives said. Eight years later, the agency again investigated the family after Brenda Irizarry, Heaven\u2019s mother, who lived in the apartment for long periods, assaulted a woman with a baseball bat as Heaven looked on. Ms. Irizarry pleaded guilty in September 2015 to   attempted assault, but was not sentenced to serve any time. Again, caseworkers determined that Carmen Irizarry was a competent guardian, even though she sometimes left the child with her daughter, two people familiar with the case said. That time, the caseworkers raised questions with teachers at Public School 157. Why had Heaven missed more than 10 days of school in the second grade? Her attendance worsened the next year, when she missed 26 as her grandmother\u2019s health failed yet her teachers had never alerted child welfare officials, the people familiar with the case said. The city\u2019s Education Department, citing privacy laws, declined to comment on why Heaven\u2019s absences had not prompted a call to the authorities. Friends said Susie Irizarry  \u2014   as the grandmother was known to them  \u2014   was a vigilant guardian who doted on Heaven, and city officials confirm that there was never a complaint that Heaven was physically abused. In practice, Ms. Irizarry was not the only one watching Heaven. She worked long hours as a counselor for disabled adults and came home late most nights, neighbors and relatives said. It was Mr. Maldonado, or Heaven\u2019s mother, who often cared for the girl after school. And a couple of afternoons a week, Heaven would stay with Ms. Fleming, the neighbor to whom she would flee the night her grandmother was killed. Brenda Irizarry, 44, has been arrested nine times since 2013, on charges including prostitution, petty larceny and drug possession. Henry Maldonado has at least 15 arrests dating back to 1984, on assorted charges, including carrying a knife, drug possession and armed robbery. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to selling pills he had obtained with Medicaid benefits to a black market drug dealer. In addition, a man who lived with Ms. Fleming, and who occasionally accompanied Heaven and Brenda Irizarry on outings to the park or the beach, was a sex offender who had served 21 years in connection with the rape and robbery of a    girl, law enforcement officials said. A year ago, the man, Morgan Shuler, 53, whose nickname was Moet, was arrested again, on charges that he had raped a woman in Heaven\u2019s building. He pleaded not guilty. \u201cMoet loved Heaven,\u201d Ms. Fleming said. Since the murder, Heaven has been placed in the temporary custody of Mr. Maldonado\u2019s estranged son, Henry Jr. who is seeking permanent custody, relatives said. The girl\u2019s physical wounds have healed, and she is thriving in a new home and school in the North Bronx, law enforcement officials said. She attended a dance and gymnastics camp over the summer. The family took her   rafting in Pennsylvania and on a Florida vacation. For the first time in her life, Heaven has her own bed. Henry Maldonado pleaded not guilty at his court arraignment in June. His lawyer, Martin Goldberg, has not yet indicated whether he intends to offer a psychiatric defense. Gladys Carri\u00f3n, the commissioner of the city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services, said state law precluded her from saying whether caseworkers had been aware of Mr. Maldonado\u2019s previous attack on Ms. Irizarry or knew of the criminal backgrounds of other people in Heaven\u2019s orbit. The agency does not ask the courts to put children in foster care solely because there are drug addicts or people with criminal records in a home, Ms. Carri\u00f3n said. Indeed, many families the agency monitors in the South Bronx struggle with a combination of those problems. \u201cWe\u2019d be removing many, many more children,\u201d she said. Ms. Carri\u00f3n said it was difficult for caseworkers to know about every person caring for a child. Investigations focus on the primary caregiver, in this case Carmen Irizarry, she said. The agency turns to foster care only as a last resort, usually in cases of physical abuse, molestation or extreme neglect, the commissioner said. \u201cOur work is not an exact science,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way to be able to predict 100 percent of the time what could happen, and when something could happen, and when is the right time to intervene. \u201d It is impossible to separate Mr. Maldonado from his daily landscape of methadone clinics, pill mills,   drug purchases and furtive highs in parks, alleys and stairwells. He was well known on the commercial strip of 149th Street near Third Avenue, with his long, graying hair pulled back in a ponytail, his \u201cDeath Before Dishonor\u201d patch, the heavy rings on every finger, a cane in one hand, a knife in his pocket. \u201cOutlaw forever, forever outlaw\u201d was how he described himself on Facebook. Heroin and opioid abuse have swept into suburban and rural areas of the country, but the scourge has long devastated the South Bronx, where Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Irizarry lived. More people die of heroin and opioid overdoses in the Bronx than anywhere else in the city the rate exceeds 22 per 100, 000 residents. Few areas have as many methadone clinics as the Mott Haven and Melrose neighborhoods in the 40th Precinct. Mr. Maldonado had been an addict for decades, and he went daily to a methadone clinic on East 138th Street. Methadone treatment is intended to curb the craving for heroin, but the clinics also tend to be gathering spots for less resolute addicts who often lead one another to backslide, addiction experts said. After taking his dose, Mr. Maldonado would typically spend days stalking his next high: pills, PCP, cocaine and, once in a while, heroin, relatives and fellow addicts said. \u201cHe had a very bad drug problem,\u201d his daughter, Evita Maldonado, said. \u201cHe would take whatever he can get his hands on. \u201d His heavy drug use had started in the early 1980s, around the time he met Ms. Irizarry in a salsa club near Bristow and Jennings Streets. Her name in those days was Carmen Rodriguez. She had been briefly married in the 1970s to Brenda\u2019s father, Harry Irizarry, and kept his surname. Ms. Irizarry loved to dance, many of her friends recalled. Mr. Maldonado, who then went by the nickname Dee Jay, ran with young men who called themselves the Cool Brothers and provided security for clubs. Their relationship was tempestuous and revolved around drinking, drugs and nightclubs, friends said. \u201cHenry was kind of a wild man,\u201d said Jimmy Soriano, a friend from those days. \u201cThey used to get high like there was a shortage of drugs or something. \u201d Mr. Maldonado had a melodramatic streak and was quick to take offense, friends said. During one argument with Ms. Irizarry, while he was high on PCP, he lay in the street and asked someone to drive a car over him. Ms. Irizarry, too, fought addictions, to alcohol and crack cocaine. While she eventually won the struggle in the early 1990s, after the birth of her two younger daughters, Mr. Maldonado fell back into drug use again and again, storming out of   meetings. \u201cHe was like a stick of dynamite,\u201d said Claude Hernandez, one of his counselors. In the early 1990s, Mr. Maldonado tried to jump off a roof and was hospitalized at Harlem Hospital, his lawyer, Mr. Goldberg, said. Another time, he tried to hang himself at St. Barnabas Hospital while undergoing detoxification. He never found the strength to quit, fellow addicts say. And when he was high, neighbors said, he often fought with Ms. Irizarry. \u201cThey were always arguing,\u201d said Joy T. Madison, who lived below the couple for 15 years. \u201cHe was always drinking and drugging. Then he\u2019d come home and pick a fight with her. \u201d The criminal justice system did little to help. Most of his offenses were reduced to misdemeanors, and Mr. Maldonado spent no time in state prison and only a few days in jail. Judges sometimes sentenced him to anger counseling or community service, but he was never compelled to enter drug treatment as part of a plea deal, court records show. In addition to using illegal drugs, he spent many days visiting doctors at three clinics. A psychiatrist at one prescribed him   and tranquilizers for bipolar disorder, said Mr. Goldberg, his lawyer. He was also seeing an anesthesiologist for back and knee pain. The treatment for those, Mr. Goldberg said, was more drugs: opioid pills and injections. Still, several of Mr. Maldonado\u2019s friends said they could never have predicted that he would attack Ms. Irizarry and Heaven. He was often seen hugging and kissing Ms. Irizarry. He also seemed to revel in his role as grandfather, doting on Heaven and walking her to school. \u201cTo do what he did, he must have been in another world,\u201d a close friend and fellow addict, Carlos Nu\u00f1ez, said. \u201cI still, to this day, cannot see it happening. \u201d Yet several friends said there were clear signs that Mr. Maldonado was falling apart in April, amid Ms. Irizarry\u2019s illness. After a lifetime of smoking, she collapsed last November with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Five months later, she stopped breathing for a time and spent weeks at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center. While she lay in intensive care, Mr. Maldonado stepped up his use of illicit drugs and stopped taking   medication, friends and relatives said. He was smoking PCP and spoke of suicide. \u201cHe was bugging out,\u201d Mr. Nu\u00f1ez recalled. His grief proved violent. A neighbor who tried to visit Heaven\u2019s mother, Brenda, in April said Mr. Maldonado punched him and chased him away with a sword. The same month, Mr. Maldonado attacked his daughter Evita with a cane after she confronted him about his drug use, she said in an interview. He also complained bitterly about Brenda\u2019s presence in the apartment, blaming her for Ms. Irizarry\u2019s condition and threatening to kill her, friends said. In late April Ms. Irizarry left the hospital, weak and unable to work. She asked Brenda to move out. \u201cShe said that things were going to change,\u201d one of her closest friends, Nilsa Rivera, said. \u201cShe was not going to deal with anyone\u2019s negativity or addictions. \u201d Mr. Maldonado, who did odd jobs for cash and recently started receiving disability benefits, had to divert more of his income toward their bills. Heaven, in a   conversation with Detective Javier Cordero, said Mr. Maldonado screamed, \u201cNo more bills,\u201d as he attacked her and her grandmother. The night before that attack, a neighbor said, he was agitated and   in the hall outside Ms. Irizarry\u2019s apartment. \u201cYou could see the stress on his face,\u201d the neighbor, Steven Ocasio, said. \u201cHe said, \u2018My demons is out tonight. \u2019\u201d Mr. Goldberg, the defense lawyer, said Mr. Maldonado denied that he smoked PCP that evening. But he said that in the   hours, Mr. Maldonado had taken prescription drugs, among them Seroquel, Xanax, Ambien and OxyContin. \u201cThis was a suicide attempt,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said. In the end, however, it was not Mr. Maldonado who died, but Ms. Irizarry. In a sense, she was a victim of her faith in him, the couple\u2019s youngest daughter, Angelica Rosado, said. \u201cShe never gave up on him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628559.6836867}
