Women experience a notable decline in sexual function and sex drive approximately 20 months before and one year after their last menstrual period, and that decrease continues, though at a somewhat slower rate, over the following five years, according to a study led by a researcher at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center . Of note, in the natural menopause group the researchers found that race/ethnicity played a major role in the decline of sexual function, with African-American women experiencing a significantly smaller sex drive decline and women of Japanese descent experiencing a much greater decline when compared with white women. Key Sex Drive Study Findings \\nThe study, published ahead of print in the online issue of Menopause: The Journal of the North American Menopause Society , also found that various factors that frequently co-occur with menopause have less direct influence on declining sex drive and sexual function than menopause itself. \\n\u201cSexual functioning in women declines with age, and there has been much debate about how much this is due to menopause, aging or other physical, psychological or social factors,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Nancy Avis, Ph.D., professor of public health sciences at Wake Forest School of Medicine, part of Wake Forest Baptist. \u201cOur findings support that menopause has a negative effect on sexual functioning in many women.\u201d \\nAdditionally, the study found that women who have a hysterectomy before the onset of menopause do not experience a marked decline in sexual function and sex drive immediately before undergoing the procedure but do so afterward, for as long as five years. \\nCommon issues known to accompany menopause, such as vaginal dryness, depression, and anxiety, didn\u2019t explain the impact on sex drive, the researchers say. \\n\u201cSexual functioning is an important component of women\u2019s lives. More than 75 percent of the middle-aged women in the SWAN study reported that sex was moderately to extremely important to them when the study began,\u201d Avis said. \u201cIt is important for women and their health care providers to understand all the factors that may impact women\u2019s experience of sex in relation to both the natural menopausal transition and hysterectomy, and we hope our findings will contribute to better understanding in this area.\u201d A 31 Year Old Was Sick Of Expensive Rent And High Costs.
