But it has also raised another fraught question: Is our national anthem itself racist? The journalist Jon Schwarz, writing in The Intercept, argued yes, denouncing the lyrics, written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812, as \u201ca celebration of slavery. \u201d How could black players, Mr. Schwarz asked, be expected to stand for a song whose rarely sung third stanza  \u2014   which includes the lines \u201cNo refuge could save the hireling and   the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave\u201d  \u2014   \u201cliterally celebrates the murder of  \u201d? That argument drew outrage from some conservative news outlets, as well as a more scholarly rebuttal from Mark Clague, a musicologist at the University of Michigan and the founding board chairman of the Star Spangled Music Foundation. We spoke with Mr. Clague, who is writing a book about the song, about the anthem\u2019s history and shifting meanings. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. Why do you think those who call the song racist are wrong? The social context of the song comes from the age of slavery, but the song itself isn\u2019t about slavery, and it doesn\u2019t treat whites differently from blacks. The reference to slaves is about the use, and in some sense the manipulation, of black Americans to fight for the British, with the promise of freedom. The American forces included   as well as whites. The term \u201cfreemen,\u201d whose heroism is celebrated in the fourth stanza, would have encompassed both. Few people know \u201cThe   Banner\u201d has a third verse, since it was often left out of   sheet music publications. Why?  I don\u2019t think people were afraid of offending   but of offending the British. It was their blood that \u201chas wash\u2019d out their foul footstep\u2019s pollution,\u201d as the third verse puts it. But when we became allies in World War I, we really started reversing course. Part of the difficulty of parsing the anthem seems to that Americans know so little about the War of 1812. Why is public understanding so murky?  It\u2019s something in our history we would probably rather skip over. Nobody won, nobody lost. The British burned down the White House. We invaded Canada. It was sort of a bizarre war. But while it didn\u2019t really change much, it was pivotal as far as American identity went. The naval buildup really created the modern American national state. That\u2019s part of the reason why \u201cThe   Banner\u201d seems so natural and true and permanent and sacred to us today. It didn\u2019t really describe America in 1814, when Key wrote his lyrics, but it was a vision of the unified power the country would become. For your project \u201cPoets  Patriots,\u201d you tracked down around 100 different sets of lyrics written by others. How do these alternate versions help us understand the meaning of the song? There are versions that talk about temperance, about women\u2019s suffrage, about presidential campaigns, including Abraham Lincoln\u2019s. The one I wish everyone knew about was one about abolition from 1844, beginning \u201cOh say, do you hear   \u2026     \u201d It repeats Key\u2019s phrase \u201cthe land of the free\u201d but as an ironic statement. I wish teachers would contrast that version with Key\u2019s, as a way of showing how singing the anthem isn\u2019t a mindless, rote ritual, but part of a long history of exploration of what the country is about. Does that same kind of revision go on today?  By the 20th century, we were treating the anthem as a religious hymn, and it became counterproductive to alter the lyrics as social commentary since changes to the anthem tend to make people so upset. In the 20th century, commentary became less about the lyrics than about the performance. Take Jimi Hendrix\u2019s version. It was a combination of patriotism and protest. Here you have an   man, speaking largely to white youth but really to all youth, about their own potential to create the country at a moment when they were old enough to be drafted, but not necessarily old enough to vote. What do you see as the most important part of the anthem?  For me, it\u2019s the punctuation that ends the part we sing. After \u201cland of the free,\u201d we have a question mark, not an exclamation point. Is the flag and what it represents still there? Are we winning the battle for freedom that this country was founded on? That\u2019s where Colin Kaepernick has started a productive conversation. If there are people who don\u2019t feel the song represents them, we need to pay attention to that. But if we just reject the song as racist, or declare that it isn\u2019t our anthem anymore, we don\u2019t fix the problem.'"}, "time": 1742563736.0449748}
