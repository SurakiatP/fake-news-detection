That \u201csituation involved a private individual who was run off the road by protesters,\u201d the department said in a Facebook post. \\nThe 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, being built by a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners LP, would offer the fastest and most direct route to bring Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. \\nSupporters say it would be safer and more cost-effective than transporting the oil by road or rail. \\nBut the pipeline has drawn the ire of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental activists who say it threatens the water supply and sacred tribal sites. They have been protesting for several months, and dozens have been arrested. \\nIn all, 141 people were arrested on various charges including conspiracy to endanger by fire or explosion, engaging in a riot and maintaining a public nuisance, the sheriff\u2019s department said. \\nNative American protesters had occupied the site since Monday, saying they were the land\u2019s rightful owners under an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government. \\nVideo posted on social media showed dozens of police and two armored vehicles slowly approaching one group of protesters. \\nReuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video, which showed a helicopter overhead as some protesters said police had used bean-bag guns in an effort to chase them out of the camp. \\nNorth Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said police were successful in clearing the camp. \\n\u201cPrivate property is not the place to carry out a peaceful protest,\u201d he said. \\nMembers of the Standing Rock Sioux asked Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday to oppose the pipeline. She has not taken a public position on the issue.'"}, "time": 1742561952.5748694}
