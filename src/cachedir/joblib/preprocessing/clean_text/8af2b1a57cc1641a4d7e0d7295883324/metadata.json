Ryan Grim wrote: \u201cHuffPost Pollster is giving Clinton a 98 percent chance of winning, and The New York Times\u2019 model at The Upshot puts her chances at 85 percent.\u201d \\n\u201cThere is one outlier, however, that is causing waves of panic among Democrats around the country and injecting Trump backers with the hope that their guy might pull this thing off after all. Nate Silver\u2019s 538 model gives Donald Trump a heart-stopping 35% chance of winning as of this weekend.\u201d \\nThe Huffington Post went as far as accusing Silver of \u201cmaking a mockery of the very forecasting industry that he popularized.\u201d \\nIn perspectives, Nate Silver and his 538 were obviously spot on. The Huffington Post and The New York Times were totally off the mark. Is it a coincidence? \\nHow is it possible that the Democratic Party, the mainstream media and Wall Street have managed to totally miss the level of anger that unites the American masses. These questions go far beyond polling strategy or the science of statistics. We are dealing with a state of being aloof on the verge of total detachment. \\nLeft and progressive thinking is shaped like a dream. It tells us what the world ought to be. Progressives often seem to forget what the world really is and what its people are really like. Hillary Clinton and her campaign, just like the New York Times and The Huffington Post, were in a state of denial. Boasting in righteous hubris, they failed to read the map. \\nBut this shouldn\u2019t take us by a complete surprise. Detachment wasn\u2019t invented by Clinton and her team. Detachment and alienation are ingrained in progressive thought. To be a progressive is to believe that some of the \u2018other\u2019 people are simply a bunch of unaware \u2018reactionaries.\u2019 Progressive thought is the secular manifestation of \u2018chosenness.\u2019 It is inherently Jewish, a fact that explains why Hillary Clinton\u2019s top five donors were Jewish billionaires . \\nSince being progressive is a form of supremacy. I would go as far as suggesting that progressives\u2019 antagonism towards \u2018white supremacy,\u2019 is at large, a form of projection. The progressive attributes to \u2018whiteness\u2019 his own exceptionalist inclinations. \\nAmericans vs. Identitarians \\nOn election day, we learned that the Democratic Party was hanging on a thread, hoping to be saved by Florida\u2019s \u2018Hispanic vote.\u2019 Clinton\u2019s political future depended upon the hope that Trump had managed to upset enough Latinos. This peculiar development in which a national party is dependent on group politics shouldn\u2019t take us by surprise anymore. \\nThe 2016 American presidential election divided America into two camps: The Americans on one side and the Identitarians on the other. The Americans are those who see themselves primarily as American patriots. They are driven by rootedness and heritage. For them, the promise to make \u2018America great again\u2019 confirms that Utopia is nostalgia and that the progressive reality is nothing short of dystopia. The Identitarians, on the other hand, are those who subscribe to progressive sectarian politics. They see themselves primarily as LGBTQ, Latino, Black, Jews, Women, and so on. Their bond with the American national or patriotic ethos is secondary and often non-existent. The future of the Democratic Party, in its current form, depends upon the hope that American subscriptions to sectarian ideologies will gradually increase and, as a result, will eventually strengthen the context of identity or group politics. The progressive agenda banks on the divestiture of the national and patriotic ethos. Needless to mention that half of America voted for Clinton. Hence, this political agenda is far from being farfetched or delusional. \\nBut the Identitarian agenda backfired. It was only a question of time before the so-called \u2018whites\u2019 or \u2018rednecks\u2019 grasped that their backs have been pressed to the wall. They also started to act and think as an identitarian political sector. Hillary Clinton calling Trump\u2019s voters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d was a clear sign for white poor Americans that Hillary wasn\u2019t exactly their ally. However, Hillary was far from being alone. Almost every Jewish writer within the American press didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to attribute the \u201cWhite Supremacist\u201d label to Trump\u2019s voters. For Cheryl Greenberg, Trump\u2019s popularity was \u201cthe final gasping of white supremacy.\u201d For T alking Points Memo\u2019s Josh Marshall , Trump\u2019s closing ad was packed with \u201canti-Semitic dog whistles, anti-Semitic tropes, and anti-Semitic vocabulary.\u201d For Marshall and Goldberg, half of the American people were dogs obeying their master\u2019s whistle. \\nIt shouldn\u2019t take us by surprise that half of the American people would eventually react. They became weary of Jewish progressives like Marshall and Goldberg seeing them as dogs and white supremacists. The time was ripe for a revolution. \\nSo is the revolution here? I\u2019m not holding my breath. The people who crowned Trump are certainly exhausted. They are ready for a change. Can Trump introduce such a change? No one knows. He is certainly going to keep us entertained. \\nGilad Atzmon is an Israeli jazz musician, author and political activist.
