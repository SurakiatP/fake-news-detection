Bernie Sanders in March. ( Michael Vadone / CC 2.0 ) \\nDon\u2019t believe the hype about millennial voters. This bloc of the Unites States population, ages 18 to 35 and whose numbers are estimated to be about 69.2 million, may have a reputation for not engaging with the political system \u2014but that is not the case for this election, The Intelligence Group reports, based on a recent study. \\n\u201cLeading up to the presidential election, millennials are taking advantage of their hacking mindset to create their own persuasion journey to get to the truth,\u201d The Intelligence Group, a part of global marketing agency Deep Focus, which performs research for corporations and government organizations, states in a report that quotes numerous millennial voters. \\nThis subset of the electorate will play an important role at the ballot box, and its members are doing their homework. \\n\u201cThe media is a joke,\u201d said Joseph, 31, a moderate in the study. \u201cI research things much more. I Google the topic, and then I sift through a bunch of media spin to try and see if it\u2019s true or not.\u201d \\nThe group\u2019s research, conducted through \u201ca blended approach of social listening and qualitative insights generated via real-time social conversations,\u201d found millennials fact-checking the presidential candidates\u2019 assertions and engaging with their peers on social media sites and forums such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook to \u201cmake an informed opinion and hold candidates accountable.\u201d \\nDuring the first presidential debate, for example, The Intelligence Group reported that Americans posted 138,000 tweets to fact-check the candidates in real time. This eagerness to critically assess the candidates stems from a distrust of both media and the candidates themselves. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is such a thing as a truly objective source,\u201d said Kelly, 25, a liberal. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the individual to factor in the relative objectivity of a source when making their opinion.\u201d \\nThe millennial vote is an increasingly significant one. This year, data show that millennials already match the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) as the largest voting-age group in America, according to the Pew Research Center. Census Bureau data show that roughly 1 in 6 voters in the past two presidential elections were younger than 30. \\nThe presidential campaigns have taken note of these numbers, \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d to target millennials, according to Kristin Lynch, communications coordinator for the Clinton campaign in Denver. Clinton\u2019s team referred to social media and, specifically, Facebook Live, as crucial to reaching young voters. \\n\u201c[Trump] is really facing an uphill battle when people are only hearing what the media is saying,\u201d Rachel Keane, the Trump campaign\u2019s Colorado millennial outreach co-chairwoman, told USA Today. \\nIn the 2012 election, President Obama won over millennials by a landslide against rival Mitt Romney, garnering 60 percent of the youth vote. \\n\u201cIf millennials vote en masse, they have a chance to determine the election\u2019s outcome ,\u201d writes Courtney Crowder of the Des Moines Register. \\nThe next big question is whether they will be motivated enough to actually vote.'"}, "time": 1742563213.7296572}
