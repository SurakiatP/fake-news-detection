She realizes it\u2019s a big ask. \u201cIt\u2019d be hard to know if even within a lifetime of friendship some of these topics on the questionnaire would be tackled,\u201d Feist wrote in an email, promising discretion. \u201cThey\u2019re just the things I\u2019d most like to know. \u201d It\u2019s true that the survey is an accurate indicator of where Feist\u2019s head is lately  \u2014   \u201cPleasure,\u201d her first LP in six years, is concerned with similarly lofty themes and broad questions, with the music serving as her version of an answer. \u201cHere I am living in my life,\u201d she said, \u201cand songs occur to help me make sense of it. \u201d Epiphanies are not the point. \u201cI know less now than I ever did about how life is supposed to go. It\u2019s relaxing. \u201d This is the   state of a singer, now 41, who has rejected a kind of fame that did not suit her in favor of a more personal version of her own making. A decade removed from \u201c1234,\u201d the accidental midcareer hit that altered the course of her life (but not her music) Feist has turned further inward with \u201cPleasure,\u201d which was inspired by a short    solo tour in 2014. The album is largely just her singular voice and guitar, but it pummels with intimacy and tape hiss as raw whispers turn to wails and tinny riffs clang until they break. Across two long walks in February and March  \u2014   one in Central Park as spring tried to prematurely bloom, and another in the sunny mountains above Los Angeles  \u2014   Feist was voluble and loose, prone to discursive reveries even as she described the personal turmoil and uncertainty that led to this knotty, taxing album. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sad times lately,\u201d she said, speaking somewhat abstractly to avoid revealing their roots, while parsing the decision to put \u201ca word that so doesn\u2019t seem to fit\u201d at the forefront of her new work, which hardly oozes joy. (\u201cPleasure\u201d is also the album\u2019s first song and single.) \u201cIt\u2019s such an inaccurate,   word that, in fact, when you look a little closer, it carries in it yearning and loss and \u201d she said. \u201cPleasure is implicit in pain, which is implicit in pleasure. \u201d The producer Mocky, who has worked with Feist on her last three albums, said the goal of the sessions  \u2014   \u201cPleasure\u201d was recorded mostly live, three times in three different locations  \u2014   was to \u201cbe more vulnerable than you\u2019ve been before. \u201d Amid the success of \u201cThe Reminder,\u201d her 2007 album that featured \u201c1234,\u201d Feist took on a rather inaccurate reputation for   tweeness through her most widespread songs (see also: \u201cMushaboom,\u201d \u201cI Feel It All\u201d). But with \u201cMetals\u201d in 2011, she shook off any lingering commercial expectations, recasting her ambitions with more complex songwriting draped in grand, intricate musical layers. This time around, following that palate cleanser, she tore it all down. \u201cIf you came to \u2018Metals\u2019 looking for \u20181234,\u2019 you didn\u2019t find it,\u201d Mocky said. \u201cJust when you thought you had that maneuver clocked, now with this, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you thought that was a hard left?\u2019 No, no, that wasn\u2019t a hard left at all. This is a hard left. \u201d New songs like \u201cLost Dreams\u201d and \u201cCentury\u201d are borderline crude with shame and despair, while the minimalist instrumentation leaves Feist\u2019s tender melodies and often gutting lyrics unadorned. \u201cI felt some certainty that you must have   how could I live if you\u2019re still alive?\u201d she sings on \u201cI Wish I Didn\u2019t Miss You. \u201d \u201cIt can feel heavier than metal when you\u2019re by yourself, because you can make so little seem like so much,\u201d Feist said of the stark arrangements, which she called \u201cthe natural reflection of my state of mind. \u201d The album may have started from a place of loneliness, but it landed at \u201cpotent, positive solitude,\u201d she said, stressing the difference. In person, Feist\u2019s sprightly demeanor does not betray her inner burdens leave her alone for a moment, and you might return to find her practicing \u201cSilent Night\u201d on a harmonica, giggling knowingly at the absurdity of the scene. There are lighter moments on the album, too  \u2014   attempts to mitigate her own \u201cpropensity to swing like a pendulum to extremes,\u201d said Feist, who has sparred with \u201cclassic, constant   depression and anxiety,\u201d an affliction she called \u201cso boring. \u201d The soft and dreamy \u201cGet Not High, Get Not Low\u201d is a reminder to herself, while on the relatively optimistic album closer \u201cYoung Up,\u201d she reassures a past self, \u201cYoung buck, the end\u2019s not coming. \u201d These songs came to her at a time when making another album was not a foregone conclusion. \u201cI was completely open to the idea that I might focus on something else for a while,\u201d Feist said. She watched a lot of \u201cNashville,\u201d traveled and read extensively, and even took up woodworking  \u2014   making benches, bed frames, a screen porch  \u2014   inspired in part by John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cJournal of a Novel,\u201d the letters he kept while writing \u201cEast of Eden. \u201d Long a nomad, having leapfrogged for years among Toronto, Paris, Berlin and now Los Angeles, Feist also collects, in a classic bohemian sense, what she calls \u201caspirational people,\u201d though never for wealth or power. There\u2019s the older playwright with access to   real estate, the musical neuroscientist with theories on pleasure, the   busker aspiring to art therapy and the Beckett actress, each with jewels of arcane knowledge to be gleaned. \u201c   Leslie felt   to be in a band with her friends  \u2014   she decided what I\u2019m doing with the rest of my life?\u201d Feist pondered. \u201cI just took a minute to see if any other lightning would strike me  \u2014   a different moment, a different era. \u201d Of songwriting, she explained, \u201cI wanted to make sure it was a legitimate drive, coming from a really honest and humble place, not because it\u2019s what I do. \u201d She added: \u201cOf course I worked really hard, but it\u2019s been completely built on a zeitgeist and luck and timing. I didn\u2019t want to keep just plunking quarters in the meter as if I owe it something  \u2014   or as if it owes me something. It had to be a legitimate exchange. And it turned out it was. \u201d Though she set out to make the album alone, Feist eventually welcomed in Renaud Letang, a longtime collaborator, and Mocky as  . Their job was \u201cto get out of the way,\u201d Mocky said. \u201cShe was really owning every note, every decision. \u201d Such artistic possessiveness may have stemmed from a perceived loss of control around the success of \u201c1234\u201d  \u2014   a song she did not even write  \u2014   which snowballed from an iPod commercial to \u201cSesame Street,\u201d the pop charts and the Grammys, where Feist was nominated for best new artist in 2008 alongside Taylor Swift and Amy Winehouse. \u201cI felt like a lot of expectations had grown up around me that had not much to do with me,\u201d Feist said. \u201cMy goal was to just very carefully descend the ladder with dignity, and go back to the altitude that I can breathe at. \u201d Still, surrounding \u201cMetals,\u201d \u201cI was much too aware of the external side of things,\u201d a distraction she was finally able to shake for \u201cPleasure,\u201d she said. Having \u201caccidentally achieved autonomy,\u201d with consistent sales and touring revenue, \u201cI actually finished making this album before we told the label that we\u2019d made it. \u201d This release will also coincide with a return to an earlier chapter in Feist\u2019s career: playing with the Canadian supergroup Broken Social Scene, which has a new album planned for summer. \u201cMy only caveat going in was I want to actually contribute  \u2014   I can\u2019t commit if I\u2019m just singing oohs and aahs,\u201d said Feist, who wrote one song for the project and contributed to about six others. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I was a part of the last couple of records  \u2014   I can\u2019t actually remember. Certainly I didn\u2019t bring myself to the table like I just did for this song. \u201d Kevin Drew, the group\u2019s de facto leader and one of Feist\u2019s closest friends (as well as an ex) said: \u201cShe penned something stunning. Creatively, it couldn\u2019t have gone any better. \u201d Mr. Drew also recalled sitting in Feist\u2019s rehearsal space as she worked on her own album. \u201cI see the struggle of honesty,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding. \u201d It was laying her emotions so bare that allowed Feist some perspective on them. Climbing rocks in Central Park, she recalled the \u201cshanty hut\u201d on a raw Canadian island where she spends weeks during the summer, isolated and without electricity. \u201cBeing on that island, I found really concrete poetry,\u201d Feist said, comparing her moods to the storms that passed over the exposed landscape. \u201cI could see it coming, I would experience it, and then it would be gone. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562208.86079}
