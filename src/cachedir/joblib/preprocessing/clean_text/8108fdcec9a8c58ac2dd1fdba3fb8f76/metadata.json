She is Editor-in-Chief of VeteransNewsNow.com Her main focus are the US-Mid-East Conflicts. Her writing has been featured in several print and online publications in the Middle East. She is committed to exposing (AIPAC) the Israel Lobby's control of American policy for the Middle East. Control which amounts to treason by the Zionist Lobbies in America and its stooges in Congress, and that guarantees there can never be a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflicts, only catastrophe for all, in the region and the world. Her focus is Israel\u2019s drift towards greater oppression of the Palestinian people; the political deceptions and crisis in Syria and Ukraine; the cold hard facts about America\u2019s so-called \u2018war on terror\u2019 and grim future; countering the propaganda war towards Iran & Russia and calling attention to, the new, developing, promising, strategic alliances as a consequence. Her mission is to inform and educate the public on issues of the US/Middle East conflicts that are unreported, underreported, or distorted in the Zionist owned American Media. Her writing reflects the incredible resilience, almost superhuman steadfastness of the occupied and oppressed Palestinians, who are now facing the prospect of a final round of ethnic cleansing. Her mission is to inform and educate internet viewers seeking unfiltered information about real events on issues of the US/Middle East conflicts that are unreported, underreported, or distorted in the American media. Her purpose is to look at the current reality from a different and critical perspective, not to simply rehash the pro-US/Israel perspective, smoke and mirrors that has been allowed to utterly and completely dominate Mainstream discourse. PS: For those of her detractors that think she is being selective and even \u201cone sided,\u201d tough, that is the point of her work, to present an alternative view and interpretation of the US-Israel-Middle East conflict, that has been completely ignored in mainstream discourse and denied the US public. Oh, and she is not Muslim or Palestinian and not married to one either! She is practicing Roman catholic. Rep. Gowdy on impact of FBI\u2019s new Clinton inquiry By Debbie Menon on October 31, 2016 Rep. Trey Gowdy is a straight shooter. He shows a glimmer of hope. BRAVO! Senator Trey Gowdy is an American attorney, politician and former prosecutor. He currently serves as the U.S. Representative for South Carolina\u2019s 4th congressional district. \\nSenator Trey Gowdy is right, the timing is a direct and natural consequence of decisions Hillary made, period. \\nJim Comey\u2019s obligation is to the public. \\nSenator (Harry) Reid is simply \u201cjust another\u201d one of the political hacks who populate that massive brothel we call Capitol Hill. Senator Reid and others are aware of the treasonous and criminal nature of the Clintons. \\nLet\u2019s not divert and scapegoat Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband. Hillary Clinton is probably guilty of many things which have not surfaced as openly or as clearly, but Hillary is guilty as sin of malfeasance of office and negligence, for the very fact that she exposed her country\u2019s secrets to hackers, knowingly using a \u201cprivate server\u201d to conduct State Department business with the outside world and should be called to account for it. Period. Gowdy: Clinton wiped her private server clean \\nComey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. \\nIt is people like Bill & Hillary who have become \u201cToo Big to Fall\u201d and the basic problems and causes of the fundamental failures in US Government. Two of the major rotten apples in the barrel, and these are probably two of the most obvious who should be prosecuted not only as examples to the others, but for delivery of the justice which they have earned\u2026and which the citizens of America deserve! \\nInstead of rewarding them by returning them to the Oval office, they should be investigated, and they should be held accountable. Americans can live in a State of Law and Justice, or a State of suppression, injustice, corruption and subjugation to powerful politicians. It is their choice!\""}, "time": 1742563918.6584733}
