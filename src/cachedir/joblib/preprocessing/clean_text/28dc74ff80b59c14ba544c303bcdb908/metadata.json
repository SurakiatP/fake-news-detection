The small number represents only those who have publicly said they are transgender, and doesn\u2019t include soldiers who may be considering or beginning gender transition or those who don\u2019t yet want to make an official paperwork change. Gen. Mark Milley, chief of staff of the Army, said the key now is to educate the force, particularly commanders who will have to make decisions about soldiers in their units who request a gender change. \u201cIs the army ready? Well, we are educating ourselves, and we are trying to get ready,\u201d Milley said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re well-past the issue of debating and arguing about transgender. We are now into execution, to make sure the program is carried out with diligence, dignity, respect.\u201d Dignity and respect, eh? Do tell. So the US military is now of a mind that the Christian worldview is inherently anti -dignity and anti -respect. Anti-kittens, anti-rainbows, and anti-love, too, I\u2019m sure. That\u2019s how anti-Christ perspectives roll: They tar the Christian worldview (and the God whose Nature it reflects) as mean and evil. They make good evil and evil good. At least they try to anyway. [insert \u201c U! S! A! \u201d chant here] Now back to the AP article: The Pentagon policy took effect Oct. 1, and Army Secretary Eric Fanning approved the service\u2019s new transgender guidelines earlier this month. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced in June that he was ending the ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the military. Transgender troops are now able to receive medical care and begin changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon\u2019s personnel system. Next year, the military services will begin allowing transgender individuals to enlist, as long as they meet required standards and have been stable in their identified gender for 18 months. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring implementation closely, and everything we\u2019ve seen so far points to a military organization fully committed to treating everyone equally and providing medically necessary care to all troops, not just some,\u201d said Aaron Belkin, director of the California-based Palm Center, an independent research institute. \u201cMy conclusion, so far, is that implementation has proceeded smoothly and successfully.\u201d . . . Milley said the Army numbers so far are low, but the service doesn\u2019t track the number of soldiers who may be starting the gender transition process. \u201cWe may not know the full scope yet,\u201d said Milley. \u201cOthers that may consider themselves as transgender but haven\u2019t self-identified publicly may be holding back because they want to see how things progress.\u201d \\nProgress. \\nThat\u2019s the name of the game, isn\u2019t it? \\nThe US Army is committed to progress. \\nExplicitly anti-Christian progress, of course. \\nThe US Army is at war. \\nWith God. \\nAnd His people. \\nThat\u2019s how these fights always end in God\u2019s cosmos. \\nThat\u2019s how they always unfold in His creations of time and history. \\nSo take heart, Christian. \\nEither way \u2013 whether through the beauty of a repentant and restored America being spared judgment and finding life again in loving, willful subjugation to Christ as King, or by way of King Jesus breaking yet another in a long line of unrepentant, proud, God-hating cultures to pieces under the weight of His unbreakable Law , His people always win and His Kingdom always advances\u2026all by His grace and all for His glory. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Fire Breathing Christian shares'"}, "time": 1742564064.5544734}
