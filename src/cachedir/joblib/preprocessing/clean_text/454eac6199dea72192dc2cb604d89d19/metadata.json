He was the former vice chairman of Soros\u2019 Investment Funds and the deputy secretary general of the United Nations when he worked as Kofi Annan\u2019s chief of staff. \\nMalloch-Brown has also worked with consulting firms that have ties to Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and husband, Bill. He was an international partner with the Sawyer-Miller consulting firm, and he was also a senior adviser to FTI Consulting, which handled communications under contract for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 run for the presidency. \\nTop Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald is a Sawyer-Miller alum. Grunwald was in charge of the firm\u2019s communication contract for former President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential run.
