Struck by Margaret\u2019s beauty, Somerset proposed a scheme to Margaret \u2014 that she marry the young English King Henry VI, in exchange for the independence from English rule of the French regions of Anjou and Maine. England at the time had conquered and controlled various parts of northern France. \\nLong story short: Margaret the \u201cfair\u201d maiden of French Anjou would marry Henry VI and become Queen Margaret, who plotted and schemed with the Lancaster faction. \\nEven though the scene of the encounter of Somerset and Margaret was dimly lit and Margaret\u2019s face was partly obscured by a hideous mop of long black hair, I could see what was wrong: Margaret was not a young maiden, but a middle-aged woman. History says Margaret of Anjou was 15 when she married King Henry VI, who was 23. ( Henry VI had become king when he was only 9 months old, upon the sudden death of his father, King Henry V.) Margaret was not fair or beautiful by any stretch of the imagination. Margaret was black, with stereotypical negroid features. \\n15-year-old Margaret of Anjou, France, was played by a 47-year-old actress \u2014 Sophie Okonedo , a British actress who was born in London of a Nigerian father and a Jewish mother. In an \u201cexclusive\u201d to the UK Express , May 6, 2016, Hollow Crown director Dominic Cooke explained the decision to cast Okonedo in \u201cwhat is considered to be a traditionally white role,\u201d saying that Okonedo was simply \u201cthe best person\u201d for the part: \\n\u201cWell, in the theatre we\u2019ve been doing this for donkeys years. I think Sophie is the best person in this country to play that part, I really do. Her visceral power and range is so extraordinary \u2013 that\u2019s what I was really looking for. It might be surprising for TV audiences to adjust to the idea that what they are watching is a myth, right. So it\u2019s the best actor and I know from the theatre that that works and I\u2019ve done it many, many times. I don\u2019t think that you can do a piece of work that is about who we are as a society and just have white people doing it. I hope that she is so brilliant in the part that that will be the thing people talk about in the end. I feel we should always be making sure that we\u2019re being open-minded, when making drama, about the casting possibilities. I think the sense of impatience there is in culture about all these issues is actually very healthy. You want the world you\u2019re showing on screen to reflect the world you\u2019re in and we live in a plural world, so our stories have to include the widest possible range of people.\u201d The reporter for the Express article writes: Sophie\u2019s casting comes at a time when the lack of ethnic minorities within the British film and television industry is being called into question. Recall that in the lead up to the 2016 Academy (Oscar) Awards, blacks in Hollywood complained that no blacks were nominated for an acting award. \\nJust you wait. \\nAny day now, there\u2019ll be a Hollyweird movie with a black actress playing Jacqueline Kennedy. And if you point out that Jackie was not black, but white, you\u2019ll be called . . . . \\nYou guessed it.'"}, "time": 1742562561.8070912}
