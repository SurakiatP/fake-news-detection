As both boss and head cheerleader, he was in his element. Mr. Daniels, though not officially directing that day in   was overseeing the filming of his new Fox series, \u201cStar,\u201d about a girl group clawing its way through Atlanta\u2019s booming music universe. Ms. Campbell\u2019s scene, a showdown between two disparate matriarchs over the fate of a young woman caught between worlds  \u2014   after an episode of police brutality  \u2014   had him charged up. \u201cIt\u2019s all fabulous,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cThe physical altercation\u201d  \u2014   between Ms. Campbell\u2019s character and one played by Queen Latifah  \u2014   \u201cis even better than I thought it was going to be. You see two different classes of black women, and yet the rich one pushes the poor one. So much privilege!\u201d It\u2019s exactly that blend of     social consciousness and histrionic soap opera that has driven Mr. Daniels\u2019s triumphs in film (\u201cPrecious,\u201d \u201cThe Butler\u201d) and television, where he scored big for Fox with the Shakespearean   melodrama \u201cEmpire,\u201d beginning in 2015. But while \u201cEmpire,\u201d now in its third season, relies on bombast and opulence, with a plot twist every few scenes  \u2014   \u201cDynasty\u201d and \u201cDallas\u201d by way of peak Puff Daddy and Bad Boy Records  \u2014   \u201cStar\u201d finds its creator returning to his earlier, grimier palette, including foster homes and addiction, for a slightly more earthbound tale. Still, the new show, part of Mr. Daniels\u2019s  \u201cEmpire\u201d production deal with Fox, will be expected to deliver in prime time the way its predecessor did. Its premiere in December, following the \u201cEmpire\u201d midseason finale, drew strong   viewership  \u2014   especially considering its leading trio of unknown actresses  \u2014   but starting with its second episode on Wednesday, Jan. 4, \u201cStar\u201d will be going it alone. (Adding pressure, \u201cEmpire,\u201d once a ratings juggernaut, has seen its impact wane recently, hitting viewership lows, though it remains the network\u2019s   cornerstone.) \u201cI\u2019m doomed,\u201d Mr. Daniels, uncensored and casual in luxurious black sweats, said playfully a few weeks before his set visit, during an interview at his Midtown Manhattan apartment. \u201cHollywood builds you up to take you down  \u2014   I\u2019ve learned that from many friends. \u201d Yet instead of returning victoriously to movies, particularly a   Richard Pryor biopic, Mr. Daniels was persuaded to double down on another network show about the music business, despite the mixed results of recent programming  \u2014   \u201cVinyl,\u201d \u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cThe Get Down\u201d  \u2014   set in the record industry. \u201cMy boyfriend said, \u2018On TV, more people will appreciate your work, even if it\u2019s not as potent, than on any film you ever do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Daniels recalled. He seemed unconcerned about competition. \u201cWhich one\u2019s \u2018The Get Down\u2019?\u201d Mr. Daniels asked. \u201cDo they sing in \u2018Atlanta\u2019?\u201d \u201cStar,\u201d which addresses Black Lives Matter and transgender issues in the first episode, also comes at a loaded moment politically. Mr. Daniels assumed, as he was sketching the   first season, that Hillary Clinton would win the presidency. He imagined the show\u2019s diverse girl group  \u2014   one poor and white, one rich and black, one of mixed race  \u2014   as an imperfect yet inspiring portrait of racial unity and healing. \u201cI was going to hit you with stings of \u2018this is what\u2019s going on in the streets,\u2019\u201d Mr. Daniels said. Now, instead of ratcheting up the politics under the coming administration of President Donald J. Trump, \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be more of a place of escape. \u201d He cited 1960s sitcoms like \u201cBewitched\u201d and \u201cI Dream of Jeannie\u201d as mass entertainment necessary in uncertain times. Even if he hopes to avoid positioning \u201cStar\u201d as a protest show, though, it still has progressive, confrontational themes at its core  \u2014   albeit expressed through Mr. Daniels\u2019s idiosyncratic lens. In casting Star, the title character, amid a period of racial tumult stemming from police shootings, Mr. Daniels said, \u201cI wanted to show a white girl that had some swag\u201d as \u201cpart of the healing process. \u201d He added: \u201cI wanted white people to feel cool. I wanted them to not be made fun of. We are one. \u201d He found his girl in Jude Demorest, a     performer from Detroit, with a pile of   ringlets and earrings the size of her face. The character, as written, \u201chad all but her Social Security number,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. Ms. Demorest agreed: \u201cIt was the first role where I never had to fake an accent or not wear my hoops to the audition or straighten my hair. \u201d (The show nods at racial dynamics in the industry, with one character joking, \u201ca white girl who can sing RB  \u2014   even the mediocre ones go platinum. \u201d) On the other hand, Mr. Daniels said he created Derek, the show\u2019s young Black Lives Matter activist played by Quincy Brown, as a message to his son, who had recently left what Mr. Daniels called his Upper West Side \u201cbubble\u201d and began experiencing   racism. \u201cStar,\u201d despite its modern   milieu, with original songs by a team including the longtime producer Rodney Jerkins that recall Rihanna and Fergie, is filled with other personal flourishes for Mr. Daniels, who said the show\u2019s essence was inspired by his time trying to break into Hollywood: \u201cWhat happens when you\u2019re young and na\u00efve, and you\u2019ll do anything to get to where you want to go?\u201d Queen Latifah, who plays Carlotta, a beautician and den mother to the singers, said: \u201cSo many parts of this take me back. I\u2019ve come full circle after starting as a hungry   wanting to get a deal and change the economic circumstances of my family. \u201d She also recalled seeing striving\u2019s ugly side  \u2014   \u201chow hungry people can be, selling their soul to have that success. \u201d The idea of using desperate, wily young women to tell a version of that story grew out of Mr. Daniels\u2019s childhood love of \u201cDreamgirls,\u201d which he said taught him that \u201cwe\u2019re from the \u2019hood and we can still be fabulous. \u201d Other influences included \u201cValley of the Dolls\u201d and \u201cParis Is Burning,\u201d both of which Mr. Daniels had considered remaking Ms. Demorest also said that he told her to watch \u201cSweet Charity\u201d and \u201cFemale Trouble\u201d during the audition process. As for making them a modern pop trio  \u2014   Ryan Destiny plays Alexandra, who has determined to make it in music without the help of her internationally famous   father (Lenny Kravitz) and Brittany O\u2019Grady plays Simone, Star\u2019s shy, damaged half sister  \u2014   Mr. Daniels said he liked that there wasn\u2019t a notable girl group at the moment, though he later learned of the existence of Fifth Harmony. (Ms. Demorest, coincidentally, was a writer on that group\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cWork From Home. \u201d) \u201cThey only last for a few years  \u2014   because they implode,\u201d Mr. Daniels said, with delight, of girl groups. \u201cThat\u2019s just the nature of the beast. \u201d (In fact, Fifth Harmony would lose a member to a solo career not long after \u201cStar\u201d had its premiere.) Careful attention to group chemistry led Mr. Daniels and Fox to audition Ms. Demorest, Ms. Destiny and Ms. O\u2019Grady about a dozen times, mostly as a unit, before choosing them for the roles. Despite Mr. Daniels\u2019s   approach at every opportunity  \u2014   he will direct the \u201cStar\u201d season finale in addition to its first two episodes  \u2014   learning to relinquish some authority has been a sometimes rocky process in his shift to TV. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a movie where you can control it from A to Z,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a director who has an interpretation of your interpretation, and you haven\u2019t personally written all of the episodes. \u201d He created \u201cStar\u201d with Tom Donaghy (\u201cThe Mentalist\u201d) not his \u201cEmpire\u201d   Danny Strong, who also wrote \u201cThe Butler. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Danny would understand this world,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cThis would not have been the right partnership for us, because of the specifics  \u2014   it\u2019s an underbelly. \u201d Early episodes touch on sexual abuse, human trafficking and an assault of a transgender woman outside a strip club. Gary Newman, the chairman and chief executive of Fox Television Group, credited Mr. Daniels\u2019s work for the authenticity of \u201cStar. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard, but we want to be a   network,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want all people to feel they\u2019re welcome. \u201d Mr. Daniels\u2019s broad demographic appeal is also \u201cgood business,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cPrior to \u2018Empire,\u2019 I think there was an underserved audience. \u201d At the same time, despite his role in diversifying TV, Mr. Daniels can be sent into a fit of frustration at a mention of last year\u2019s #OscarsSoWhite controversy over representation at the Academy Awards. (He was nominated for best director for \u201cPrecious\u201d in 2010.) \u201cGo out and do the work,\u201d he fumed over oatmeal at his apartment. \u201cOscars so white! So what? Do your work. Let your legacy speak and stop complaining, man. Are we really in this for the awards? \u201cIf I had thought that way  \u2014   that the world was against me  \u2014   I wouldn\u2019t be here now,\u201d he added. \u201cThese whiny people that think we\u2019re owed something are incomprehensible and reprehensible to me. I don\u2019t expect acknowledgment or acceptance from white America. I\u2019m going to be me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564458.8129716}
