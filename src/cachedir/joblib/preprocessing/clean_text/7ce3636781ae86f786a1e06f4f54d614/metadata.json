Maggie Hassan declared she\u2019s won New Hampshire\\'s U.S. Senate race, unseating Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte.During a hastily-called press conference outside the State House, Hassan said she\u2019s ahead now by enough votes to survive returns from the few outstanding towns that are left.\u201cI am proud to stand here as the next United States senator from New Hampshire,\u201d Hassan said to cheers from a large group of supporters led by Congresswoman Annie Kuster and Hassan\u2019s husband, Tom.The two-term governor said she hadn\u2019t spoken with Ayotte.It\u2019s clear we have maintained the lead in and have won this race,\u201d Hassan said.Sen. Ayotte issued a brief statement after Hassan\u2019s event but did not concede and deferred to Secretary of State Bill Gardner\u2019s final results.\"This has been a closely contested race from the beginning and we look forward to results being announced by the Secretary of State, and ensuring that every vote is counted in this race that has received an historic level of interest,\u201d Ayotte said.Hassan said she called to congratulate Gov.-Elect Chris Sununu, a Newfields Republican, and vowed to work together on a smooth transition of power in the state\u2019s corner office.With 99 percent of the vote counted, Hassan led Ayotte, a Nashua Republican, by 640 votes, or much less than 1 percent. There were only two voting precincts left to report.A recount of this statewide race seems like a real possibility; the margin is small enough that Ayotte will not have to pay for it. An earlier story follows: CONCORD \u2014 Republican incumbent Sen. Kelly Ayotte told supporters early Wednesday she is feeling \"really upbeat\" about her chances in one of the most closely watched \u2014 and expensive \u2014 U.S. Senate races in the country, but wasn\\'t ready to claim victory over Democratic challenger Gov. Maggie Hassan to earn a return to Washington representing the Granite State.At 12:36 a.m., Ayotte took to the podium at the Grappone Conference Center in Concord to address supporters at her victory party, in a dead heat with Hassan 48 percent to 48 percent, or 287,479 votes to 284,743 votes, with 83 percent of precincts in the state reporting.\"Joe and I are so excited to see all of you her tonight,\" said Ayotte. \"We feel really upbeat tonight.\"Ayotte went on to thank supporters and \"our next Gov. Sununu.\"\"We know how hard you have all worked. We are so grateful. We are humbled by the fact that you would believe in us. Right now we are very upbeat about where this race is, but I believe strongly in the fact that we want to have every vote in before we come out and talk to you. Every vote matters, because every person matters in this state.\"Gov. Hassan said while the race was too close to call, the campaign maintained a 5,000 vote lead, according to numbers compiled by her staff.\u201cWe still have a small but sustainable lead,\u201d she said.Hassan told the crowd that a number of smaller towns had yet to report numbers, but was confident the lead would hold. The campaign said its numbers show Hassan has a vote of 323,375 to Ayotte\u2019s 318,016 in over 90 percent of vote. The campaign said these numbers include results from big communities the Associated Press had yet to count like Salem, Derry, Lebanon, and Portsmouth. The cities of Manchester, Nashua, and Concord are included in the Hassan numbers.The governor headed home for the night and urged supporters to go home and get some sleep.Election Day 2016 marked the end of a long campaign cycle in the Granite State that kicked off nine months ago with the presidential primaries nine months ago, and didn\u2019t let up until the final ballots were cast around 8 p.m. Tuesday.The Ayotte/Hassan contest, the most expensive political race ever in New Hampshire with over $100 million spent, took center stage this cycle alongside the presidential race between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, cementing New Hampshire\u2019s status as a battleground state, with its four electoral votes up for grabs. The race is one of about a half dozen around the U.S. being closely watched on Tuesday, with the outcome likely playing a part in deciding if the Republicans retain control of the Senate, or if Democrats regain the majority they lost two years ago.\"It has been a great night for Republicans not just in New Hampshire but across the country,\" said NH GOP Chair Jennifer Horn. \"In New Hampshire, we know that when Republicans stand together, when Republicans fight together, we win.\" .'"}, "time": 1742628429.998841}
