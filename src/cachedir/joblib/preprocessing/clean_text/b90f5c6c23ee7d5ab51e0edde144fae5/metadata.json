Yes, 22 million people got insurance through the ACA. So, that\u2019s a plus. Our uninsurance rate now hovers around 10% and if all the states had expanded Medicaid, it would be even lower. On costs, yes costs have gone up, but they\u2019ve gone up much more slowly than they did under President Bush, and they\u2019ve moderated. For example, under President Bush, insurance premiums for employers went up 80% while under President Obama, they went up 35% a substantial reduction in the growth of healthcare costs. So, cost control has actually been significantly improved. And then in terms of quality, we\u2019ve seen hospital readmission rates within 30 days of discharge going down. We\u2019ve seen improvements in infections in hospitals, in no thromboemboli, no falls. So, whether it\u2019s access, cost, or coverage, the Affordable Care Act has been an improvement. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been a home run on every one of them, but a significant improvement. \u201d He added that \u201cin any big piece of legislation, for 300 million Americans, there are going to be some winners and losers. And mostly those losers were young, healthy people who were getting a great deal by the insurance companies, because they were young and healthy. \u201d He added that \u201cYoung healthy families of people who were in their 30s with two young kids, who don\u2019t use a lot of healthcare, got a great deal. But people who needed healthcare didn\u2019t get a great deal. Remember, if we\u2019re going to cover everyone, including people with illnesses, it\u2019s  \u2014   the cost is going to have to be spread out over people. Some people actually, unfortunately, did get price increases. The best solution to the price increases is to moderate healthcare cost growth, and the Affordable Care Act began us on a process to do that, and it is unfortunate that deductibles have gone up. I would note, the Republicans want to increase deductibles even more, and so, that\u2019s not a solution to the problem. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561822.9500844}
