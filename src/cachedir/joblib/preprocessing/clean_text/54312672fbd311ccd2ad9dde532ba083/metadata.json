Their motivation is crystal clear, according to CBS News York , which explains the sudden influx: \\n\u201cThe smugglers are telling [the masses of illegal] if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that there\u2019ll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date,\u201d [Border Patrol Agent Chris] Cabrera said. \u201cThey\u2019re also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, there\u2019s going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.\u201d \\nCabrera added that they\u2019ve encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along [the Texas city of] McAllen\u2019s stretch of the border some days. \\nIt\u2019s not just Donald Trump\u2019s imagination that Democrats are manipulating the immigration process to register as many Hillary Clinton voters as possible. Bloomberg notes independently that a number of American cities are opening allowing illegals to vote. In some cases, an ad hoc workaround is being impemented to give the process an air of respectability.'"}, "time": 1742564497.9982133}
