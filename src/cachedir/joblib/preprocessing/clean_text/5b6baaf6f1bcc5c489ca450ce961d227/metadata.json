Without it, the love songs that regularly place him in the Top 10  \u2014   megahits like \u201cAll of Me\u201d from 2013  \u2014   are anodyne enough to work as wedding songs they\u2019re a worthy and lucrative enterprise that can leave an unctuous, saccharine aftertaste. But \u201cDarkness and Light,\u201d his fifth studio album, treats love as something far more complex than a panacea and a fount of perpetual reassurance, with music to match. In his new songs, love can be a counterattack on mortality, a dangerous compulsion, a realm of sweaty adventures, a legacy from father to daughter, an escape from social media and a bulwark against forces of divisiveness. With a producer and   from outside the usual precincts of pop and    \u2014   the guitarist Blake Mills, who has worked with Alabama Shakes and Fiona Apple  \u2014   Mr. Legend\u2019s music turns less glossy: earthier and often spookier. Drum tones are often woody and hollow keyboards and strings open up hazy spaces, sometimes without a beat. Among the songwriters, along with   names like Julia Michaels and John Ryan, is Will Oldham, who\u2019s also known as the   Bonnie Prince Billy. \u201cLove Me Now,\u201d already a hit, is a    song with an overt sense of doom about the relationship: \u201cI know it\u2019ll kill me when it\u2019s over. \u201d Its track revolves around an insistent,   piano figure, and its chorus first arrives with Mr. Legend nearly alone, singing over simple, fading chords: pop with all of its misgivings built in. The album begins with a manifesto: \u201cI Know Better,\u201d a gospelly hymn that has Mr. Legend declaring, \u201cSome folks do what they\u2019re   baby, this time I won\u2019t\u201d and adding, \u201cMy history has brought me to this  \u2019s power in the color of my face. \u201d It\u2019s a connection to the socially conscious side Mr. Legend showed on \u201cWake Up! ,\u201d his 2010 album with the Roots, and in \u201cGlory,\u201d his   song for \u201cSelma\u201d with the rapper Common. So is the song that closes the album, \u201cMarching Into the Dark,\u201d which moves from   gospel roots into surreal modern production and ponders individual sacrifice and the course of history. But for the rest of the album, Mr. Legend quickly pivots back to love and pleasure with the rhetorically awkward yet undeniably catchy \u201cPenthouse Floor,\u201d which has a touch of Stevie Wonder in its dance beat. It starts out with allusions to Black Lives Matter and taking pride in upward mobility but ends up, after an appearance by Chance the Rapper, with the singer settling into hedonism, enjoying \u201cmy favorite mix, a little ignorance and   the penthouse, baby. \u201d Through most of the album, romance has as much to do with conflict and obsession as with comfort. \u201cRight by You (for Luna)\u201d is addressed to Mr. Legend\u2019s daughter it\u2019s a ballad, not a lullaby, posing unanswered questions and veering into dissonance. In \u201cWhat You Do to Me,\u201d anger seesaws with lust  \u2014   \u201cMake me love and hate you at the same time\u201d  \u2014   pitting a low synthesizer against a stomping beat. \u201cSame Old Story,\u201d with wavering, unstable keyboard chords and eerie sustained strings, is a tender accusation: \u201cPromising we\u2019ll stay   in your heart, you know better. \u201d In \u201cOverload,\u201d a   duet with Miguel that wanders between guitar chords and   jazz, there\u2019s a collision of love, fame and social media that leaves Mr. Legend wondering, \u201cMust we make a spectacle of love?\u201d Even when Mr. Legend plays his old, smoother self, making a pickup in a club in \u201cTemporarily Painless,\u201d there\u2019s a hint of doubt and defensiveness. The title track, \u201cDarkness and Light,\u201d is a duet with Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes, the perfect choice for a song that reclaims an old, slow soul back beat and revels in dynamics, with slinky verses that give way to an explosive chorus. His falsetto and her belting push themselves into the same space sometimes they trade verses, sometimes they split single lines. It makes desire a force of nature, ungovernable and irresistible and anything but simple.'"}, "time": 1742563252.1924555}
