Trump got into a feud with the Khan family, a Gold Star family who spoke about him. \\nTrump apparently didn\u2019t know what a Gold Star family is. This term is generally used to describe families who have lost a loved one in the military. \\nPaul Manafort, former advisor to George H.W. Bush\u2019s, Gerald Ford\u2019s, and Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaigns, became an advisor for the Donald Trump campaign during the general election season. His plan was for Trump to go low profile, so the media would then focus on his rival, Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. \\nManafort was mad when Trump went after the Khan family instead of focusing on the issues. He said: \u201cThe election is about the American people, it\u2019s not about you.\u201d \\nNow that we have less than two weeks until the election, Trump wants to rehash some of his craziest feuds. Trump said that if he were president Humayun Khan would still be alive. Khizr said : \u201cThis is the most cruel thing you can say to grieving parents, that if I was there this would not have happened. There\u2019s no sincerity in those remarks \u2026 This is one character that a leader must have to be the leader of a great country, to be the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the United States: empathy. And this person totally lacks that.\u201d \\nKhan is now joining Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. \\nCheck out the campaign ad he made for the Clinton campaign: \\nAnd watch Khan\u2019s entire speech from the convention : \\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .
