S. would suffer an \u201cunprecedented defeat\u201d at the hands of an \u201ciron dam\u201d like Iran. [Ali Akbar Velayati, head of the Expediency Council\u2019s Strategic Research Center, told the   Tasnim news agency that a \u201ccalculating newcomer\u201d like Trump wouldn\u2019t dare confront Iran, which is far more powerful than other countries the U. S. has come up against.  Velayati was responding to Trump\u2019s veiled warning on Friday to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in which he said Rouhani \u201cbetter be careful\u201d about threatening the U. S. \u201cWe are by no means worried about Trump\u2019s comments,\u201d Velayati said, adding that despite Trump\u2019s public rhetoric, the president is a calculating politician. Furthermore, the Iranian official told Tasnim, the opposition Trump faces at home among the media, judiciary and influential politicians will prevent him from doing what he wants with Iran. Velayati, who also served as Iran\u2019s foreign minister, said the Islamic Republic was not seeking war against any country, but would not waste a moment defending itself if necessary. His comments come after Rouhani addressed the Iranian people on Friday in an event to commemorate the 38th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. \u201cWe are experiencing conditions in which some novices have come to power in the region, in the world and in the U. S. as they should all know that they have to talk to the Iranian nation with the language of respect and dignity,\u201d Rouhani said. The following day, head of Iran\u2019s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations Kamal Kharrazi described the new president as \u201ca rookie person and a newcomer on the political scene [who] has made many mistakes. \u201d The commemoration of the revolution was marked with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets and celebrating by burning effigies of Trump and chanting \u201cDeath to America,\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562904.494641}
