S. election. [Great move on delay (by V. Putin)  \u2014   I always knew he was very smart!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016,   Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would not seek the expulsion of U. S. diplomats, but condemned the U. S. sanctions against Russia, calling them a \u201cprovocation aimed to further undermine   relations. \u201d President Obama\u2019s retaliation, including the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, comes just three weeks shy of   Donald Trump being sworn in as President. Media outlets like NBC News have reported that the \u201cCIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Donald Trump win, and NBC News has reported that intelligence officials believe \u2018with a high level of confidence\u2019 that Putin was personally involved,\u201d but neither the intelligence community nor the Obama administration has produced any substantive proof that clearly links the Russian government to the hacking. Given Obama\u2019s executive order of sanctions against Russia, the lack of public disclosure of any proven link between Russian intelligence or Vladimir Putin and the hacking is troubling, but adding to the lack of accountability is the fact that members of the House Intelligence committee have also been stonewalled by the Obama administration. As Breitbart News reported on Thursday, a source with knowledge on this matter told Breitbart that members of the committee were told they had to wait for an Obama   report to Congress to be issued first. Reuters reported that Senator Ron Johnson said, \u201cIt is disappointing that the CIA would provide information on this issue to the Washington Post and NBC but will not provide information to elected members of Congress\u201d after being denied a briefing by the CIA. Russia has repeatedly denied the hacking charges. At a press conference Thursday, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin called Obama\u2019s executive order \u201cunpredictable\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d and said they believed the Obama administration\u2019s action were meant \u201cto further harm   ties, which are at a low point as it is, as well as, obviously, to deal a blow to the foreign policy plans of the incoming administration of the  . \u201d   Trump said many times during the election that he favored a better relationship with Russia, including working with them to defeat ISIS.
