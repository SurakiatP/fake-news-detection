Because if Simone Biles  \u2014   the    American who is often called by sports pundits the best female gymnast ever, and whose performance in Rio de Janeiro will be among the most watched of these Olympics  \u2014   does what most everyone seems to expect and makes off with multiple gold medals, it is very likely that when she climbs the podium, the shininess of the discs around her neck will pale in comparison to the shininess of something else. Her leotard. In 2008, when Nastia Liukin won the gold medal in the individual   competition at the Olympics in Beijing, her leotard had 184 crystals on it. In 2012, when Gabby Douglas won the same event in London, her leotard had 1, 188. This year, many of the Team USA leotards will have close to 5, 000 Swarovski crystals each. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to imagine how we could get more crystals on,\u201d said Kelly McKeown, executive vice president for design and corporate relations at GK Elite, the official outfitter of the American national gymnastics team. This Olympics, \u201cwe may have hit peak crystal. \u201d Along with the difficulty of each routine, which caused the international gymnastics federation to change the assessment system in 2006 from one based on a scale of 1 to 10 to one with no ceiling, the amount of crystals on the American leotards has also been growing exponentially. This is not a coincidence. It has to do partly with one woman: Martha Karolyi, coordinator for the United States women\u2019s team since 2001, who, along with her husband, Bela, has been a formative influence on American gymnastics. But as with any grueling athletic contest that involves seemingly unimaginable physical feats accomplished by barely grown teenagers, it also has to do with competitive psychology, adolescent aesthetics, sacrifices made by elite athletes and technology. And it matters because women\u2019s gymnastics is one of the most widely viewed Olympic sports. (When the women\u2019s team won gold in London, the broadcast was the most watched of any Tuesday night network broadcast since 2002, which, not incidentally, was of the Salt Lake Olympics.) It is also one of the most commercially influential. There may not be a lot of young javelin throwers on neighborhood fields whispering about their favorite Olympians. But in local gyms all over the country and the world, girls who may never come anywhere close to an Olympic stadium can nevertheless dress like their bedazzled heroes. And they want to. Which is to say: in sparkles. More sparkles than Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve. How did we get here? Once upon a time, leotards were simple. Originally called maillots and popularized by the acrobat Jules L\u00e9otard (a pioneer of the flying trapeze) in the late 1800s, leotards as we know them literally took shape in the   century, albeit in a much baggier, utilitarian kind of way. Donna Strauss, a coach at Parkettes in Allentown, Pa. who has been working with national gymnasts since 1968, remembers early leotards as simply black    . In 1976, when Nadia Comaneci won a gold medal on the uneven bars with a perfect 10, she did so in a plain white leotard with three stripes down the side. \u201cWhen I started in the 1970s, my leo was polyester with a zipper down the front,\u201d said Michelle Dusserre Farrell, who at 15 became the youngest member of the 1984 United States gymnastics team. (Among gymnasts, leotards are generally \u201cleos. \u201d ) \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the early 1980s, when they were made with Lycra, that the leos finally stopped bagging. \u201d And it wasn\u2019t until 1984 and the explosion of Mary Lou Retton, who won a gold in the individual   (as well as four more medals) in a \u201cstars and stripes\u201d leotard, that bold graphics became a thing. At the time, Ms. Farrell said: \u201cIt got pretty mixed reviews. It wasn\u2019t subtle. \u201d When the Karolyis took over in 1988, things really began to change. \u201cWe went from being very patriotic to being much fancier,\u201d said Ms. McKeown of GK Elite. \u201cIn the early 1990s, the U. S. team always wore white, because Martha wanted to show off their \u201d Ms. McKeown said (referring to abs, not beer). Not long after, the coach began to lean toward purple and pink and red. Then came the sparkles. The bedazzling of the leotard began around the turn of the millennium, with a few crystals around the neckline or sprinkled over the garment. The crystals made the gymnast  \u2014   a small girl in a giant arena  \u2014   stand out in the field of play, highlighting her   movements. Combined with a fabric called Mystique, which overlays foil and hologram atop the spandex to create even more shine, the leotards gymnasts wore became ever glossier, especially as the crystals crept down the sleeves and over the body of the garment. \u201cIt\u2019s always Swarovski: They have the most shine and sparkle,\u201d Ms. McKeown said. \u201cMartha always wants \u2018more sparkle, more sparkle. \u2019\u201d Though television brings all the athletes up close, they can get lost amid the actual competition on the floor, and shine helps highlight and distinguish each girl. \u201cWhen the judges are there, every little thing counts,\u201d said Samantha Peszek, a member of the 2008 Olympic team who is working for NBC\u2019s digital and social content team for this summer\u2019s games. The crystals also serve to emphasize the aesthetic aspect of a sport that has become ever more focused on athleticism and tricks  \u2014   to its detriment, some argue. In a way, the fanciness and drama of the leotards can be seen as an attempt to correct a perceived imbalance between artistic power and physical power: telegraphing the idea that while \u201cour skill level says one thing, our dress style says another. \u201d The Olympic stadium \u201cis the biggest stage of our lives,\u201d Ms. Liukin, the 2008 Olympic gymnast and current NBC Olympic commentator, said. Note the emphasis on \u201cstage. \u201d It may seem reductive to compare Olympic gymnastics to, say, a Vegas arena, but the sartorial theory behind both is effectively the same: Use the bling to stand out. Though other national teams have also begun to bedazzle, none have reached the extent of the Americans, who have made it their signature. One of the odder things about interviewing an elite female gymnast is how quickly a conversation about the sacrifices and difficulties of her sport can suddenly become all about sparkle. It is a word that comes up again and again. \u201cObviously, sparkles are not an element in the scoring,\u201d Ms. Peszek said. \u201cBut it\u2019s part of the \u2018look good, feel good, do good\u2019 aspect. It\u2019s a very important part of the sport. It may sound trivial, but what you wear really matters. For some girls, it\u2019s why they got into the sport. \u201d As the athletes and their coaches point out, elite gymnasts who start training seriously at a very young age often don\u2019t get to go to prom or other typical adolescent parties because they are always in the gym it has become a clich\u00e9 of the sport to refer to the Olympic competition leotard as the gymnast\u2019s \u201cprom dress. \u201d Gymnasts cannot wear jewelry during competition save for a pair of stud earrings, so the crystals also act as a   for other more traditional adornment. \u201cWe\u2019re   athletes, but we all love fashion, too,\u201d Ms. Liukin said. Aly Raisman, the captain of the United States team in Rio and London, is famous among her peers for her interest in style, especially evening wear. Each Olympian now receives a package with eight competition leotards and 12 training leotards. Each is   to her body, and on the open retail market, the heavily   competition leotards would cost an average of $1, 200 (more than many prom dresses). Though Ms. Karolyi has the final word on the team competition, the gymnasts have input and are free to choose their own leotard for the individual events. During the 2012 London Games, for example, the team voted together to wear the red Mystique style with a stylized crystal pattern across the body during the team competition. \u201cIt was like a ball gown,\u201d Ms. Liukin said. Though it may seem as if so many stones could inhibit performance, Ms. McKeown said that the additional weight is incidental. GK also makes \u201ccouture\u201d leotards that have 15, 000 crystals each, she said: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t compete in those. \u201d The company has a fleet of     machines that cost over $50, 000 each and use lasers and robotic technology to apply the stones to the fabric. Meanwhile, Swarovski has been working to change the makeup and cut of its crystals so that they will be ever lighter to accommodate demand. According to Alexander Wellhoefer, senior vice president for North America of Swarovski Professional, they have adapted machinery from the   industry to develop new techniques for stone application in ever more complex and precise patterns. This autumn, Mr. Wellhoefer said, Swarovski will introduce a new crystal product, called a Concise Crystal, that is 50 percent lighter than previous stones, allowing for even more encrustation and refractory gleam. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crystal arms race,\u201d Mr. Wellhoefer said. The question now is whether we have reached the crystal saturation point when it comes to competition, or whether there is even further to go. \u201cI ask myself that every tournament,\u201d Ms. McKeown said. \u201cWe were doing a fitting with the girls the other day, and we all said, \u2018Can you imagine what the leos are going to look like in four years if we keep going in this direction? \u2019\u201d It may seem, given Ms. Karolyi\u2019s coming retirement, that we are at a natural turning point in the sparkle situation. But if Ms. Biles and her teammates, all known crystalphiles, perform as expected while in full sparkle mode, chances are good that the millions of young fans who are watching will internalize the connection without ever entirely realizing why. After all, when asked if there was ever a gymnast who tended, say, more to the minimalist Helmut Lang school of leotards than to the fairy princess Marchesa look, Jordyn Wieber, a member of the gold medal 2012 team who is now a student at U. C. L. A. and manager of the gymnastics team (which is known for the \u201ccreative backs\u201d of their leotards) hemmed and hawed and thought for a while. \u201cWell, I guess some girls like more sparkle than others,\u201d she offered, her voice trailing off. But, she added more decisively, \u201cI have never met a gymnast who doesn\u2019t love rhinestones. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628444.6106884}
