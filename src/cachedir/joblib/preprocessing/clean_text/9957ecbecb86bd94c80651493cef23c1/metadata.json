[ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill made an interesting point in a recent tweet saying that the NFL can excuse a lot of bad behavior by players, but Kaepernick\u2019s perceived   is one that can\u2019t be ignored.  No, he won\u2019t. In the NFL you can   an abuser, a drunk driver and a multitude of sins. But an \u201d ?\u201d Nope. https:  .   \u2014   Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 22, 2017,  That is a solid point, for sure. The league has allowed wife abusers, drug users, past gang members, and tax cheats continue playing, but Colin Kaepernick\u2019s transgression was against the whole country and seems far more than a mere personal failing, especially for a sport that wants to be considered as America\u2019s game. Hill added another thought to the discussion after President Donald Trump took some measure of credit for Kaepernick\u2019s troubles. Think we\u2019ve seen the last of Kaep as an NFL player. There was a limited market before but after Trump\u2019s comments, it\u2019s a wrap. https:  .   \u2014   Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 22, 2017,  The ESPNer is referring to Trump\u2019s March 20 rally in Louisville, Kentucky, where the president slammed Kaepernick, broaching the subject by assuring the audience that no one wants a \u201cnasty tweet from Donald Trump. \u201d As the crowd roared, the president continued, saying, \u201cI said, if I remember that one, I\u2019m going to the people of Kentucky because they like when people actually stand for the American flag. \u201d This is far from the first time Trump has criticized Kaepernick. Last August he told The Hill newspaper that maybe Kaepernick \u201cshould find a country that works better for him. \u201d The news that the 49ers   quarterback can\u2019t find a new birth in the NFL is on the tongue of nearly every sports commentator, as Sporting News noted. To mention a few, Los Angeles Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke says Kaepernick is \u201cclearly\u201d being blackballed for his   protests, Mike Golic of ESPN2\u2019s \u201cMike  Mike in the Morning\u201d also noted that team executives and owners are wary about bringing Kaepernick\u2019s sort of trouble to their teams, and Mike Freeman of Bleacher Report exclaimed that Kaepernick is being punished \u201cfor the crime of speaking his mind. \u201d Sports reporters aren\u2019t the only ones claiming Kaepernick is being mistreated. A growing list of liberals are now insisting that the NFL\u2019s pass on hiring the player is evidence of \u201cracism. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742562763.025194}
