[\u201cToday\u2019s generation has been trained to think differently from my generation. We would stand for the flag in a heartbeat \u2014  because we realized the opportunities we had,\u201d said Burgess Owens on Thursday.  Owens was an   safety at the University of Miami, who was drafted by the New York Jets in 1973 and played for the Jets until joining the Raiders for their run at Super Bowl XV. Owens was at CPAC to discuss with people his new book \u201cLiberalism or How to Turn Good Men into Whiners, Weenies and Wimps\u201d and attend a book signing. \u201cToday\u2019s generation came from BET group \u2014  the BET has been talking down our country for the longest time. \u201d Black Entertainment Television is the top cable channel focused on the   community. Today\u2019s young   have been twisted up by BET, he said. \u201cThey tend to be more racist. They tend to be more \u201d he said. \u201cI was the third black American to be recruited by the University of Miami and I remember going down there \u2014  my goal was not to fail,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was really what allowed our community to think,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to leave our families down. We didn\u2019t want to let our race down. We would work as hard as we could, so we would not fail. \u201d Owens said that when he was coming of age in the late 1960s, there was always a racial consciousness that was trying to break through and disrupt the traditional ways of life. In those times in his hometown of Tallahassee, Florida, the black community was stronger than most other communities, black or white, he said. \u201cThe community as that time was totally committed to the family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the highest percentage of men committed to marriage. We had the fastest growing   in the country. \u201d Conservatism, with its emphasis on work, entrepreneurship, and faith traditions, is a natural fit for   but somehow the narrative got switched up. Owens said he wrote his book because   politics and policies have destroyed thriving black communities, but no one else seemed to want to talk about it. \u201cBack in 1910, the NAACP, started by 21 white Marxist, socialist, atheist Democrats, began to intertwine the thought of liberalism into my community,\u201d he said. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is the most prominent of the civil rights organizations. \u201cWe started to pull away from the pillars that always made our country great and towards being and feeling like victims,\u201d he said. \u201cThey taught our race that the real value was in being with the white race, instead of what we were doing at the time,\u201d the father of six said. \u201cI would say to a young   man: Recognize who you are, let\u2019s  . Take the rolls you are supposed to take. Take care of your family. Respect women \u2014  big time \u2014  and we will be a great country again,\u201d he said. His message to white Americans: \u201cDon\u2019t apologize anymore for who they are. We have a great society with great ancestors, who did their best. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562293.7393696}
