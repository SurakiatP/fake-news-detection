At her arraignment in Criminal Court in Manhattan, the woman, Melanie   30, pleaded not guilty to a   murder charge. The police said Ms.   pushed Connie Watton, 49, of Queens, in front of a southbound No. 1 train at the busy Times   Street station around 1:20 p. m. on Monday. Prosecutors said in a statement read by Justice Gerald Lebovits of State Supreme Court that two witnesses saw Ms.   push Ms. Watton. \u201cThis is a strong case with multiple eyewitnesses, and the defendant has admitted to the crime,\u201d Matthew Thiman, an assistant district attorney, said in court. Ms.   standing next to her lawyer, seemed surprised. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cI did not admit to nothing. \u201d Her lawyer, Mathew Mari, said his client maintained her innocence. \u201cShe was adamant that she did not confess,\u201d he said, \u201cand she is not guilty. \u201d The police described Ms.   as emotionally disturbed, but Mr. Mari said he was unaware of her medical history and had not spoken to any of her relatives. \u201cShe told me that she had some kind of medical history, but she wouldn\u2019t go into it,\u201d Mr. Mari said. He said that he spent about 15 minutes with Ms.   before her appearance on Tuesday, and that she had been calm but not very talkative. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have very much to say other than, quote, she is not guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t want to discuss anything else. \u201d Ms.   has no criminal convictions and has lived at the same address in Queens for three years, he said. She worked as a home aide until about two or three weeks ago, he said, but did not say why she was no longer employed. Justice Lebovits, filling in at the lower court on Election Day, granted the district attorney\u2019s request that Ms.   be held without bail. He set her next appearance for Thursday. No relatives of Ms. Watton or Ms.   were in court. At Ms. Watton\u2019s apartment building in Astoria, Queens, a friend of the family said her husband, Robert, did not want to talk.'"}, "time": 1742563477.9067273}
