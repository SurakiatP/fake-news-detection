T. \u201d  \u2014   but it ended up as a colossal misfire. The movie, an   fantasy that drew appreciative reviews, took in about $19. 6 million Friday through Sunday, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Faring better was \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan. \u201d Starring Alexander Skarsgard as the   and made by Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow, \u201cTarzan\u201d collected roughly $38. 1 million over the   period. That total was much higher than analysts predicted before release. Most critics turned up their noses, but audiences gave the film an   in CinemaScore exit polls, suggesting positive word of mouth. Even so, \u201cTarzan\u201d remains squarely in the loser column when it comes to profitability. Loaded with visual effects  \u2014   violent apes, stampeding wildebeests  \u2014   the movie cost a   $180 million to make, not counting marketing. \u201cThis property has always really been about the international opportunity,\u201d Jeff Goldstein, Warner\u2019s executive vice president of domestic distribution, said by phone on Sunday. \u201cYou can best assess it a month from now. \u201d Directed by David Yates and   Margot Robbie, \u201cTarzan\u201d opened in limited overseas release over the weekend, taking in $18. 8 million. Important markets like Britain and China are still to come. While acknowledging a \u201cfrustrating\u201d result for \u201cThe BFG\u201d at home, David Hollis, Disney\u2019s distribution chief, also pointed to international audiences as a potential salvation for the movie, which is based on a book by Roald Dahl. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the film,\u201d Mr. Hollis said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be reliant in a lot of ways on international. \u201d So far, \u201cThe BFG\u201d has opened in only two overseas markets, Russia and Australia. With \u201cThe BFG\u201d collapsing in North America and \u201cTarzan\u201d not exactly sizzling, the No. 1 movie on Hollywood\u2019s home turf over the July Fourth weekend was again \u201cFinding Dory. \u201d That sequel, from Disney\u2019s Pixar division, took in an estimated $41. 9 million for a   domestic total of $372. 3 million. \u201cTarzan\u201d was second. Third place went to \u201cThe Purge: Election Year\u201d (Universal) a horror sequel that cost only $10 million to make and roughly $20 million to market. It sold a strong $30. 9 million in tickets. Blumhouse Productions, the   company behind the \u201cPurge\u201d series, has successfully kept this franchise going by pursuing different storytelling styles. The previous installment had action underpinnings this one added a political dimension. The summer box office always has ups and downs, but the current season has been much bumpier than usual. Disney has found two monster hits (\u201cFinding Dory\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d) but has also suffered two major flops (\u201cThe BFG\u201d and \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass\u201d). Other   movies that have received a disappointing response from domestic audiences include \u201cIndependence Day: Resurgence,\u201d \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows\u201d and \u201cWarcraft. \u201d An   on sequels has been one reason for Hollywood\u2019s rough ride. But analysts have cautioned about overgeneralizing at the season\u2019s midway point. Several movies ahead could still salvage the summer box office, including \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets,\u201d \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628362.8466766}
