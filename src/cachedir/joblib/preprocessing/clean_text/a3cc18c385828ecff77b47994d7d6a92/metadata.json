A poor, uneducated laborer from the eastern countryside of Cuba, he had arrived in the capital a few years earlier and, like most of his neighbors, could hardly believe what was happening. \u201cIt was an emotional shock,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cThese bearded men, poorly dressed  \u2014   they won! And on behalf of the lower classes!\u201d Mr. Montes, who was 25 at the time, stayed loyal to Mr. Castro, who died on Friday, from that moment. The Castro revolution gave him an education, a home, and a job as a police officer who sometimes guarded the comandante himself. But that allegiance slipped from generation to generation in Mr. Montes\u2019s family, and in Cuba as a whole. His son\u2019s views darkened decades ago, during tussles with the Castro government\u2019s restrictions. His teenage granddaughter, Rocio, has spent most of her youth feeling glum about the conditions in her country. \u201cThere are too many Cubans who get up every day and struggle and struggle, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cMy dream is to leave. \u201d The Montes family\u2019s story of faith and disillusion is common. Cuban families have been arguing about Mr. Castro since he came to power. His death has again produced an intense clash of emotions for many Cubans who recognize that he was more than just a political figure. He was also a brother, a father and a grandfather to various Cuban generations  \u2014   a familiar presence whose ideals, whims and ego shaped everyone\u2019s identity and daily life. Whether they wanted him around or not, Fidel was there, with his   speeches, his billboards and the grandiose absolutes  \u2014   \u201cSocialismo o muerte!\u201d (\u201cSocialism or death! \u201d)  \u2014   that helped produce early triumphs in education and health care, along with restrictions on speech and assembly and, later on, persistent economic failures. His relationship to the country was remarkably personal. Robert A. Pastor, a former Latin America adviser to President Jimmy Carter, used to say that Mr. Castro was one of the few world leaders referred to by just their first names. Many Cubans have grown comfortable with calling him a complicated relative. \u201cYou have to look at this in a very cool way  \u2014   this is like the father who has been there all the time that has taken the family through thick and thin,\u201d Carlos Alzugaray Treto, a former Cuban diplomat, said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cMaybe at times you don\u2019t agree with him, but most of the time you agree with what he has done. \u201d Yet Mr. Castro was not exactly a common loved one. He was also the maximum leader  \u2014   charismatic but quick to anger, a guerrilla whose name Cubans were often afraid to utter. Because he ruled for decades, Mr. Castro\u2019s impact  \u2014   and the perception of it  \u2014   changed over time. Cubans born before the revolution saw him as a transformative force for good or ill. Those born later, especially after the Soviet Union started collapsing in 1989, tend to view him as an obdurate barrier to economic opportunity and to integration with the rest of the world. In life, he was often an enigma in death, for Cuban families like the Monteses, he is a collage of competing images, from the inspiring young rebel to the    old man. Mr. Montes first heard of the barbudos, or bearded rebels, when he was picking coffee and fruit in the fields in Cuba\u2019s eastern province of Guant\u00e1namo. It was the early 1950s, and poor farmers in the area had started banding together, revolting against wealthy landowners. Mr. Castro was among many leaders said to be demanding better working conditions. On July 26, 1953, Mr. Castro staged his first major attack, raiding the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, now the country\u2019s   city. Mr. Castro was caught, and he defended himself in court three months later with a lengthy speech that included the line \u201cHistory will absolve me. \u201d Mr. Montes had decided by then to move to Havana  \u2014   and to root for Mr. Castro and his guerrillas. \u201cThere was a lot of injustice back then,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cCoups, crime. The government didn\u2019t care at all for the people. \u201d Compared with its neighbors, Cuba was well off, with a   income in 1958 that was exceeded in Latin America by only Argentina and Venezuela, according to United Nations statistics. But the Cuban economy was essentially stuck in place, with yawning inequality. In rural areas like those where Mr. Montes grew up, more than 90 percent of the homes lacked electricity. In Havana, the streets were clogged with a mix of   Cadillacs and ragtag beggars. After taking power in 1959, Mr. Castro promised radical change. \u201cWe have fought to give democracy and liberty to our people,\u201d he said days after his triumphant arrival in Havana. He delivered, Mr. Montes said. Over the next few months, the Castro government announced plans for land reform to grant property to the poor, taxes of 80 percent on expensive cars and additional government spending to decrease unemployment. In December that year, Mr. Montes was hired as a police officer. It was his first steady job since his arrival in Havana and came with free schooling, leading him from a   education to a high school diploma. The pride he felt at his rise into the middle class can be seen in family pictures from that era, with his wife wearing new necklaces beside her smiling husband. Even in his 80s, he speaks of his first few years on the police force with the excitement of a new cadet. \u201cWhen someone committed a crime, we arrested them, but always with a sense of justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t abuse anyone. It was a process for everyone. It wasn\u2019t just for the upper classes. \u201d From the outside, especially in Washington, Mr. Castro seemed to be upending Cuba\u2019s justice system, summarily executing opponents and filling Cuban jails. Mr. Montes, however, said he had seen a police force once viewed as a collection of corrupt thugs becoming professional. From 1959 to 1962, Mr. Montes said, Cubans all over the country were eager to serve Mr. Castro. But there were enemies close by  \u2014   mostly wealthier Cuban exiles who had fled when Mr. Castro began nationalizing property. They had the support of the United States, and when their attack came at the Bay of Pigs on April 17, 1961, Mr. Montes was guarding the home of Celia S\u00e1nchez, a famous guerrilla fighter and Mr. Castro\u2019s longtime lover and confidante. Around 4 a. m. Mr. Montes said, there was a flurry of activity inside. Moments later Mr. Castro emerged, surrounded by armed escorts. \u201cHe looked calm,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cNo one knew what was happening. No one knew they attacked us. \u201d The Cuban missile crisis and the American trade embargo only strengthened the siege mentality that Mr. Castro relied on for decades, as he argued repeatedly that Cuba must remain under tight control lest the northern imperialists invade and turn the island into an American fief. In an interview in late 2012, Mr. Montes said he had never questioned that assessment, even when he was with critics of Mr. Castro\u2019s authoritarian ways. In 1970, during the government\u2019s effort to harvest a record 10 million tons of sugar, Mr. Montes helped guard 300 political prisoners forced to cut sugar cane. Mr. Montes said they had not seemed to be bad people. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, with what sounded like a touch of disappointment, \u201cthey were wrong. \u201d He said he had often felt the same way about relatives who at times were critical of Mr. Castro, including some who had moved to the United States. \u201cThe revolution is a process,\u201d he said. Shifting in his seat, on a flowered couch at his home in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, he looked toward his son\u2019s house next door. \u201cThey don\u2019t see things very clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that they have the greatest opportunity in the world they have the opportunity to study. \u201d He said he wished younger Cubans in his family could see the broader context. \u201cWe were a poor, uneducated, humble family before the revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there was a change. It\u2019s a radical change that\u2019s still maturing. \u201d The entrance to Juan Carlos\u2019s home is covered in green vines with bunches of bitter grapes. More than a decade ago, he ran a private restaurant, or paladar, beneath the greenery. He also used to rent rooms to tourists until he developed a new business in which he uses his newly acquired Spanish passport to travel to Panama to buy clothes and other items to sell in Havana. He is a member of what might be called the \u201cresolver\u201d generation  \u2014   those who learned to resolve or negotiate their way around the shortages, regulations and inefficiencies of Cuban socialism in its later stages. If his father\u2019s image of Mr. Castro and the revolution was shaped by the changes of the 1950s or \u201960s, his views have been sculpted by the transition from the flush 1980s to the scavenging \u201990s. The shift was significant. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Cuba lost a patron that had provided around $4 billion a year in credits and subsidies. The economy contracted by 34 percent from 1990 to 1993, with chronic shortages of fuel, soap, food  \u2014   just about everything. Cuban officials acknowledged in 1990 that the country had entered a \u201cspecial period. \u201d The implication was that Cuba would need to make some exceptions to the norm. In 1993, Mr. Castro legalized the American dollar and allowed Cubans to become   in dozens of industries, especially those serving tourists. Scholars still debate the degree to which Cuba adopted capitalism in that period, but Juan Carlos was one of many who took advantage. He was 31 at the time and had already become frustrated with the way the Castro government worked. In his 20s, he worked at Cuba\u2019s customs agency, as his father had after his tenure on the police force. What Juan Carlos saw, he said, was an antidemocratic system that rewarded silence instead of initiative. He said his frustration peaked in the late 1980s when he was rebuffed by Communist Party officials for gathering recommendations from colleagues for improving the agency. He believed he was doing what socialism revered: organizing workers. \u201cBut the party guys,\u201d he said, \u201cthey just told me: \u2018That\u2019s not right. Here are the things we are going to talk about, and you, don\u2019t stand up and talk. \u2019\u201d Juan Carlos shook his head and laughed as if expressing a sentiment that Cubans have long relied on to describe   with the government: \u201cNo es f\u00e1cil\u201d  \u2014   it\u2019s not easy. He left his job just before the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. Over the next few years, he found work in hotels. When Mr. Castro legalized small restaurants, Juan Carlos decided to open one with his wife, but there was a problem: He needed permission from the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, the neighborhood party watchdog, and the group had not met in years. So he nominated himself to lead the group and got his neighbors to support his candidacy. \u201cI became the president so I could open the restaurant,\u201d he said. The Castro government was never far away, however. The 1990s led to relative economic openness, but in fits and starts as Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal, who took over presidential powers in 2006, limited change. Businesses must stay small under laws that restrict how many employees can be hired. Supplies must be bought from the government, and crackdowns are common. Even as relations with the United States have improved, peaking with reopened embassies and President Obama\u2019s visit this year, the economic life of the island remains constricted by Cuba\u2019s loyalty to central control. \u201cIt\u2019s like an accordion  \u2014   they open a little, they close,\u201d Juan Carlos said. \u201cBut they never open it up all the way. \u201d Success, then, has tended to play favorites. Economic and racial inequality, after improving in the early years of the revolution, has gotten worse since the 1990s. Cubans with small businesses and more lucrative jobs in tourism are typically   with advantages built up over time. Some have relatives in Miami. Others have connections in government or, in the case of Juan Carlos, Spanish ancestry and a home in Vedado with extra space. He acknowledged that he had done relatively well through much hard work. During one winter visit, he popped a tape into a VCR, showing his daughter\u2019s quincea\u00f1era  \u2014   her 15th birthday party  \u2014   at the Hotel Nacional. The girl, Rocio, wore a light   gown and thanked her parents as the guests drank and danced. It looked like a small prom. But for Juan Carlos, and especially for his daughter, one night of fun is nowhere near enough to create contentment. Rocio dreams of becoming an art historian. Tall and thin, she described Cuba with the nuanced sophistication that comes from a good education and plenty of time to think things through. In her eyes, Cuba is purgatory, and even before he died, Mr. Castro was a specter of the past, studied in textbooks more than seen. \u201cFidel had an enormous vision,\u201d she said. And, yes, there a lot of things she said she loved about Mr. Castro\u2019s Cuba: the breezy liberty of the streets,   and rarely snagged with traffic the emphasis on education and culture. She said she sometimes feared that violence would return once Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro were gone. But mostly, as she has grown from adolescence to adulthood, she has wanted to leave. Her older sister already lives in Spain. Her best friend went to Miami for a vacation one summer and stayed, telling Rocio about the crowded shopping malls and the impressive facilities at her new school. Most of Rocio\u2019s friends, she said, hope to get out of Cuba as soon as they can. \u201cMy generation, we\u2019re not worried about politics or ideals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to get out. Abroad you can achieve so much more. You can be recognized for your work, internationally, by the world. \u201d Fidel Castro\u2019s era of speeches, ideology and Cold War standoffs is not what today\u2019s ambitious young people want. Like many young Cubans, Rocio mostly wants Cuba to catch up. Why is there no open and affordable access to the internet? Why can\u2019t she easily get on Facebook to say hi to her sister in Barcelona? Why is it so hard to visit the Louvre, in person or virtually? \u201cI think everyone has a right to get the information they want to think and study,\u201d she said. She said that the American trade embargo clearly did not help, but that most young people considered their own government responsible for creating a society of limits. \u201cFidel and Ra\u00fal started out with a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t achieve what they said they would achieve. \u201d She wants the same thing her grandfather and Fidel Castro wanted when they were young: radical change and a fair shot at making a life for herself on her terms. The changes of the past few years under Ra\u00fal Castro, allowing more private enterprise and travel, offer some hope, she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not changing at the pace it needs to. \u201d Fidel Castro is gone  \u2014   \u201cHe was a man of the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Montes said in an interview on Saturday night  \u2014   and his granddaughter has long been ready to move on. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to wait,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742562238.160682}
