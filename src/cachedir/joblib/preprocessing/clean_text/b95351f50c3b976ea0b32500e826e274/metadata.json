In an interview with the Guardian, Parker said, 'It is using its whole range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways - involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks'. According to him, Russia is currently working across the whole Europe and the UK, and the MI5 is to oppose it. There re a lot of Russian intelligence officers in the territory of Great Britain, but what is different from the cold war is that there is cyberwarfare today. Russia tries to get military secrets, information about industrial projects, economy, government and foreign policy, Director-General of the Security Service stated. As Pravda.Ru reported, before that the US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed that Russia was responsible for cyber attacks on the US. The US special services went all out to spy on Moscow. It is planned that underground CIA agents will be involved as well as abilities of the NSA within cyber espionage, satellite systems and other means. Russia in its turn allocates minimum funds for espionage. Pravda.Ru\""}, "time": 1742564597.4404778}
