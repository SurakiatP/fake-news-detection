Each time the girl came near the flames and kitchen knives, Ms. Infante used her body to gently push her away. Geraliz, who is 4 and has autism, eventually distracted herself watching children\u2019s shows on a   iPad. For the moment, the possibility that she might get hurt had passed. \u201cSo much nervousness,\u201d Ms. Infante, 27, said in Spanish. \u201cI wish for a bigger apartment with all of my soul. A separate kitchen, this is all I need. \u201d She added, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of breaks and spills. \u201d Almost every surface in the small   apartment doubles as a space for something else: pots and pans on top of magazines, children\u2019s toys atop cleaning supplies and food wrappers. With no formal kitchen area, a gas stove, a refrigerator and cabinets line the      living room\u2019s back wall. Ms. Infante, who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, is raising Geraliz and her    son, Joshua, by herself. Geraliz communicates in screeches and tugs at her mother. Joshua was born with a deformed heart, but will not be healthy enough for   surgery until he turns 1 in April. Ms. Infante said the children\u2019s father, her former boyfriend, had moved out because he did not feel that he could cope with the challenges involved in raising Geraliz. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t handle it emotionally,\u201d she said as she sat in one of the apartment\u2019s only chairs, a tiny seat for her children. \u201cIt was too much for him to accept. \u201d During the day, Ms. Infante works as a cashier at a Key Food grocery store, earning $800 a month and struggling because of her limited ability to speak English to earn a promotion. She said she did not want to depend on public assistance but had to, collecting about $1, 050 a month combined in food stamps and disability benefits. At night, almost everything is a chore. While she prepares dinner or cleans the apartment, she tries to distract Geraliz with the iPad while hoping that Joshua does not start to cry. Doing the laundry meant lugging the dirty clothes to a laundromat two blocks away with the children in tow. To save money on drying, she would carry the wet clothes back to her     and hang them on a line in the hallway leading into the apartment. That cumbersome task was recently made easier. Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund, gave her $350 toward a $800 washing machine and helped to have it installed in her apartment. Ms. Infante still   the clothes. It has also become less stressful to make sure that her children are safe while she is at work. Catholic Charities guided Ms. Infante to enroll Geraliz at the Kennedy Child Study Center, an affiliate agency that provides free services for children with developmental challenges. Ms. Infante said her daughter was getting better at communicating and, with the help of workers at the center, had learned how to grab ahold of her when she needed attention. The center also helped Ms. Infante enroll in English classes at the City College of New York, which start in February. She said she wanted to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in childhood education and get a job as a teacher within five years. For those plans to work out, she will need to find a babysitter for Joshua by the time classes begin. The center is also helping her make those arrangements. Ms. Infante said that her former boyfriend was still around. He lives in a separate apartment in Upper Manhattan, works at another grocery store and pays the rent on Ms. Infante\u2019s place. He visits the children \u201conce or twice a week\u201d at their apartment, she said, but she is not ready to welcome him back full time. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone or anything,\u201d she said, rising quickly to stir the rice and check on the chicken. \u201cI\u2019m fine. What I need is a separate kitchen so I can cook without worrying about the kids. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562499.7351296}
