Paul revealed he has been in constant contact with President Donald Trump about the issue, including a phone call Thursday night, and said the president is \u201cvery open to negotiation. \u201d[Kassam asked if House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) was correct to argue that repealing Obamacare without an immediate comprehensive replacement plan is impossible, and the plan his caucus has put on the table is the closest to repeal they can get.  \u201cI\u2019ve always been for repeal and replace at the same time, but not necessarily in the same bill,\u201d Senator Paul replied. \u201cThe reason why I think you need \u2018replace\u2019 is we need to offer hope, and we need to offer an insurance product that is inexpensive, and something that will fix the marketplace so everybody can get access to health insurance. \u201d \u201cThe problem with putting replace and repeal in one bill is that we all tend to agree on the repeal aspect, Republicans, but we tend to disagree on the replacement aspect,\u201d he said. \u201cMy idea of replacement is trying to let the marketplace work, encouraging people to join   and healthcare associations so they can drive prices down, and   the sale of all kinds of insurance. \u201d \u201cSome of those things we actually agree with Paul Ryan on. The problem is Paul Ryan has a lot of Obamacare Lite stuff that he wants to keep in there,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe wants to keep the Obamacare subsidies. He calls them tax credits, refundable tax credits. He wants to keep the Obamacare taxes, all of the taxes, for a year  \u2014   and then he wants to keep the Cadillac tax, the tax on good insurance, forever. \u201d \u201cHe also has an individual mandate in there, which is curious, because if you\u2019ve listened to the debate for the last six, seven years, one of the things Republicans have hated the worst is the individual mandate,\u201d Paul added. \u201cHe keeps the individual mandate. You just don\u2019t pay the government you have to pay the insurance company. I think if you talk to customers and patients across the country and talk to doctors, there\u2019s not a great deal of difference in dislike between the government and the insurance companies. You\u2019re not going to make a lot of us happy if we have to pay the insurance company a penalty instead of the government. \u201d  \u201cBut there\u2019s also insurance company bailouts in there. This gets to the fundamental heart of the problem. The problem with Obamacare is they tell people, \u2018You know what? You can wait to buy insurance until after you\u2019re sick.\u2019 When they do that, nobody buys insurance until they\u2019re sick, and the price of the insurance goes up. Ryancare doesn\u2019t fix that. If you do not fix that, the premiums will continue to skyrocket, but we\u2019re going to be blamed for it,\u201d the senator warned his fellow Republicans.  \u201cAfter repeal is voted on, and even if it\u2019s an incomplete repeal or Obamacare Lite, Republicans will own this. So we\u2019ve got to get it right before we do this. We have to understand fundamentally that if you wait to let people buy insurance until after they\u2019re sick, they will,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interesting thing about the individual mandate in the Ryan plan is that let\u2019s say you do lose your job, or let\u2019s say you can\u2019t buy insurance for a while. Now you know that when you buy it again, you have a 30 percent penalty. You don\u2019t get the penalty until you buy it. So why would you buy it? You\u2019re going to wait to buy it until you get sick. So once again, as the adverse selection gets worse, the death spiral of Obamacare continues after Ryancare,\u201d Paul argued. Kassam noted that the White House is making a push for the House bill on Paul\u2019s home turf in Kentucky and asked if the situation had devolved into \u201c  war\u201d between Senator Paul and the executive branch. \u201cActually, I think the president is very open to negotiation,\u201d Paul replied. \u201cI talked to him again last night by phone. I\u2019ve talked to him twice a week, which is quite a bit for anybody to talk to the president that\u2019s not in the administration. \u201d \u201cI talked to him again last night. He said he\u2019s open to negotiation, but I reiterated to him that Paul Ryan went on TV for 45 minutes yesterday with a press conference, and he said, \u2018The response to this, the choices are binary.\u2019 Well, binary means there are two choices: either we take it or leave it. Either we take Obamacare Lite or we get nothing. That isn\u2019t sitting well with conservatives, and I promise you, the more we hear Paul Ryan say, \u2018Take it or leave it,\u2019 the less we\u2019re willing to take it,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, we are concerned that if we vote for Obamacare Lite, and insurance premiums still continue to go through the roof, and a year from now, insurance companies are going bankrupt the same way they\u2019re going bankrupt now, people will say, \u2018What did you guys do? You had six years to figure this out, and you couldn\u2019t get it right,\u2019\u201d Paul said. When Kassam asked if opponents of the Ryan bill had the votes to keep it from passing, Paul replied, \u201cThe proof\u2019s in the pudding. \u201d \u201cThere are 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus. They will make their decision. So far, their leadership and their voting has been that they\u2019re for clean repeal. I believe they voted 80 percent to take a position of clean repeal. And that\u2019s my position: separate repeal from replace,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou do replace. I do replace it on the same day. We\u2019re not completely unable to vote on more than one thing in a day,\u201d he pointed out.  \u201cWe should put the repeal forward that we voted on a year ago, and that passed unanimously. Put it on, and the same day, let\u2019s put up replacement,\u201d Paul recommended. \u201cNow, what House leadership will tell you is, you probably won\u2019t get to 60 votes. I can\u2019t guarantee 60 votes. All I can guarantee is what we\u2019re for. We should put it forward, and if Democrats block replacement, they still own the whole thing. \u201d Paul agreed with Kassam that many Republicans do not seem to understand they hold the high ground on Obamacare repeal and could make Democrats pay a political price for interfering with vitally needed measures to deal with the failing program. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand that yet. I\u2019m still trying to get that through to them,\u201d said Paul. \u201cI am for replacement. I do want to pass replacement  \u2014   but if they don\u2019t, instead of Republicans fighting with each other, why don\u2019t we make sure that the Democrats still are responsible? If they choose to block replacement, they\u2019re still responsible. \u201d \u201cI think we could pass replacement, though. I think there actually are some Democrats who will come around,\u201d he predicted. \u201cSome of these ideas are really reasonable. For example, what if we put up the individual idea that every patient in America should be allowed to join a healthcare association? We expand healthcare associations in one vote. That\u2019s a tough vote for Democrats to say they\u2019re against the consumer to join a buying group to get a lower price and to get guaranteed issue. \u201d \u201cThis is the other thing nobody understands,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cThey think you have to mandate guaranteed issue  \u2014   you know, that you can buy insurance after you\u2019re sick by law. The other way you do it is you let people get group insurance. You join a   you join the health buying group, and when you buy it, you have group insurance. Group insurance is protected, and if you get group insurance, you will not be let go. Your prices will not go up. \u201d  Paul predicted such a reform would \u201ccompletely transform\u201d the    company relationship. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re part of a   buying group. Now you have enormous leverage, so instead of us kissing the boots of the insurance executives, it\u2019ll be the opposite. The insurance executives will be begging to talk to our person, whoever\u2019s in charge of this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I promise you, whether you make $30, 000 or you make $100, 000 in our country, people don\u2019t like the way they\u2019re being treated by the health insurance companies. \u201d He said that under Ryancare, insurance companies would \u201ccontinue to lose money, but Ryan\u2019s going to give them a backstop, a bailout. \u201d  \u201cThe chronic insurance company bailout that was in Obamacare is still in this new Obamacare Lite bill,\u201d Paul said. He also expressed strong support for tort reform as part of a plan to bring medical costs down. \u201cI\u2019m a physician,\u201d he reminded the audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try to stop the frivolous lawsuits, not only for the expense of them, but everybody orders about a million too many test, because they\u2019re afraid of being sued. We need to fix that. \u201d  \u201cUnfortunately  \u2014   or fortunately, depending on how you look at it  \u2014   that probably has to be done at the state capitols, because people get sued at the state courts, and the state courts are under the purview of state law,\u201d he added. \u201cSome states have fixed this, frankly, or made it a lot better. They have review panels. They have caps on damages. I don\u2019t know if any have   but I like the   aspect also. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
