After a lockdown that lasted throughout the morning, the Los Angeles police said that the gunman was among the dead, and declared the campus safe. \u201cA homicide and a suicide occurred,\u201d Charlie Beck, the Los Angeles police chief, said. \u201cIt appears it is entirely contained. We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to U. C. L. A.\u2019s campus. \u201d A gun was found at the scene, and Chief Beck said, \u201cThere is evidence there that could be a suicide note. \u201d The shooting victim was William S. Klug, an associate professor in U. C. L. A.\u2019s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, said Alan Garfinkel, a professor of integrative biology and physiology who worked closely with Mr. Klug for the past five years. Mr. Garfinkel, who was attending a meeting in a nearby building when the shooting occurred, said he had been informed of Mr. Klug\u2019s death by Los Angeles and campus police officers. \u201cHe was an extremely sweet and kind person,\u201d Mr. Garfinkel said. \u201cIt\u2019s so   that this happened to him of all people. \u201d He described Mr. Klug as a devout Christian, adding that the two would often have debates in front of students about ethics and religion. The shooting took place about 10 a. m. inside a small office in the Engineering IV building, officials said. There were hundreds of people in the building at the time. The campus was placed on lockdown, with text message and email alerts sent out to students and employees telling them to shelter in place or, if they were in the open, to find shelter. It was not until more than two hours later that the authorities declared the situation was resolved and officials began to lift the lockdown. Earlier, police officers went building by building, escorting groups of people out who had their hands raised. The people then knelt on the ground as officers searched their backpacks and purses for weapons. Melanie Beecher, a   student, said she had reached her philosophy class shortly after receiving the first alert. \u201cImmediately we barricaded the doors, blocked openings with trash cans, turned off the lights and pulled down the blinds,\u201d she said. Ms. Beecher added that she had called friends who had not yet arrived, telling them to stay in their dormitories. \u201cWe have been getting frequent alerts and have been able to live stream the news,\u201d she said. The lockdown meant that any student who left a dorm room was unable to   it, even with a key. \u201cOur R. A. has instructed us to stay in our rooms no matter what,\u201d said Izzy Gardner, a   student who spent the time in her room. \u201cThere are tons of rumors going around, and it\u2019s hard to determine what is true and isn\u2019t true. People are pretty shaken up. \u201d Ceci Falktoft, another   student, was walking to a meeting with a professor when she saw people running, she said. Without knowing why, she ran, too, learning about the shooting after she asked others what was happening. Ms. Falktoft ran to Powell Library, where staff members handed out snacks to the many people hiding or studying there and told them they could not leave. All classes and   activities were canceled for the rest of the day Wednesday. But Scott Waugh, U. C. L. A\u2019s executive vice chancellor, said he wanted to resume normal routines as quickly as possible, especially because this is a crucial time of year for many students, with finals coming up, followed shortly thereafter by commencement. Classes will resume on Thursday, he said, and professional counselors would be available on campus. The Los Angeles police, the university police, the F. B. I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives responded to the incident. Hundreds of law enforcement officers scoured the building where the shooting occurred and surrounding buildings.'"}, "time": 1742562301.881637}
