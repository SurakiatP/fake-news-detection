[In an interview with CBS News, Saenz said Trump\u2019s border wall plan is \u201cdivisive\u201d because of its physical appearance and the \u201cpsychological impact\u201d it will have on tourists visiting Laredo.  \u201cIt serves as a negative psychological impact on people that visit our city,\u201d Saenz told CBS. \u201cCould you imagine having a city with a huge wall there? It\u2019s not very inviting. It\u2019s very divisive. \u201d Saenz\u2019s town of Laredo sits right on the   Border and is a   area for not only illegal aliens, but the Mexican drug trade as well. As Breitbart Texas reported, Laredo is one of the main hubs for drug smuggling by the Los Zetas Cartel, sitting just north of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, often considered the \u201chome base\u201d of the criminal organization. The CBS News piece also makes a point to portray border walls as not necessarily working, in terms of keeping illegal immigrants out of the country and preventing an   of drugs, titling the piece \u201cCritics on why building a Mexico border wall won\u2019t be effective. \u201d Unlike local Democratic politicians like Saenz opposing the border wall, U. S. Border Patrol agents have praised Trump\u2019s immediate action at the border, as Breitbart Texas reported. \u201cWe know we won\u2019t have a wall along the 2, 000 miles of border,\u201d the President of the Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council Hector Garza said. \u201cWhat we will have is a wall where it is needed. That barrier with proper manpower, resources, technology and other tools will be effective. But most important, for the first time we have a president that wants to secure the border. \u201d John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
