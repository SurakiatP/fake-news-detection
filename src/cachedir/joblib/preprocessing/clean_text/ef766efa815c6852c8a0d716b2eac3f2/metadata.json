During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that \u2013 Trump was bribing the media \u2013 at least that\u2019s the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. \\nIn her memoire \u201cSettle for More,\u201d which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\u201d That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion: \\nThe worst and most controversial of which was this: \\nAs the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn\u2019t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. \\nWhile Kelly couldn\u2019t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn\u2019t work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. \\n\u201cThis is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,\u201d Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, \u201cThis is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking.\u201d \\n\u201cTrump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,\u201d she said. \\nWhen it became obvious that some reporters were \u201cin the tank\u201d for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, \u201ccertain TV hosts\u201d would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn\u2019t identify them by name or media outlet. \\nSource: Yahoo \\nKelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump\u2019s treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water . \\nWhile bribing journalists isn\u2019t illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible. \\nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Share this Article!
