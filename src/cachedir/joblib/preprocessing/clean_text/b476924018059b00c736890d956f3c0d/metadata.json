Imam Suhaib Webb, a Muslim leader in Washington, has held live monthly video chats to refute the religious claims of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In a dig at the extremists, he broadcast from ice cream parlors and called his talks \u201cISIS and ice cream. \u201d Sheikh Hamza Yusuf, an American Muslim scholar based in Berkeley, Calif. has pleaded with Muslims not to be deceived by the \u201cstupid young boys\u201d of the Islamic State. Millions have watched excerpts from his sermon titled \u201cThe Crisis of ISIS,\u201d in which he wept as he asked God not to blame other Muslims \u201cfor what these fools amongst us do. \u201d It is a religious rumble that barely makes headlines in the secular West since it is carried out at mosques and Islamic conferences and over social media. The Islamic State, however, has taken notice. The group recently threatened the lives of 11 Muslim imams and scholars in the West, calling them \u201capostates\u201d who should be killed. The recent issue of the Islamic State\u2019s online propaganda magazine, Dabiq, called them \u201cobligatory targets,\u201d and it said that supporters should use any weapons on hand to \u201cmake an example of them. \u201d The danger is real enough that the F. B. I. has contacted some of those named in the Islamic State\u2019s magazine \u201cto assist them in taking proper steps to ensure their safety,\u201d said Andrew Ames, a spokesman for the F. B. I. \u2019s field office in Washington. The death threats are a sign that Muslim religious leaders have antagonized the Islamic State, according to analysts who are studying the militant group. Their growing influence also contradicts those who claim that Muslim leaders have been silent in the fight against violent extremism. \u201cThis is what hurts ISIS the most. It is Muslims speaking out,\u201d said Mubin Shaikh, a Canadian who once joined an extremist Islamist group and now advises governments on countering radicalization. \u201c  is what ISIS is trying to do, whether to silence these people or to silence others as a deterrent. \u201d Several of the targeted Muslim leaders said in interviews that, while they were taking the threat seriously, they had no intention of backing off. They have hired security guards and fortified their workplaces, and some keep guns at home. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be denounced by ISIS,\u201d said Imam Webb, who frequently engages young Muslims over social media, whether on YouTube, Facebook, Periscope or Snapchat. \u201cI consider it one of my greatest accomplishments in life. \u201d \u201cIt has only reinvigorated me,\u201d he said, \u201cto provide the antivenom to the poison of ISIS. \u201d These Muslim leaders say they are responding to fellow believers who are looking for a religiously based rebuke to violent movements that claim to be acting in the name of Islam. They say that extremist groups like the Islamic State are a threat not just to civil society and security, but to the future of their faith. Sheikh Yasir Qadhi, who is based in Tennessee and runs a popular Islamic educational institute, thundered against the Islamic State in a Friday sermon at one of Europe\u2019s largest mosques in March, only three days after the group\u2019s suicide bombers had attacked the Brussels airport and train station. \u201cNone of our senior scholars of any school  \u2014   any school  \u2014   has justified these deeds,\u201d Sheikh Qadhi said at the East London Mosque. He argued that the terrorist attacks of recent years had clearly violated Islamic teaching because they \u201ccause more harm than good,\u201d bringing more bombs, more drones and more chaos to Muslim communities, he said. \u201cWho has benefited? Please use the intelligence that Allah gave you,\u201d he said. \u201cThese radical groups have harmed the image of Islam infinitely more than all of the foreign policy of Western lands combined. \u201d These scholars ridicule the Islamic State\u2019s claim to have created a \u201ccaliphate\u201d ruled by a successor to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Instead, in a highly effective bit of rebranding, they call the Islamic State Kharijites, a reviled group of Muslims who killed women and children and rebelled against the caliphs in the seventh century. The imams named by the Islamic State are based in the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia. They represent a broad spectrum of Islamic thought  \u2014   from spiritual Sufis to puritanical Salafis, and even the more militant \u201cSalafi Jihadis. \u201d To the Islamic State\u2019s propagandists, it does not matter that the imams are fervent Muslims or critics of American foreign policy: They are all \u201cunbelievers,\u201d just like the Shiite Muslims, Christians and Yazidis that the Islamic State has killed by the thousands in Iraq, Libya, Syria and elsewhere. This is not the first time that the Islamic State has targeted Muslim leaders in the United States, but this is the longest list yet. It includes Sheikh Hisham Kabbani, a Lebanese Sufi now based mostly in Michigan who has been warning for years about rising extremism. The list also includes   preachers such as Bilal Philips, a Canadian convert who has been barred from several countries because of allegations that he preaches extremism Tawfique Chowdhury, an Australian doctor who founded organizations and charities that propagate orthodox views of Islam and Abu Basir   a Syrian preacher based in London who has spoken in support of Al Qaeda, according to news reports. Cole Bunzel, a scholar at Princeton University studying Islamic history and jihadist ideology, said, \u201cWhat ISIS is saying is that even if you support Al Qaeda, even if you\u2019re a supporter of someone like Tartusi, you\u2019re still not on team Islam. \u201d The Islamic State\u2019s magazine also targeted American Muslims in government, such as Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota Huma Abedin, a longtime top aide to Hillary Clinton and Mohamed Elibiary, a Texas Republican and former adviser to the Department of Homeland Security. Several terrorism experts said that an attack on any of these people was more likely to happen abroad than in the United States, but that all it would take is one deluded or mentally unbalanced \u201clone wolf. \u201d In March, a popular Saudi preacher, Sheikh Aaidh   was shot and wounded by a gunman in the Philippines, soon after the Islamic State\u2019s online magazine had put him on a list of \u201capostate\u201d Saudi scholars. Sheikh Qarni, who writes Islamic inspirational books and has nearly 13 million followers on Twitter, had just given a lecture at Western Mindanao State University, and his assailant was an engineering student. The effort to undermine the Islamic State using religion is not just a Western phenomenon. In January, Muslim leaders from around the world gathered in Morocco and produced the Marrakesh Declaration, which denounces Muslim oppression of religious minorities. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which represents 57 Muslim countries, recently endorsed the declaration. Sheikh Hamza will soon air a television series in the Middle East, \u201cRihla With Sheikh Hamza Yusuf\u201d (rihla is \u201cquest\u201d in Arabic). The show applies traditional Islamic scholarship to contemporary challenges in the Muslim world, and it includes strong messages against extremism  \u2014   which Sheikh Hamza said amounts to \u201cswatting the hornet\u2019s nest again. \u201d It is likely to be seen in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State\u2019s strongholds, he said. Sheikh Qadhi, however, said that, based on several frightening experiences recently in Tennessee, he has more to fear from     than from adherents of the Islamic State. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of ISIS in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel very safe in every mosque I go to. But I am scared of other people in this land who are very ignorant and bigoted. \u201d He said he had gotten used to being vilified by both sides: \u201cThe right wing is calling me a stealth jihadist. And ISIS is calling me a sellout. We challenge both of their narratives, even as their narratives feed into each other. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563315.920912}
