Mike Lee ( ) predicted the legislation scheduled for a vote Thursday that would begin the process of repealing Obamacare would fail because he argued it not only didn\u2019t have the votes in the Senate but the House as well.  \u201cThis bill is going to fail,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is going to fail because it doesn\u2019t have enough support in the House of Representatives and it doesn\u2019t have enough support in the Senate. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a whole lot of people  \u2014   enough people that I know that it is going to fall short of a majority in the House and it\u2019s going to fall short of a majority in the Senate,\u201d he added. \u201cLook, if they know something that I don\u2019t, perhaps they\u2019ll be smiling 24 hours from now. But if they\u2019re so confident, they\u2019re not going to need to worry about my vote, they\u2019re not going to need to worry about the votes of a whole lot of other people in the House and in the Senate who are concerned that this bill doesn\u2019t do what we promise to do, which was repeal Obamacare in its entirety. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561762.6554284}
