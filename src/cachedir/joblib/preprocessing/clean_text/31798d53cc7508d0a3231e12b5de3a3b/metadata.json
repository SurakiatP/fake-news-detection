The court\u2019s brief order included no reasoning. North Carolina\u2019s law, which imposed an array of voting restrictions, including new voter identification requirements, was enacted by the state\u2019s   legislature in 2013. It was part of a wave of voting restrictions enacted after a    Supreme Court decision that effectively struck down a central part of the federal Voting Rights Act, weakening federal oversight of voting rights. Challenges to the laws have met with considerable success in recent months, and Wednesday\u2019s development suggested that the current   Supreme Court is not likely to undo those victories. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican who is seeking   this fall, asserted that North Carolina had \u201cbeen denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 states. \u201d He noted that four justices had supported the state\u2019s position and that \u201cfour liberal justices blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws. \u201d The law\u2019s critics welcomed the order. \u201cThis decision opens the door for fair and full access to the democratic process for all voters,\u201d said Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. \u201cHundreds of thousands of North Carolinians will now be able to vote without barriers. The voting booth is the one place where everyone is equal and where we all have the same say. \u201d Civil rights groups joined with the Obama administration in filing suit against the law, arguing that, several parts of the law violated the Constitution and what remained of the Voting Rights Act. A trial judge rejected those claims in April, but in July a   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. disagreed. The appeals court ruling struck down five parts of the law: its voter ID requirements, a rollback of early voting to 10 days from 17, an elimination of   registration and of preregistration of some teenagers, and its ban on counting votes cast in the wrong precinct. The court found that all five restrictions \u201cdisproportionately affected African Americans. \u201d The law\u2019s voter identification provision, for instance, \u201cretained only those types of photo ID disproportionately held by whites and excluded those disproportionately held by African Americans. \u201d This was so, the court said, even though the state had \u201cfailed to identify even a single individual who has ever been charged with committing   voter fraud in North Carolina. \u201d But it did find that there is evidence of fraud in absentee voting by mail, a method used disproportionately by white voters. But the Legislature exempted absentee voting from the photo ID requirement. The court also found that the early voting restrictions had a much larger effect on black voters, who \u201cdisproportionately used the first seven days of early voting. \u201d The law, the court said, eliminated one of two \u201c   \u201d Sundays when black churches provided rides to polling places. In an emergency application filed 17 days after the appeals court ruling, state officials asked the Supreme Court to step in. Represented by Paul D. Clement, a former United States solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, the officials challenged only the parts of the appeals court\u2019s ruling that they said would create confusion in the coming election. The state officials asked the justices to temporarily restore three parts of the law: its   requirements, the reduction of early voting days and preregistration of some teenagers. In response, the Obama administration and civil rights groups said the state had moved too slowly to challenge the appeals court\u2019s ruling and that undoing it would lead to mistakes and confusion. They added that the state\u2019s lawyers had earlier told the appeals court that the state could comply with a ruling so long as it was issued by late July. The appeals court ruled on July 29. Changing course now, the administration said, \u201cwould inflict irreparable injury on minority voters. \u201d The state asked the justices to act because it said the appeals court\u2019s approach would \u201cthreaten voter ID laws throughout the nation. \u201d The Obama administration responded that the appeal\u2019s court\u2019s ruling rested on \u201ca careful appraisal of overwhelming evidence specific to North Carolina. \u201d \u201cThe only voter ID laws that the decision endangers are those proven through overwhelming evidence to have been adopted with racially discriminatory intent,\u201d the brief said. \u201cThis is a case about the use of race to achieve partisan ends. \u201d Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted to reject the state\u2019s arguments. Justice Clarence Thomas would have revived all of the contested provisions, while Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. would have reinstated the voter ID and early voting provisions. \u201cThis ruling means that thousands of voters who would have been disenfranchised will now be able to participate in the presidential election,\u201d said Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project, which represented several plaintiffs in the case. Republican supporters of the tightened standards, who had suggested that the appeals court\u2019s judges might have been intending \u201cto reopen the door for voter fraud,\u201d took a measured tone on Wednesday. \u201cWe respect the court, but are disappointed North Carolina will not be among the more than 30 other states with commonsense voter ID in place for the upcoming election,\u201d House Speaker Tim Moore and Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate, said in a joint statement.'"}, "time": 1742563979.1877148}
