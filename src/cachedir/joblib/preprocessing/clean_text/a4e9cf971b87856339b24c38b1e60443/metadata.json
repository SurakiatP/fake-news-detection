[\u201c[Warmbier\u2019s release] means that the administration is working hard on these cases,\u201d Laurie Holt told Fox News. \u201cAnything they can do to further the process along would be great because if we don\u2019t get him out soon, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see him alive again. \u201d  Holt\u2019s comments come after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that North Korean authorities had released Warmbier, despite having sentenced the student to 15 years of hard labor for \u201chostile acts\u201d after stealing   propaganda signs from his hotel. Warmbier had reportedly fallen into a coma in March 2016, shortly after his arrest, and U. S. officials demand his release on humanitarian grounds, which Pyongyang conceded. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that securing Warmbier\u2019s release had been a \u201cbig priority for the president. \u201d Joshua Holt, a former Mormon missionary from Utah, was arrested in Venezuela last June along with his wife Thamara Cale\u00f1o after officials claimed to have found a small weapons arsenal in their apartment. They remain imprisoned despite eyewitnesses revealing they had seen police planting the weapons beforehand. In December, Venezuelan authorities repeatedly denied Holt\u2019s attorney the right to see him, as prosecutors pressed charges against him and Cale\u00f1o for terrorism and illegal possession of arms. According to a report from the Miami Herald earlier this week, President Donald Trump has now taken a \u201cpersonal interest\u201d in his case. The report also noted that Holt has become \u201cdepressed and angry\u201d in prison and \u201chas no hope whatsoever that he will ever be free from there. \u201d Since entering the jail, Holt\u2019s health has significantly deteriorated, having lost 50 pounds and developing kidney stones, bronchitis, and internal bleeding, with his family claiming his life is at risk. \u201cThe hardest part for me is that he told his    to tell me to go on with my life and forget about him because he feels like he is never going to get out,\u201d Laurie Holt said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do that. \u201d She also says her son has been routinely tortured by Venezuelan authorities, who force him to perform gym exercises naked in the prison\u2019s hallways, which required Holt to violate Mormon practices of modesty around others. Venezuela enjoys alliances with some of America\u2019s most vocal enemies, including the rogue nations of North Korea and Iran, who have routinely imprisoned Americans in search of government ransoms. North Korea is currently holding three U. S. citizens following Warmbier\u2019s release. Iran is holding at least two U. S. citizens, while a third disappeared in the country years ago. The Trump administration has prioritized securing the release of U. S. prisoners abroad. So far, at least two such detentions have successfully concluded: American businesswoman Sandy   who the Chinese government accused of spying, and Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker freed from Egypt after she was cleared of child abuse and human trafficking charges.
