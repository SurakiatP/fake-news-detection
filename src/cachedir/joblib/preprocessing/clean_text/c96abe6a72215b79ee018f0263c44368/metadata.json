[Many of the regulations were promulgated late in President Barack Obama\u2019s term, in the hope of locking the incoming Trump administration into   policies it would not be able to reverse.  Former Interior Department Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement director Joe Pizarchik told Politico that Congress had \u201cignored the will of the people\u201d in repealing regulations such as a restriction on mountaintop coal mining that he had championed. But critics would argue that the proliferation of such regulations, made and enforced by unelected bureaucrats, is precisely why Trump won in the first place. The Congressional Review Act was passed after New Gingrich\u2019s 1994 Republican Revolution precisely to act as a break on a runaway federal bureaucracy. Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal pointed out last month that while the law is usually reserved for regulations passed in the previous 60 days, it actually allows Congress to repeal many of the regulations that were created under Obama over the past eight years, because the federal agencies never reported their regulations to Congress: Here\u2019s how it works: It turns out that the first line of the CRA requires any federal agency promulgating a rule to submit a \u201creport\u201d on it to the House and Senate. The   clock starts either when the rule is published or when Congress receives the report \u2014  whichever comes later. \u201cThere was always intended to be consequences if agencies didn\u2019t deliver these reports,\u201d Mr. [Todd] Gaziano of the [Pacific Legal Foundation] tells me. \u201cAnd while some Obama agencies may have been better at sending reports, others, through incompetence or spite, likely didn\u2019t. \u201d Bottom line: There are rules for which there are no reports. And if the Trump administration were now to submit those reports \u2014  for rules implemented long ago \u2014  Congress would be free to vote the regulations down. There\u2019s more. It turns out the CRA has a expansive definition of what counts as a \u201crule\u201d \u2014  and it isn\u2019t limited to those published in the Federal Register. The CRA also applies to \u201cguidance\u201d that agencies issue. Think the Obama administration\u2019s controversial guidance on transgender bathrooms in schools or on Title IX and campus sexual assault. It is highly unlikely agencies submitted reports to lawmakers on these actions. On January 30, President Trump issued an executive order providing \u201cthat for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination. \u201d Joel B.
