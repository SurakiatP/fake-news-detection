As if that and the fact that it falls on a Monday didn\u2019t suck all the fun out of Halloween this year, Katy Perry has ruined the holiday for everyone with her Hillary Clinton disguise. \\nIt reportedly took makeup artists six hours to apply the necessary prosthetics to simulate the aging effect of decades of scandals, and in the end, they ended up with \u2026 Jay Leno in a blonde wig?
