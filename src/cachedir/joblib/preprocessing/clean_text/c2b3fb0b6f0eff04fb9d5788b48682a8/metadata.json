And, once again, we\u2019re learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices. As FBI Director James Comey announced Friday, a new investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal has been launched, just days before the presidential election. Comey\u2019s move drew fire instantly from the Democrats who claim Comey is attempting to sway the election in Donald Trump\u2019s favor. While many are focused on Comey\u2019s actions and renewed investigation, Wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of state\u2019s emails. \\nAccording to former State Department official Tom Nides, in a 2015 email to John Podesta (Clinton campaign manager), everyone in Obama\u2019s cabinet and every White House staffer uses their personal email for government business. Nides should know as he worked under Hillary Clinton in the State Department from 2011 to 2013, according to one source . \\nWhile keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply don\u2019t care, ALL correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records. \\nThe Federal Records Act defines a record as anything, \u201cregardless of whether it exists in physical, digital, or electronic form, is a record as defined in subsection (a) shall be binding on all Federal agencies.\u201d This includes all communication of state agents (like the POTUS) who work in the executive branch of government, as well. \\nBut the Obama administration, according to Nides, has long since avoided the Federal Records Act by using private Gmail accounts. Nides wrote Podesta and said, \u201cThere is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing. (Which I am sure nobody wants to do). Get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones.\u201d That admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the Federal Records Act. But it was Nides\u2019 next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets. \\nNides wrote, \u201cBtw you know as well as I every god damn cabinet officer and WH staff uses their [sic] gmail account!\u201d The former Department of State employee revealed what many already suspected. The Obama administration is anything but transparent. Just ask Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. His organization routinely sues the Obama administration in federal court using the Freedom of Information Act as warrant for inquiry, and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn. Fitton\u2019s organization gave the Obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when Bush was president. \\nFitton wrote in 2015 , \u201cThere are about 18 lawsuits, 10 of which are active in federal court, and about 160 Judicial Watch FOIA requests that could be affected by Mrs. Clinton and her staff\u2019s use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business. In our various FOIA lawsuits, our lawyers have informed attorneys for the Obama administration that Hillary Clinton\u2019s account and any other secret accounts used by State employees should be secured, recovered and searched.\u201d JW actively seeks out those files through official methods, using FOIA and the Federal Records Act, but has been met with delay after delay from FOIA requests to the Obama administration. \\nWhile the Obama administration is on its way out, groups like Judicial Watch aren\u2019t going anywhere, and presumably have all the time in the world to FOIA their way into digging up those deleted Clinton emails, as well as securing Gmail accounts from the Obama administration cabinet and staffers. This story is definitely a long way from being over. \\nIt\u2019s no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines they\u2019re being told. With the president and all his men (and women), hiding their communications within their Gmail accounts, the truth is never going to be told, at least not the real truth. And by the time organizations like Judicial Watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people, it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Julian Assange, we salute you. Thank you for forcing the Obama administration to be transparent. Keep up the valiant work!  '"}, "time": 1742628548.1967926}
