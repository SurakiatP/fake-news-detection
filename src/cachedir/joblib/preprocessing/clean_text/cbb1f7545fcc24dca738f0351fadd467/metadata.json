[\u201cI\u2019m more optimistic than I\u2019ve ever been since I\u2019ve been in public life,\u201d the former vice president said in a video announcing the Biden Foundation.  \u201cWe\u2019re better positioned than any country in the world to lead the world in the 21st century  \u2014   not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example,\u201d he said. The foundation will be headquartered in Washington, D. C. but will be incorporated in Delaware, the Washington Post reported. Unlike the Clinton Foundation, the Biden Foundation will not accept money from foreign citizens or entities, but it will accept money from private and corporate foundations, according to a foundation representative who spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue before the official announcement. \u201cWe look forward to this new chapter where we will continue our work to ensure that everyone  \u2014   no matter their income level, race, gender, age, or sexuality  \u2014   is treated with dignity and gets a fair shot at achieving the American Dream,\u201d Biden and the former second lady said in a statement released Wednesday. The foundation\u2019s board of directors will be made up of former Sen. Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden adviser Valerie Biden Owens, Biden\u2019s sister Mark Gitenstein, a former Biden aide who later was ambassador to Romania Mark Angelson, another veteran Biden adviser and Jeff Peck of Peck, Madigan, and Jones who also worked for Biden on Capitol Hill, according to Politico. Louisa Terrell, who previously worked for Biden in the Senate, was Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s former chief of staff, lobbied for Facebook, and most recently served as adviser to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, will be the foundation\u2019s executive director.'"}, "time": 1742561936.0177574}
