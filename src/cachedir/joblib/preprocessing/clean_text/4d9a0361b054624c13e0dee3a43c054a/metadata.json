The FBI is taking another look at her emails \u2014 which could likely end her. Media rushed to the runway after her arrival, where cameras caught what she tried to hide outside her private airplane. \\nThe FBI announced that they are looking into Hillary\u2019s previously undisclosed emails as she was mid-air and blissfully unaware and unable to prepare. Knowing what\u2019s in those documents, she\u2019s more aware of the ramifications than the rest of us, but because it was sprung on her, she wasn\u2019t fully prepared for questions about it since she requires practiced answers that she receives ahead of time before talking to the public. \\nHowever, forced to face the music upon landing, Hillary couldn\u2019t escape the press pool waiting for her as she made a beeline for her getaway car from the airplane. That\u2019s when she did something very telling of her guilt.

Our guess is, she had a moment of meltdown with the news, screamed, yelled, and then was given a shot of her favorite liquor before exiting the aircraft, where she was met with a barrage of questions about the investigation. Rather than responding, which an innocent person would do, she flashed a fake smile and wave and didn\u2019t say a single word. \\nIt would take too much explanation to lie, and she\u2019d only further incriminate herself, so she gave the press the silent treatment instead, which actually spoke volumes. No matter how much Hillary ignores this, it\u2019s not going away, as the truth will prevail against her and, hopefully, land her in the jailhouse \u2014 not the White House.'"}, "time": 1742561900.9968855}
