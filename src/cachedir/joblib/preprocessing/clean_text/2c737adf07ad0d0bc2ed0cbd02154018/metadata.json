[In his weekly \u201cGeneral Audience\u201d before thousands of pilgrims Wednesday, the Pope underscored the interpersonal aspect of Christianity as faith in the person of Jesus Christ as savior and revealer of the Father.  Reflecting on the witness of Saint Paul, Francis noted that Christian faith is not the outcome of a reflection of some wise person, but a simple fact that intervened in the lives of some people. Christianity, he said, \u201cis not an ideology or a philosophical system, but it is a journey of faith which starts from an event, witnessed by the first disciples of Jesus. \u201d \u201cPaul sums it up this way: Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day he rose again and appeared to Peter and to the Twelve,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cThis is the fact: he died, was buried, is risen and has appeared. That is, Jesus is alive!\u201d \u201cThis is the core of the Christian message,\u201d Francis said. The Pope insisted that Christ\u2019s resurrection was central to the preaching of the early Christian community, because it highlighted the sense that death did not have the final word. If everything were over with Christ\u2019s death, Francis reasoned, he would have given an example of supreme dedication, but he would not move us to faith in Him. He would have been one more hero to admire. \u201cNo!\u201d Francis said. \u201cHe died but rose again. \u201d Faith, he said, \u201cis born from the resurrection. To accept that Christ died on the cross is not an act of faith it is a historical fact. Believing that he rose, on the other hand, is an act of faith. \u201d The Christian faith \u201cwas born on Easter morning,\u201d Francis asserted. For his part, Saint Paul \u201cwas a persecutor of the Church, proud of his convictions he felt like a man who had made it, with very clear idea of \\u200b\\u200bwhat life was about and what his duties were. \u201d But, in this perfect picture \u201cone day something happened that was completely unpredictable: the encounter with the Risen Jesus on the road to Damascus,\u201d he said. This event revolutionized his life, and \u201cthe persecutor became an apostle. \u201d The reason for Paul\u2019s  ? \u201cBecause I have seen Jesus alive! I have seen the risen Jesus Christ! This is the foundation of Paul\u2019s faith, of the faith of the other Apostles, of the faith of the Church and of our faith,\u201d Francis said. \u201cSo, even though we are sinners \u2014  as we all are \u2014  and if our good intentions have remained on paper,\u201d Francis said, all is not lost. Like those people mentioned in the Gospel, we can \u201cgo to the tomb of Christ, see the large overturned stone and think that God is preparing an unexpected future for me, for all of us. \u201d \u201cGod is bigger than nothingness, and you just need a candle to defeat the darkest of nights,\u201d he said. Paul cried, \u201cWhere, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?\u201d In these days of Easter, we carry this cry in our heart, Francis said. \u201cAnd if we are asked the reason for our smile and our patient sharing, then we can answer that Jesus is still here, and continues to live among us,\u201d he said.
