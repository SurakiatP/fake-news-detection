Part of his bakery\u2019s ceiling remains caved in where it was hit by a rocket during the latest Taliban siege. In another corner of the city, Abdul Rassoul, 65, comes in after life has gone. He digs graves and then waters the trees that dot the cemetery. He also chases away addicts trying to steal a grave railing, or shepherd boys whose herds stumble on the graves  \u2014   pelting them with rocks and cursing them. Both men wake up around 3 a. m. when the rest of Kunduz\u2019s residents are fast asleep, barring just a few. Their everyday lives are woven into a larger pattern of hardship and resilience in the city. The bullet holes in the walls after each siege  \u2014   two Taliban takeovers in just over a year  \u2014   are reminders that it could easily happen again, and most likely will. So the people of Kunduz try to shrug it off as just another disruption in a long stream of them. After their awakening in the dark, Mr. Mohammed and his two bakery workers work through two sacks of flour, about 150 pounds in total, as they begin preparing their first batch of dough. Among the few other residents up with them then is an elderly night watchman on their block who has walked for hours among the closed shops along the way  \u2014   construction materials, polished window frames, medicines. After handing his watch shift over to his son, he curls up in a corner of the bakery to sleep, warmed by a blanket and the oven\u2019s warmth as the baking begins. Allowing the dough time to rise, the bakers start the fire in the oven as the call for dawn prayer begins to echo in the city. At each meal, they will sell about 500 flat loaves, each for 10 afghanis, or about 15 cents. When the Taliban overran parts of the city again in October and heavy fighting broke out, sales dropped away. Even hungry, most wouldn\u2019t dare cross the street. \u201cThey said the Taliban had taken the main roundabout, but I didn\u2019t believe them,\u201d said Ghulam Rasoul, 27, one of the bakery workers. \u201cWhen the Taliban came here to buy bread, I said, \u2018O. K. the city has fallen. \u2019\u201d Many bakers around the city increased the price of bread then, trying to make a profit in desperate times  \u2014   or because the cost of ingredients had gone up. Mr. Mohammed said he held firm, though. For the three days of fighting that he remained open before the rocket damaged the roof and forced him to close shop for a while, he said he kept the price at 15 cents. \u201cHow could I do that? If I increase the price in difficult days, how could I look the people in the eye the day after?\u201d Mr. Mohammed said. The same understanding prevailed at the cemetery in those tough days, where few bodies arrived for burial while the fighting persisted. Among the handful of dead the gravedigger buried during the   siege were three drug addicts who had stayed on the streets and been shot. Someone took them to the cemetery on the back of a motorcycle wagon. \u201cWe buried them for free,\u201d said Mohammed Massoud, the gravedigger\u2019s    son and helper. \u201cWhat can one get from an addict?\u201d The fighting did not change the gravedigger\u2019s routine much. At 3 a. m. with the sound of bullets cracking in the morning calm, Mr. Rassoul would wake up his son and the two would make their way to the cemetery. They wanted to be there first, ready in case an early burial was needed. Some nights, Mr. Rassoul sleeps in the back seat of a damaged truck at the back of the cemetery, to make sure he is at work as early as possible. On a normal day, they charge $20 a grave. They have dug them for all kinds of people: four members of a family who died in an avalanche two brothers who drowned on their way to Europe a    Pashtun man named Gul Ahmad who died in an American military bombing. Mr. Ahmad\u2019s gravestone is adorned by a daring, but plagiarized, poem. I, Gul Ahmad, will rise in my shroud  If I learn that a Pashtun has become the slave of others. One time, they had dug a grave for an Afghan soldier killed on a southern battlefield, but the body did not arrive for 16 days. On the 14th day, they gave the grave to another family, and they dug a new one for the soldier when he finally arrived. Another time, a woman came and asked if they could unearth her husband\u2019s body, dead for years, because she had dreamed he was alive. \u201cWho unearths a grave?\u201d the young Massoud asked with astonishment. \u201cThe dead will just drag you in. \u201d One Tuesday morning, a little baby  \u2014   just three days old  \u2014   was brought to be buried. About two dozen men arrived in a small convoy. The baby\u2019s father, a preacher, took off his shoes and socks and got down into the grave to place the tiny body, wrapped in a prayer rug. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s child passes away and he shows patience, God will give him a palace made of glass in paradise,\u201d the father said in his sermon once the men were done shoveling the dirt. \u201cIt\u2019s built of glass  \u2014   you can see its inside from outside and outside from its inside. It has doors and golden beds. We don\u2019t have the ability to comprehend it now. They call it the house of thanks  \u2014   because you were thankful to God. \u201d As the convoy was leaving the area, Mr. Rassoul rushed to sprinkle some water over the new grave. He got a   tip. Soon after the burial, a young man named Noor Mohammed arrived with   rat poison called Commando. Two rats had tunneled into the grave of his brother, Baz Mohammed, an Afghan Army soldier killed in battle. He called the gravedigger over and showed him the problem and then showed him the rat poison. Mr. Rassoul objected. \u201cYou can\u2019t throw the poison on the grave,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou want to kill the rats. But what if a bird sits on the grave and eats the poison and dies? Who is responsible for that sin?\u201d Mr. Rassoul made a suggestion: Noor Mohammed should go buy a   trap and some rope, and he would take care of the rest, he told the young man. What is the rope for, Noor Mohammed asked? Mr. Rassoul explained what had happened the last time they failed to use a rope. A stray dog spied the trapped rat and hauled it away in its teeth, trap and all. Mr. Rassoul and his son had to chase the dog all through the cemetery, though in vain. Mr. Mohammed\u2019s rat trap would remain tightly roped to a railing near his brother\u2019s grave, Mr. Rassoul promised.'"}, "time": 1742628415.9235423}
