At least 30 people were missing, according to the authorities. The avalanche occurred after four earthquakes struck central Italy, which has been hit hard in recent months. Giampiero Parete, a cook at the Rigopiano hotel and one of the two known survivors, had gone out to get something from his car when the avalanche struck. His wife and two young children remained inside and are among the missing. Quintino Marcella, a restaurateur, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he had received a frantic call for help from Mr. Parete on Wednesday night. Mr. Parete told him that the hotel had been wiped out: \u201cThe hotel isn\u2019t here anymore, it\u2019s not here,\u201d Mr. Marcella told the newspaper. He said that the guests had been waiting for a snow plow to clear the roads. \u201cAll the guests had their bags packed and were waiting to leave,\u201d he said. Mr. Marcella said that he called the prefecture in Pescara, and an official told him that they had spoken to the hotel a few hours earlier and that everything was under control. \u201cI insisted,\u201d Mr. Marcella told Corriere della Sera. He said that he called police, the carabinieri, until someone finally said \u201cmaybe there\u2019s something there. \u201d The authorities told the Italian media that they responded as soon as they learned of the disaster. The latest seismic activity, which prompted officials to close schools and the subway system in Rome as a precaution, shifted the nation\u2019s attention back to areas in central Italy that were devastated by last year\u2019s earthquakes, leading to criticism that victims had been left to fend for themselves. Fabrizio Curcio, the chief of the civil protection department, told RAI News that    teams had reached the hotel but that they faced an enormous challenge. Rescue workers, including dog units, were moving with caution he said, and some   teams reported no signs of survivors. News channels in Italy showed images of the roof collapsed on the Rigopiano, and    photographs suggesting that much of the structure had been buried by the avalanche. The last time Fulvio Vagnarelli heard from his brother Marco, who was staying at the hotel with his girlfriend Paola Tomassini, it was via a social media message late on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cHe told me that they were about to leave but that they were delayed because of the snow,\u201d Mr. Vagnarelli told the Ansa news agency. Cars were blocking the road, \u201cand they were waiting for it to be cleared. \u201d The father of a woman who worked at the hotel told Radio24 that the staff had asked to leave after the quake \u201cbecause it was felt very strongly up there, and so they asked to come down. But there were three meters of snow, how were they supposed to leave?\u201d Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the rescue effort presented officials with \u201cunprecedented\u201d difficulties, describing the area as caught in a vise after intense snowfall \u201cthat hadn\u2019t been recorded for decades,\u201d and the strong earthquakes on Wednesday. The epicenters of the four earthquakes were in central Italy, which has been hit by deadly quakes with increasing frequency in recent years. Officials registered more than 100 aftershocks on Thursday. Emergency vehicles tried to assist mountain rescue teams in the region, part of the Gran Sasso National Park, but their efforts were hampered by heavy snow. Francesco Provolo, the prefect of Pescara, the province that includes Farindola, told RAI that rescuers had to travel more than five miles on skis and snowshoes to reach the hotel, as billowing snow continued to fall throughout the night. A spokesman for the civil protection department in Pescara estimated that up to 30 people were in the hotel at the time of the avalanche. The   hotel has 43 rooms, but it was not clear how many guests were staying there at the time of the avalanche. Rescue efforts continued at the hotel, which officials said had been swept from its foundations by the avalanche. Walter Milan, a spokesman for a specialized mountain rescue team, told RAI that rescuers were examining the scene of the avalanche section by section \u201cto exclude that people remained trapped underneath. \u201d In the nearby hamlet of Ortolano, which has been cut off by the snow, 21 people were airlifted by helicopter to the airport in L\u2019Aquila, said a spokesman for the Italian Financial Police, which was involved in the rescue operations. Three quakes in central Italy last year killed nearly 300 people in and around the medieval town of Amatrice on Wednesday, the tower of one of that town\u2019s churches was destroyed by temblors. In 2009, the town of L\u2019Aquila was devastated by an earthquake that killed more than 300 people. The latest earthquakes were a new setback for thousands of commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises in four central Italian regions that have been struggling to recover from the natural disasters of the summer and fall. Mr. Gentiloni praised the courage of rescue workers trying to reach the hotel, and he said the country\u2019s \u201cheart and mind\u201d were closely following their efforts. \u201cEveryone is doing as much as they can\u201d to reach people, clear roads and bring electricity to areas that have been cut off for days, the prime minister said. \u201cBut I ask all operators to increase their commitment. They have shown that they exist, are present, and are working  \u2014   but I ask them, if possible, to do even more. \u201d The avalanche had buried cars and nearly everything else in its path. The National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology said that more than 47, 000 temblors and aftershocks had rattled the region since August, and that there was no sign the situation would change anytime soon. After the earthquake in L\u2019Aquila in 2009, the earth shook for four years, even though it wasn\u2019t always perceptible to people, said Carlo Meletti, the director of the seismic hazard center at the institute. \u201cWe expect the sequence will last for many weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s quakes, it is as though it has picked up in vigor. \u201d \u201cWe have always said that there were strong possibilities of new, stronger earthquakes, and now a new fault has opened,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe one thing we don\u2019t know is when they will occur or where, because the area that has been affected by the quakes is so vast. \u201d Mr. Meletti said in a telephone interview that it was unclear if the avalanche was a direct result of the earthquakes on Wednesday, but that a link was possible \u201cconsidering that a lot of snow had fallen in a very short time and it was very unstable. \u201d Echoing a refrain heard after the earthquakes last year, many residents complained on social media that they had been abandoned, even as officials pledged that they were doing everything they could to reach stranded towns and hamlets. \u201cOnly the earthquake remembers the earthquake victims,\u201d a banner headline on the front page of the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano read on Thursday.'"}, "time": 1742628607.9241467}
