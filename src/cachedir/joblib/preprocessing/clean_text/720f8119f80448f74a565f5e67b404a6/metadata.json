Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. \\nUS authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News \u2019 sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an \u201cabundance of caution.\u201d \\nEarlier this week, there were also warnings that \u201cpolling places\u201d could be seen as \u201cattractive targets\u201d for \u201clone wolf\u201d attackers by individuals motivated by \u201cviolent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity.\u201d This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : \\nThe counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. \\nHowever, what\u2019s interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian \u201ccivil\u201d war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch \u2013 the al Nusra Front \u2013 in with the \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d they support. Therefore, al Qaeda\u2019s ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. \\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. \\nIt is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist \u201cbogeyman\u201d of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. \\nIt is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks\u2019 near constant releases of her campaign chair\u2019s emails, but also due to the FBI\u2019s \u201cmutiny\u201d which led them to re-open a probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. \\nHowever, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime. \\nWhat are your thoughts?
