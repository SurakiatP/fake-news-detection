But what warms the heart or initiates debate can be a matter of perspective in a sprawling event that brings together more than 200 nations and territories. There was little division on Tuesday in the Olympic Stadium, when two runners  \u2014   Abbey D\u2019Agostino of the United States and Nikki Hamblin of New Zealand  \u2014   offered a helping hand to each other after a collision in the 5, 000 meters and then urged each other on to the finish. \u201cI mean, that girl is the Olympic spirit right there,\u201d Hamblin said afterward, speaking to reporters about D\u2019Agostino. But on Sunday in the women\u2019s marathon, when the German twins and training partners Anna and Lisa Hahner decided  \u2014   spontaneously, they insist  \u2014   to join hands as they crossed the finish line deep in the pack and far from the medals, they quickly drew sharp criticism. German track and field officials accused them of publicity seeking and treating the Olympic marathon \u201clike a fun run. \u201d This is not just a German point of view, of course, but it does reflect the range of expectations as athletes navigate the cultural norms that relate to competition and sportsmanship. The Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby, who refused to shake the hand of his Israeli opponent Or Sasson, was following his nation\u2019s standards  \u2014   one that Olympic officials expressly reject. He was ejected from the Games. There was no outcry, only amusement, when David Katoatau, an exuberant weight lifter from Kiribati, danced off stage on Monday with the goal of heightening awareness of the threat posed by climate change to his tiny nation in the central Pacific Ocean. The Hahner twins had no political agenda when they joined hands to end their race, but their move, to their surprise, was still polarizing. \u201cVictory and medals are not the only goal,\u201d Thomas Kurschilgen, sports director of the German Athletics Federation, said in an email on Tuesday. \u201cStill, every athlete in the Olympic competitions should be motivated to demonstrate his or her best performance and aim for the best possible result. \u201d That approach, according to Kurschilgen, is what divides elite sport from   sport and what he thinks the Hahners failed to grasp. \u201cTheir main aim was to generate media attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what we criticize. \u201d The twins, who placed 81st and 82nd in the marathon, do not see it that way. Contacted on Monday, they initially declined to speak, but Anna Hahner later sent an email in which she said they had not planned on finishing    and had done their best individually. \u201cIn all the marathons we ran together before, there was a point in the race we had to split up,\u201d Anna said. \u201cThis was also the case in the Olympic marathon. \u201d Anna said she started faster, and then Lisa\u2019s group caught up with her at around the   mark, at which point Anna said they ran about three kilometers together. \u201cBut then I realized I couldn\u2019t run this pace, and I had to let them go,\u201d Anna said. \u201cLisa was always not far from me. After 40 kilometers, there was a turning point, and I knew, \u2018Okay Anna, two kilometers to go to close the gap to Lisa.\u2019 I invested all I had and 300 meters before the finish line, I was next to Lisa. It was a magical moment that we could finish this marathon together. We did not think about what we were doing. \u201d But Anna said the symbolism was not lost on either twin. \u201cWe trained the last four years to participate in this marathon,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither the time nor the position was what made us happy but to know that we did the best that was possible that day. \u201d And yet the sisters were well short of their best marathon performances. Anna\u2019s personal best in the marathon is 2 hours 26 minutes 44 seconds. Lisa\u2019s is 2:28. 39. In Rio, Anna finished in 2:45. 32, and Lisa in 2:45. 33 despite coming early to the Olympic city to acclimatize. Clearly, the large time gap between their previous performances and their Olympic performances made Kurschilgen and others only more convinced that they were not seeing the twins\u2019 best effort. There is a school of thought at the Olympics and elsewhere that it can be better for an athlete\u2019s profile and even their bottom line to lose memorably  \u2014   however unintentionally  \u2014   than to win routinely. D\u2019Agostino and Hamblin would not have become global talking points on Tuesday if they had simply collided and soldiered on without interacting. Nor would the British runner Derek Redmond have become part of an \u201cOlympic moment\u201d if he had simply won his 400 semifinal at the 1992 Olympics instead of tearing his hamstring and insisting on continuing the race. His father came onto the track to assist him as he hobbled to the finish with the Barcelona crowd cheering him on. Even though Redmond was disqualified for receiving outside aid, the image and the memory were and remain powerful. It is the unexpected and uncalculated gesture that so often moves the masses most, no matter what the culture. \u201cThis is Olympism,\u201d said Mary Wittenberg, former director of the New York City Marathon who has attended many Olympics. \u201cYes, athletes go as hard as they can to win the shiniest medals they can most of the time. We love that, and we want to see those medal dreams come true. That said, there are moments when it\u2019s not all about that and most often, as in the case of the Hahners, it\u2019s also because that\u2019s not in the cards at a given event. So an athlete makes a conscious decision to make the most of the moment in a different way. \u201d It is worth noting that the Hahners were not the only twins to finish side by side on Sunday. Kim   and Kim   of North Korea finished 10th and 11th on Sunday in an identical time of 2:28. 36. No word from North Korea whether this was perceived officially or unofficially as an uncompetitive act.'"}, "time": 1742563988.161131}
