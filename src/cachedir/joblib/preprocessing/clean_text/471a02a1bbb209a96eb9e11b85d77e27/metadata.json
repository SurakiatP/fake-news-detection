Border Patrol agents in the Tucson sector as penalties for their crimes stiffen. Realizing that being caught now means almost certain prosecution and incarceration, the smugglers and migrants are increasingly becoming violent with Border Patrol agents in remote border regions in efforts to escape and evade justice. [Border Patrol Agent Art Del Cueto, speaking to Breitbart Texas in his role as National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) spokesman, stated, \u201cThe smugglers are definitely becoming more violent with our agents. They now try to evade arrest and even use force to get away from us where during the Obama years they would joke with us and not mind being caught. They knew, back then, that they would get away with violating our laws. \u201d  Agent Del Cueto continued, \u201cWe are talking about significant force and violence being used against our agents. Very recently, one smuggler slammed a large rock into the side of an agent\u2019s head. \u201d The growing violent tendencies are not limited to the cartel\u2019s drug smugglers, according to Agent Del Cueto. \u201cEven the illegal aliens who aren\u2019t smuggling dope are growing more violent as they now face consequences for illegally entering. Before they would be let go the next day or so, now they face incarceration for illegally entering. They are willing to do anything possible to evade us. \u201d With the increased aggression levels on the part of the foreign nationals, the agents are forced to be on a higher alert level and willing to use higher level of force to defend their lives. Agent Del Cueto stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a concern because when we use force we are put under a microscope and everything we do is scrutinized by different investigative bodies. There was a culture of destroying the lives of Border Patrol agents during the past presidential administration and unfortunately, that culture hasn\u2019t yet completely dissipated. \u201d Though the Sinaloa Cartel or Federation controls the U. S.  border in this sector, the cartel is actually a collective of numerous regional criminal groups that simply operate under the banner of \u201cSinaloa Cartel. \u201d The Tucson sector is largely controlled by two of such regional groups, Los Memos and Los Salazar. The groups are engaged in frequent clashes with each other and Los Salazar has begun using armed scouts to enter U. S. territory, according to sources in Border Patrol who asked to remain anonymous. One source told Breitbart Texas, \u201cWe have them on video with   but we haven\u2019t caught them. They most likely wouldn\u2019t use them on random U. S. citizens, but have them for rip crews and to prevent Los Memos or U. S. gangs from stealing their drug loads. Be careful in the Huachuca Mountains right now. \u201d Brandon Darby is managing director and    of Breitbart Texas. He   the Cartel Chronicles project with Ildefonso Ortiz and Stephen K. Bannon.
