The Kurds have annexed a lot of territory they\u2019ve captured, and that could make the Mosul offensive something of a race. \\nIt also raises concerns about the Iraqi military\u2019s readiness for the offensive, as in the past they have not reacted well to military setbacks. The ISIS forces have been deploying a large number of car bombs to try to slow the offensive, and the addition of machine gun and sniper fire has ultimately stopped the advance.
