EMAILS HUMA ABEDIN SWORE UNDER OATH SHE GAVE UP \u2018ALL THE DEVICES\u2019 WITH STATE DEPT. EMAILS 0 SHARES [10/30/16] In a normal election year, a normal candidate\u2019s close aide who caused even minor embarrassment to a campaign so near to Election Day would be whisked away as quickly as possible to avoid becoming a distraction. \\nBut Huma Abedin is not simply a close aide, she\u2019s a critical member of Hillary Clinton\u2019s tiny inner circle that protects and \u2014 at times \u2014 enables the deeply flawed and secretive Democratic nominee. \\nSo despite FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement that the bureau is reviewing emails from Abedin\u2019s time at the State Department reportedly found on a laptop she shared with her soon-to-be ex-husband Anthony Weiner (confiscated as a part of the FBI\u2019s investigation into allegations he sexted with a 15-year-old North Carolina girl), the campaign made clear on Saturday that she\u2019s not going anywhere. \\nJohn Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, told reporters on a conference call that Abedin had been nothing but cooperative with investigators and sat for hours of depositions last summer as part of the civil lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch. \\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that she\u2019s done that we think calls into question anything that she\u2019s done with respect to this investigation\u2026 we fully stand behind her,\u201d Podesta said. \\nBut the new information that the FBI found State Department-related email on her home laptop also calls into question whether Abedin in fact turned over all of the devices she used to send and receive email while working at State. \\nOn June 28, 2016, Abedin said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work on them so the records could be given to the State Department. (These records were subsequently reviewed by the FBI.) \\n\u201cHow did you go about searching for what records you may have in your possession to be returned to the State Department?\u201d Attorney Ramona Cotca for Judicial Watch asked her. \\n\u201cI looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned \u2014 returned \u2014 gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents. And gave them devices and paper,\u201d Abedin answered. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742564621.8485773}
