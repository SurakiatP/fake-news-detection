This is in that tradition.\u201d \\nHe explained: \\nWhat\u2019s really happening here is simple. You\u2019ve got large financial institutions on Wall Street, you\u2019ve got banks like Bank of America, who have in some cases committed financial crimes. I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, \u2018You committed these offenses, you\u2019ve got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.\u2019 Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that. \\nNow, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you\u2019re supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers. \\nThe problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to left-wing groups. They do it under the guise of, \u201cWell, you know, if this bank discriminated against lenders racially, we\u2019re going to give this money to these left-wing quote-unquote housing groups to help deal with the problem.\u201d \\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on. These housing groups are advocacy groups. They\u2019re left-wing organizations. They are registering voters and getting voters out to the voting booth. And they specifically target what they call quote-unquote progressive voters. \\nSo this is taking the Department of Justice, which we\u2019ve experienced so much in recent years has been politicized by this Administration, even further to where now the Department of Justice is transferring money to left-wing groups \u2014 in an effort, frankly I think, to influence this election.'"}, "time": 1742561888.4447718}
