He was 87. Menachem Rosensaft, a longtime friend and the founding chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, confirmed the death in a phone call. Mr. Wiesel, a charismatic lecturer and humanities professor, was the author of several dozen books. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But he was defined not so much by the work he did as by the gaping void he filled. In the aftermath of the Germans\u2019 systematic massacre of Jews, no voice had emerged to drive home the enormity of what had happened and how it had changed mankind\u2019s conception of itself and of God. For almost two decades, the traumatized survivors  \u2014   and American Jews,   that they had not done more to rescue their brethren  \u2014   seemed frozen in silence. But by the sheer force of his personality and his gift for the haunting phrase, Mr. Wiesel, who had been liberated from Buchenwald as a    with the indelible tattoo   on his arm, gradually exhumed the Holocaust from the burial ground of the history books. It was this speaking out against forgetfulness and violence that the Nobel committee recognized when it awarded him the peace prize in 1986. \u201cWiesel is a messenger to mankind,\u201d the Nobel citation said. \u201cHis message is one of peace, atonement and human dignity. His belief that the forces fighting evil in the world can be victorious is a   belief. \u201d Mr. Wiesel first gained attention in 1960 with the English translation of \u201cNight,\u201d his autobiographical account of the horrors he witnessed in the camps as a teenage boy. He wrote of how he had been plagued by guilt for having survived while millions died, and tormented by doubts about a God who would allow such slaughter. \u201cNever shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed,\u201d Mr. Wiesel wrote. \u201cNever shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself. Never. \u201d Mr. Wiesel went on to write novels, books of essays and reportage, two plays and even two cantatas. While many of his books were nominally about topics like Soviet Jews or Hasidic masters, they all dealt with profound questions resonating out of the Holocaust: What is the sense of living in a universe that tolerates unimaginable cruelty? How could the world have been mute? How can one go on believing? Mr. Wiesel asked the questions in spare prose and without raising his voice he rarely offered answers. \u201cIf I survived, it must be for some reason,\u201d he told Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times in an interview in 1981. \u201cI must do something with my life. It is too serious to play games with anymore, because in my place, someone else could have been saved. And so I speak for that person. On the other hand, I know I cannot. \u201d There may have been better chroniclers who evoked the hellish minutiae of the German death machine. There were arguably more illuminating philosophers. But no single figure was able to combine Mr. Wiesel\u2019s moral urgency with his magnetism, which emanated from his deeply lined face and eyes as unrelievable melancholy. \u201cHe has the look of Lazarus about him,\u201d the Roman Catholic writer Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac wrote of Mr. Wiesel, a friend. President Obama, who visited the site of the Buchenwald concentration camp with Mr. Wiesel in 2009, called him a \u201cliving memorial. \u201d \u201cHe raised his voice, not just against   but against hatred, bigotry and intolerance in all its forms,\u201d the president said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cHe implored each of us, as nations and as human beings, to do the same, to see ourselves in each other and to make real that pledge of \u2018never again. \u2019\u201d Mr. Wiesel long grappled with what he called his \u201cdialectical conflict\u201d: the need to recount what he had seen and the futility of explaining an event that defied reason and imagination. In his Nobel speech, he said that what he had done with his life was to try \u201cto keep memory alive\u201d and \u201cto fight those who would forget. \u201d \u201cBecause if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices,\u201d he said. A year earlier, on April 19, 1985, Mr. Wiesel stirred deep emotions when, at a White House ceremony at which he accepted the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement, he tried to dissuade President Ronald Reagan from taking time from a planned trip to West Germany to visit a military cemetery there, in Bitburg, where members of Hitler\u2019s elite Waffen SS were buried. \u201cThat place, Mr. President, is not your place,\u201d he said. \u201cYour place is with victims of the SS. \u201d Mr. Reagan, amid much criticism, went ahead and laid a wreath at Bitburg. Paradoxically, the confrontation led to Mr. Wiesel\u2019s first postwar visit to Germany. He said afterward that he had been extremely moved by the young German students he met and the depth of their painful search for an understanding of their country\u2019s past. He urged reconciliation. \u201cHas Germany ever asked us to forgive?\u201d Mr. Wiesel asked. \u201cTo my knowledge, no such plea was ever made. With whom am I to speak about forgiveness, I, who don\u2019t believe in collective guilt? Who am I to believe in collective innocence?\u201d Mr. Wiesel had a leading role in the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, serving as chairman of the commission that united rival survivor groups to raise funds for a permanent structure. The museum became one of Washington\u2019s most powerful attractions. \u201cHe was a singular moral voice,\u201d said Sara J. Bloomfield, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cAnd he brought a kind of moral and intellectual leadership and eloquence, not only to the memory of the Holocaust, but to the lessons of the Holocaust, that was just incomparable. There is nothing that can replace the survivor voice  \u2014   that power, that authenticity. \u201d In his 1966 book, \u201cThe Jews of Silence: A Personal Report on Soviet Jewry,\u201d Mr. Wiesel called attention to Jews who were being persecuted for their religion and yet barred from emigrating. \u201cWhat torments me most is not the Jews of silence I met in Russia, but the silence of the Jews I live among today,\u201d he said. His efforts helped ease emigration restrictions. Mr. Wiesel condemned the massacres in Bosnia in the    \u2014   \u201cIf this is Auschwitz again, we must mobilize the whole world,\u201d he said  \u2014   and denounced others in Cambodia, Rwanda and the Darfur region of Sudan. He condemned the burnings of black churches in the United States and spoke out on behalf of the blacks of South Africa and the tortured political prisoners of Latin America. Yet the plight of Jews was foremost. In 2013, when the United States was in talks with Iran about limiting that country\u2019s nuclear weapons capability, Mr. Wiesel took out a   advertisement in The Times urging Mr. Obama to insist on a \u201ctotal dismantling of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure\u201d and its \u201crepudiation of genocidal intent against Israel. \u201d Central to Mr. Wiesel\u2019s work was reconciling the concept of a benevolent God with the evil of the Holocaust. \u201cUsually we say, \u2018God is right,\u2019 or \u2018God is just\u2019  \u2014   even during the Crusades we said that,\u201d he once observed. \u201cBut how can you say that now, with one million children dead?\u201d Still, he never abandoned faith indeed, he became more devout as the years passed, praying near his home or in Brooklyn\u2019s Hasidic synagogues. On the airplane that was to take him to an Israel darkened by the   war in 1973, he sat shoeless with a friend, and together they hummed Hasidic melodies. \u201cIf I have problems with God, why should I blame the Sabbath?\u201d he once said. Mr. Wiesel had his detractors. The literary critic Alfred Kazin wondered whether he had embellished some stories, and questions were raised about whether \u201cNight\u201d was a memoir or a novel, as it was sometimes classified on high school reading lists. Mr. Wiesel blazed a trail that produced libraries of Holocaust literature and countless film and television dramatizations. While some of this work was enduring, he denounced much of it as \u201ctrivialization. \u201d What gave him his moral authority in particular was that Mr. Wiesel, as a pious Torah student, had lived the hell of Auschwitz in his flesh. Eliezer Wiesel was born on Sept. 30, 1928, in the small city of Sighet, in the Carpathian Mountains near the Ukrainian border in what was then Romania. His father, Shlomo, was a   shopkeeper worldly enough to encourage his son to learn modern Hebrew and introduce him to the works of Freud. Later in life, Mr. Wiesel was able to describe his father in less saintly terms, as a preoccupied man he rarely saw until they were thrown together in Auschwitz. His mother, the former Sarah Feig, and his maternal grandfather, Dodye Feig, a Viznitz Hasid, filled his imagination with mystical tales of Hasidic masters. He grew up with his three sisters, Hilda, Batya and Tzipora, in a setting reminiscent of Sholom Aleichem\u2019s stories. \u201cYou went out on the street on Saturday and felt Shabbat in the air,\u201d he wrote of his community of 15, 000 Jews. But his idyllic childhood was shattered in the spring of 1944 when the Nazis marched into Hungary. With Allied troops fast approaching, many of Sighet\u2019s Jews convinced themselves that they might be spared. But the city\u2019s Jews were swiftly confined to two ghettos and then assembled for deportation. \u201cOne by one, they passed in front of me,\u201d he wrote in \u201cNight,\u201d \u201cteachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs. \u201d \u201cNight\u201d recounted a journey of several days spent in an airless cattle car before the narrator and his family arrived in a place they had never heard of: Auschwitz. Mr. Wiesel recalled how the smokestacks filled the air with the stench of burning flesh, how babies were burned in a pit, and how a monocled Dr. Josef Mengele decided, with a wave of a bandleader\u2019s baton, who would live and who would die. Mr. Wiesel watched his mother and his sister Tzipora walk off to the right, his mother protectively stroking Tzipora\u2019s hair. \u201cI did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever,\u201d he wrote. In Auschwitz and in a nearby labor camp called Buna, where he worked loading stones onto railway cars, Mr. Wiesel turned feral under the pressures of starvation, cold and daily atrocities. \u201cNight\u201d recounts how he became so obsessed with getting his plate of soup and crust of bread that he watched guards beat his father with an iron bar while he had \u201cnot flickered an eyelid\u201d to help. When Buna was evacuated as the Russians approached, its prisoners were forced to run for miles through high snow. Those who stumbled were crushed in the stampede. After the prisoners were taken by train to another camp, Buchenwald, Mr. Wiesel watched his father succumb to dysentery and starvation and shamefully confessed that he had wished to be relieved of the burden of sustaining him. When his father\u2019s body was taken away on Jan. 29, 1945, he could not weep. \u201cI had no more tears,\u201d he wrote. On April 11, after eating nothing for six days, Mr. Wiesel was among those liberated by the United States Third Army. Years later, he identified himself in a famous photograph among the skeletal men lying supine in a Buchenwald barracks. Only after the war did he learn that his two elder sisters had not perished. In the days after Buchenwald\u2019s liberation, he decided that he had survived to bear witness, but vowed that he would not speak or write of what he had seen for 10 years. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to use the wrong words,\u201d he once explained. He was placed on a train of 400 orphans that was diverted to France, and he was assigned to a home in Normandy under the care of a Jewish organization. There he mastered French by reading the classics, and in 1948 he enrolled in the Sorbonne. He supported himself as a tutor, a Hebrew teacher and a translator and began writing for the French newspaper L\u2019Arche. In 1948, L\u2019Arche sent him to Israel to report on that newly founded state. He became the Paris correspondent for the daily Yediot Ahronot as well, and in that role he interviewed Mr. Mauriac, who encouraged him to write about his war experiences. In 1956 he produced an   memoir in Yiddish. Pared to 127 pages and translated into French, it then appeared as \u201cLa Nuit. \u201d It took more than a year to find an American publisher, Hill  Wang, which offered him an advance of just $100. Though well reviewed, the book sold only 1, 046 copies in the first 18 months. \u201cThe Holocaust was not something people wanted to know about in those days,\u201d Mr. Wiesel told Time magazine in 1985. The mood shifted after Adolf Eichmann was captured in Argentina by Israel in 1960 and the wider world, in watching his televised trial in Jerusalem, began to grasp anew the enormity of the German crimes. Mr. Wiesel began speaking more widely, and as his popularity grew, he came to personify the Holocaust survivor. \u201cNight\u201d went on to sell more than 10 million copies, three million of them after Oprah Winfrey picked it for her book club in 2006 and traveled with Mr. Wiesel to Auschwitz. Mr. Wiesel wrote an average of a book a year, 60 books by his own count in 2015. Many were translated from French by his   wife, Marion Erster Rose, who survived the war hidden in Vichy, France. They married in Jerusalem in 1969, when Mr. Wiesel was 40, and they had one son, Shlomo Elisha. They survive him, as do a stepdaughter, Jennifer Rose, and two grandchildren. For Mr. Wiesel, fame did not erase the scars left by the Holocaust  \u2014   the nightmares, the perpetual insecurity, the inability to laugh deeply. \u201cI live in constant fear,\u201d he said in 1983. In 2007, a    man who called Mr. Wiesel\u2019s account of the Holocaust fictitious pulled him out of a hotel elevator in San Francisco and attacked him. (The man was convicted of assault.) From 1972 to 1976, Mr. Wiesel was a professor of Judaic studies at City College, where many of his students were children of survivors. In 1976 he was appointed the Andrew W. Mellon professor in the humanities at Boston University, and that job became his institutional anchor. In an effort to promote understanding between conflicting ethnic groups, Mr. Wiesel also started the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. Through a synagogue acquaintance of Mr. Wiesel\u2019s, it invested its endowment with the money manager Bernard L. Madoff, and his   Ponzi scheme, revealed in 2008, cost the foundation $15 million. Mr. Wiesel and his wife lost millions of dollars in personal savings as well. Mr. Wiesel lived long enough to achieve a particular satisfying redemption. In 2002, he dedicated a museum in his hometown, Sighet, in the very house from which he and his family had been deported to Auschwitz. With uncommon emotion, he told the young Romanians in the crowd, \u201cWhen you grow up, tell your children that you have seen a Jew in Sighet telling his story. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562906.4964223}
