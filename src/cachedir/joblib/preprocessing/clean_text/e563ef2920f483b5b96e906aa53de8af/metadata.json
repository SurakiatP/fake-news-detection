The second day of the Republican National Convention was shadowed by the first, thanks not only to the tough oratory, but also to Melania Trump\u2019s speech, which contained passages that were virtually identical to some in Michelle Obama\u2019s convention speech in 2008. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and senior Republicans offered conflicting explanations for similarities in the speeches. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, denying plagiarism, accused Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign of trying to draw attention to the issue. _____ 2. It\u2019s official. Delegates in Cleveland formally nominated Mr. Trump. Tonight\u2019s speakers, who are to focus on jobs and the economy, included two top Republicans who have kept Mr. Trump at a distance: the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Ben Carson Chris Christie, who was passed over as running mate, and two Trump children, Donald Jr. above, and Tiffany, also spoke tonight. Our live coverage is here. _____ 3. The Republicans\u2019 convention, and the Democrats\u2019 next week, is drawing out two familiar satirists: Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert\u2019s unctuous commentator \u201cStephen Colbert. \u201d \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d with Mr. Colbert as host and Mr. Stewart as executive producer, plans live broadcasts after each night of both conventions. So far, the idea has been good for ratings. Monday night\u2019s program was the No. 1 broadcast   show for the first time in five months. _____ 4. Hillary Clinton is weighing a shortlist of possible running mates that includes Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Our   experts have created an elections model that puts Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chances of winning at 76 percent and Mr. Trump\u2019s at 24 percent. _____ 5. Roger Ailes, the subject of a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment, is in talks with 21st Century Fox on his departure as chairman of Fox News, according a person briefed on the discussions. A consulting role at Fox News appeared a possibility. His exit or demotion would be a stunning fall. Mr. Ailes, pictured above as he started Fox News 20 years ago, turned it into a   cable news program and the leading media platform for conservatives. _____ 6. NASA scientists were so stunned by global temperatures that they pushed up their annual announcement by months. Every month so far this year has hit a global heat record. _____ 7. Wildlife experts have an idea on how to reduce the Northeast\u2019s booming population of   deer, which pose an increasing hazard to drivers. Bring back the cougar, they argue in a new paper. The eastern cougar could prey on enough deer in its historic range to prevent 155 human deaths and 21, 400 human injuries, and save $2. 3 billion, over the course of 30 years. But it seems unlikely that people would accept the cost: an estimated one human death a year from wild cougars. _____ 8. Lawsuits filed by three states say Volkswagen\u2019s emission deception went all the way to the top. The suits say the company\u2019s current chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, was aware 10 years ago, when he headed VW\u2019s luxury division, that Audis were not being outfitted with equipment needed to meet U. S.   standards. \u201cThe idea that this level of fraud could take place and involve so many people at such high levels of a major international corporation is appalling,\u201d said Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general. _____ 9. The nation\u2019s racial tensions are playing out in the entertainment world. Leslie Jones, a star of the   \u201cGhostbusters\u201d reboot, left Twitter after trolls pelted her with slurs, threats and pornography. \u201cI mean on my worst day I can\u2019t think of this type of hate to put out,\u201d she posted in disbelief. Twitter said that it was trying to rein in abusers, but acknowledged that it was not \u201cwhere it should be on how we handle these issues. \u201d _____ 10. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for another attack in Europe: a    Afghan immigrant who used an ax on four passengers on a Bavarian train, got out and then seriously injured a woman who was walking her dog. The random nature of ISIS attacks grew more clear, as a regional Islamic group in Nice, France, said that more than a third of 84 people killed by a rampaging truck were Muslims. _____ 11. Finally, good news and bad news. The bad: A huge construction crane collapsed on the Tappan Zee Bridge, north of New York City, shutting down traffic on major highways. The good: No one was killed. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that the boom fell across six lanes of traffic, cars that are doing 60 to 70 miles an hour, and not one car was hit by the boom,\u201d said an official with the crane operators\u2019 union. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
