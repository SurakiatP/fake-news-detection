You step up into leadership, in helping those who are afraid, angry, or in need of healing \u2013 and this includes helping yourself. \\nYour inner child is both strong and sensitive this week, meaning that you may feel extra-imaginative, extra-emotional, and experience the magical healing energy that comes from pure childlike faith. \\nWith the full moon, do get extra rest if possible. Be aware that some people may experience insomnia and be grouchy as a result. Take care of yourself accordingly. \\nFrom the Magical Unicorns Oracle Cards at: http://bit.ly/UnicornsCards \\nSF Source Doreen Virtue  '"}, "time": 1742562439.7961318}
