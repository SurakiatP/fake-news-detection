The Dortmund police chief, Gregor Lange, said at a   news conference that \u201cwe assume it was a targeted attack\u201d on the Borussia Dortmund team. The wounded player, Marc Bartra of Spain, was undergoing surgery on his right wrist, a spokesman for the team said.   Watzke, Borussia Dortmund\u2019s chief executive, said that \u201cthree explosive devices\u201d had detonated near a hotel outside Dortmund where the players were staying. The state prosecutor told reporters that a letter claiming responsibility had been discovered near the site of the blasts, but that it was too soon to say if it was genuine. The prosecutor, Sandra L\u00fccke, declined to answer further questions about the letter\u2019s contents, including what language it was written in. The authorities also would not describe the three explosive devices. Mr. Lange said that a fourth \u201csuspicious object\u201d had also been found at the scene, but that it had not been set to go off. Photographs of the bus showed that the rear window had been shattered, and the tires appeared to have been blown out. In an interview with Blick, a Swiss newspaper, the goalkeeper Roman B\u00fcrki described the moments after what he said was a \u201chuge bang\u201d as the bus turned onto the main road to go to the stadium. \u201cI was sitting in the very back row next to Marc Bartra, who was hit by fragments of the broken rear window,\u201d said Mr. B\u00fcrki, who is Swiss. All the players then ducked and lay on the bus floor, he said, because \u201cwe didn\u2019t know if something more would happen. \u201d He added: \u201cThe police were there quickly and sealed everything off. We are all shocked  \u2014   in those minutes, no one was thinking about football. \u201d On Twitter, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain wished a \u201cspeedy recovery\u201d for Mr. Bartra, 26, who played with Barcelona for seven seasons before joining Dortmund last year. The match, against Monaco, will be played on Wednesday night, the first leg of a quarterfinal in the UEFA Champions League. In a Twitter post, the Dortmund police told fans: \u201cWe are preparing for a big deployment and will take care of security\u201d at the match on Wednesday. Anxiety over terrorism instigated or inspired by the Islamic State and other extremist groups operating in Europe has risen steadily over the past few years after bloody assaults in France, Belgium, Britain and, most recently, Sweden. In Germany on Dec. 19, a truck crashed into a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people. Soccer has also figured in Germany\u2019s recent brushes with terrorism. The country\u2019s national team was playing France in Paris in November 2015 when the deadliest terrorist attacks in the French capital opened with a suicide bomber blowing himself up outside the stadium. Days later, the German authorities postponed the national team\u2019s next international match, in Hanover against the Netherlands, after receiving what security officials termed credible threats of an attack. In that episode, thousands of fans had already reached the stadium when the   postponement was announced. Precise details about the tip or any evidence have not emerged. On Tuesday at the Westfalenstadion, the stadium where the match was to be played, hundreds of Monaco fans, hearing the news, chanted \u201cDortmund! Dortmund!\u201d in a show of solidarity. In what has become another signal of support when terrorist assaults disrupt people\u2019s plans, Dortmund fans quickly adopted a hashtag offering Monaco fans places to stay. Chancellor Angela Merkel, an avowed soccer fan, often attends important international matches. Her chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, condemned the attack on Twitter. \u201cA despicable, cowardly deed, whoever did it,\u201d he wrote. He thanked the police, fans and players for staying calm and doing their duty. Borussia Dortmund is one of Germany\u2019s most successful teams, dating to the late 19th century when soccer first came to Germany from England. Dortmund, in the heavily populated Ruhr industrial region, is the site of a national museum dedicated to the sport that opened less than two years ago. The match to be played on Wednesday will demand extra effort from the shocked players, Mr. Watzke said. \u201cThe question is, can we forget the scenes of today?\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742628538.7310746}
