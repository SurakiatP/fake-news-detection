The majority of them are women and children,\" Bozan said. \"The militants were holding them in Mosul, Hawija and Tall Afar in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria. The Yazidis who were saved were residents of Sinjar. We brought them home to their relatives and close ones. Some of them, in accordance with their wishes, were taken to refugee camps,\" Bozan said. \\nOn the second anniversary of the Sinjar attack on August 3, the UN reported that more than 3,200 women and children are still held by the terror group and being subjected to almost-unimaginable violence. \\nBozan said that many of them are being held in Mosul, approximately 120 km east of Sinjar.

In particular, hundreds of Yazidi prisoners are being held in Mosul.
