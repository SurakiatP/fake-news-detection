Trump lashed out on Tuesday in the aftermath of a disappointing first debate with Hillary Clinton, scolding the moderator, criticizing a beauty pageant winner for her physique and raising the prospect of an   attack on Bill Clinton\u2019s marital infidelities in the final stretch of the campaign. Having worked assiduously in recent weeks to cultivate a more disciplined demeanor on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump cast aside that approach on Tuesday morning. As Mrs. Clinton embarked on an ebullient campaign swing through North Carolina, aiming to press her newfound advantage, Mr. Trump vented his grievances in full public view. Sounding weary and impatient as he called into a Fox News program, Mr. Trump criticized Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor, for asking \u201cunfair questions\u201d during the debate Monday evening, and speculated that someone might have tampered with his microphone. Mr. Trump repeated his charge that Mrs. Clinton lacked the \u201cstamina\u201d to be president, a claim critics have described as sexist, and suggested that in the future he might raise Mr. Clinton\u2019s past indiscretions. Defying conventions of political civility, Mr. Trump leveled cutting criticism at a beauty pageant winner, Alicia Machado, whom Mrs. Clinton held up in Monday night\u2019s debate as an example of Mr. Trump\u2019s disrespect for women. Mr. Trump said on Fox he was right to disparage the former Miss Universe because of her weight. \u201cShe was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who was the pageant\u2019s executive producer at the time. Mrs. Clinton has already been broadcasting an ad highlighting crude remarks from Mr. Trump about women she answered his taunts about her marriage with a rhetorical shrug, telling reporters Mr. Trump was free to run whatever kind of campaign he preferred. On board her campaign plane, she plainly relished her moment of apparent triumph, and poked fun at Mr. Trump\u2019s morning lamentations. \u201cAnybody who complains about the microphone,\u201d she said, \u201cis not having a good night. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s setback in the debate represents a critical test in the final six weeks of the race. Having drawn closer to Mrs. Clinton in the polls, Mr. Trump now faces an intensified clash over his personal temperament and his attitudes toward women and minorities  \u2014   areas of grave concern for many voters that were at the center of the candidates\u2019 confrontation on Monday. Against Mr. Trump\u2019s brooding, Mrs. Clinton cut a strikingly different profile on the campaign trail on Tuesday, emerging emboldened from her encounter with the Republican nominee. At a rally in Raleigh, N. C. Mrs. Clinton, brandishing her opponent\u2019s debate stumbles, assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments suggesting he avoided paying taxes and welcomed the 2008 financial crisis as a buying opportunity. \u201cWhat kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes?\u201d Mrs. Clinton asked the crowd. \u201cOne who should never be president, is the answer to that question. \u201d Having shaken at least temporarily the malaise of the past month, Mrs. Clinton must seek to gain a durable upper hand over Mr. Trump, who before the debate had been delivering a more focused message on trade, immigration and national security. Mr. Trump\u2019s comportment on Tuesday threatened to undermine his gains of the past month, and recalled his practice during the Republican primaries and much of the general election of belittling political bystanders in language that alienated voters, like attacking the Muslim parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq and a Hispanic federal judge. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will approach the remainder of the race with the unfiltered abandon of his comments Tuesday morning. By the day\u2019s end, Mr. Trump had returned to a caustic but somewhat more conventional script, attacking Mrs. Clinton in bitter language at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. Blasting Mrs. Clinton as a \u201cvessel for her friends, the donors,\u201d Mr. Trump exhorted the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get rid of that crooked woman. \u201d And Mr. Trump again complained at the event about how he had been treated by Mr. Holt, whom he referred to as \u201cthe M. C. \u201d The fear among Republicans is that Mr. Trump will confront adversity by continuing to swing impulsively at politically inopportune targets, dragging the party again into needless and damaging feuds, as he did for most of the summer. The notion of raising Mr. Clinton\u2019s infidelity is particularly controversial among Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, who have sent conflicting signals about that line of attack. Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said in a CNN interview that he deserved credit for holding back from that particular subject, saying Mr. Trump had been \u201cpolite and a gentleman. \u201d But Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and a close confidant of Mr. Trump\u2019s, called for a far harsher approach. Mr. Trump, he told a reporter for the website Elite Daily, had been \u201ctoo reserved\u201d in his confrontation with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Giuliani recommended attacking Mrs. Clinton for having questioned Monica Lewinsky\u2019s credibility in claiming an affair with Mr. Clinton. He also called Mrs. Clinton \u201ctoo stupid to be president. \u201d Mr. Giuliani has his own complex marital history: He is on his third marriage as mayor, he surprised his second wife by announcing his plans to separate from her at a news conference. Should Mr. Trump follow the path prescribed by Mr. Giuliani, it could transform the final six weeks of his candidacy into an onslaught of unrestricted personal vituperation  \u2014   a risky course that would probably please Mr. Trump\u2019s political base at the cost of his broader appeal. But Democrats signaled on Tuesday that they would welcome an extended battle with Mr. Trump over matters of temperament and personal character. Priorities USA Action, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton, released a television ad highlighting a debate exchange in which Mr. Trump said his temperament was his \u201cstrongest asset,\u201d along with clips of Mr. Trump using obscene and violent language. And Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said in a television interview that Mr. Trump had appeared \u201cflustered\u201d and \u201cran out of gas. \u201d During a campaign stop in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Kaine suggested that Mr. Trump was too unsteady for the White House. \u201cIf you\u2019re that rattled in a debate,\u201d he said, \u201ctry being president. \u201d Still, among Mr. Trump\u2019s core voters, there is clearly an appetite for blunter and more personal attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and at his rally in Florida, several said they hoped Mr. Trump would be harsher in the next debate. \u201cI\u2019m glad he was a gentleman,\u201d said Fran Hadjilogiou, 75, of Indian Harbour Beach. \u201cHe should just go get her next time. \u201d Jim Clapper, 66, of Palm Bay, said he hoped Mr. Trump would bring up Mr. Clinton\u2019s infidelity \u201cevery chance he gets. \u201d \u201cHe ought to bring it up every day so that the young people in this country know what went on with that family,\u201d Mr. Clapper said.'"}, "time": 1742564064.4427474}
