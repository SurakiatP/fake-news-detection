And the switch created the desired headlines one day before the election that concerned voters could safely choose Hillary: she won\u2019t be dragged from the Oval Office to be tried as a criminal! \\nThe Sacramento Bee had a nicely artistic presentation: \\nThe liberal press all headlined with the same not-so-subliminal message \u2014 Vote Democrat: \\nFBI SAYS REVIEW CLEARS CLINTON IN EMAIL INQUIRY \u2014 New York Times \\nFBI won\u2019t pursue charges against Clinton \u2014 Washington Post \\nFBI Affirms No Clinton Charges \u2014Wall Street Journal \\nFBI clears Clinton but Anger Persists \u2014 Los Angeles Times \\nClinton cleared in late twist \u2014 Chicago Tribune \\nFBI clears Clinton in email case \u2014 Houston Chronicle \\nAgain, no FBI e-mail charge \u2014 Denver Post \\nSo five out of eight newspapers (chosen by me as being typical major publications) used the verb \u201cclear\u201d which is broad and has the air of finality. \\nHowever, the truth is more complex than a brief headline can convey: Hillary may get a temporary reprieve on the email case now, but that doesn\u2019t mean she is off the hook. As Congressman Trey Gowdy (a former prosecutor) remarked on Sunday, \u201cInvestigations are never over unless a statute of limitations has expired or unless jeopardy has attached.\u201d \\nSo if something more incriminating turns up, it\u2019s game on. \\nPlus, the Clinton Foundation remains an object of FBI investigation and is rumored to be a stronger case. In fact, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer appeared on a Fox Business show Monday and remarked, \u201cThe way it\u2019s been explained to me by people in the FBI sphere is that basically they\u2019re going to get one bite at this apple, so if you bring an email case prosecution, or were to do that and were to fail, the Clinton Foundation investigation just politically would be too much.\u201d \\nCertainly the Wikileaks story that Chelsea\u2019s deluxe wedding was financed by the Foundation has refocused attention on family\u2019s corrupt slush fund disguised as a do-gooder organization. \\nSo Hillary in prison orange remains a possibility, albeit an unlikely one.'"}, "time": 1742564425.649331}
