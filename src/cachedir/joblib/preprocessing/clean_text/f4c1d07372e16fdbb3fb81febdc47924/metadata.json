You may be dismissive of the very idea that the backlash to the national anthem protests, sparked by the 49ers\u2019 Colin Kaepernick, has played a role in the NFL\u2019s TV ratings, which have dropped by about 12 percent year-over-year. To continue to dismiss that is to blatantly ignore legitimate data on the subject. \\nA fresh poll from Seton Hall surveyed 841 adults across the U.S. Each respondent was asked to identify seven separate factors as a reason for the NFL ratings drop, allowing them to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for each of them. The leading factor, according to the poll, was the national anthem protests, which scored \u201cyes\u201d at a rate of 56 percent. \\nOther answers also scored \u201cyes\u201d at a high rate, including 50 percent of \u201cyeses\u201d for coverage of the presidential election, 47 percent for the league\u2019s handling of domestic violence cases, 44 percent for the over-saturation of the market, 39 percent for increased interest in postseason baseball, and 33 percent for controversy over head injuries and player safety. \\nInterestingly enough, the lowest score, tied with player safety at 33 percent, was \u201ca decline in quality of play on the field.\u201d Many would cite this as the overriding factor to all of this, and it certainly is factoring in.
