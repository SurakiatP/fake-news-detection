[Wonder performed his hit songs \u201cIsn\u2019t She Lovely\u201d and My Cherie Amour,\u201d changing the lyrics to the latter song to include \u201cMy Michelle Amour\u201d while the First Lady looked on.   Earlier during the show, Obama helped Fallon write out   notes, including to her husband: \u201cThank you Barack, for proving you\u2019re not a lame duck, but my very own silver fox. \u201d And Fallon wrote a   note of his own: \u201cThank you, First Lady Michelle Obama, for bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase, \u2018the right to bear arms. \u2019\u201d Fallon also playfully suggested that the First Lady run for president herself in 2020.  Obama and Fallon were joined on Wednesday night\u2019s show by comedians Dave Chappelle and Jerry Seinfeld. Watch the clips above.
