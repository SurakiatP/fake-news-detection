Over the past week, Mondane and Williams have taken photographs of students with quotations from Pence that the two seniors feel are \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic. \u201d  \u201cFor me personally, [Pence] represents the larger Trump administration,\u201d Senior Immane Mondane told The Observer, the   newspaper of the University of Notre Dame and the nearby St. Mary\u2019s College.  \u201cHis administration represents something, and for many people on our campus, it makes them feel unsafe to have someone who openly is offensive but also demeaning of their humanity and of their life and of their identity. \u201d \u201cI know that during his time as governor of Indiana and also during his campaign trail, along with Trump, he has made offensive statements towards minority groups that affect me, like women and \u201d Williams claimed. Williams argues that the selection of Pence as the university\u2019s commencement speaker contradicts with the school\u2019s Catholic mission. \u201cI feel that is offensive to such a large population here at Notre Dame, and I also believe it goes against certain Catholic Social Teaching, which is something the University likes to broadcast that it stands behind, but it picks and chooses when it wants to stand behind them,\u201d Williams complained. Encouragingly, Mondane has organized a discussion on her concerns and has invited students of all political persuasions to attend and voice their opinions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a   discussion in the weeks to come,\u201d Mondane said. \u201cEveryone is welcome to the discussion, and we\u2019re going to have an event and advertise, but we really want to get the voices there who may not agree with us and who may take issue with what we\u2019re doing. We both have an equal platform, and we\u2019re on an equal playing field where one narrative isn\u2019t totally dominant of the other. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
