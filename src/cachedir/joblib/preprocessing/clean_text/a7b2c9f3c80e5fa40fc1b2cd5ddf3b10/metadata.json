[Obamacare 2. 0 would inflict severe healthcare costs on Rust Belt voters while easing taxes on counties that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, according to Bloomberg News. Trump swept into the White House on a populist wave because voters protested mass immigration policies, erosive trade deals, and   Middle Eastern military conflicts \u2014  not because they wanted another \u201ccrazy corporatist agenda,\u201d Coulter tweeted.  Could some investigative reporter write a piece explaining why Ryan is so hellbent on this deeply unpopular healthcare bill?  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  We did the tough thing!  We passed an unpopular bill!  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  GOP: When did you get the sense that Americans are clamoring for a tax cut to help the \u201cjob creators\u201d?  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  Only 50% of people even pay taxes!  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  \u201dJob creators\u201d aren\u2019t popular right now.  They\u2019re creating jobs in Indonesia and jobs for lobbyists.  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  TRUMP DIDN\u2019T RUN ON CUTTING TAXES!  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  NO ONE SAID CUTTING TAXES WAS TOP PRIORITY!  Even businesses would prefer cutting regulations, red tape and trial lawyers.  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  The only thing that got the GOP this win that voters thought Trump was going to abandon this crazy corporatist agenda.  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  GOP response to Trump\u2019s victory has been to   on all the ugly unpopular policies that make GOP hated.  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  GOP has to get working class votes, or they\u2019re just handing it to social justice warriors.  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  I\u2019d love to pay less in taxes.  THAT ISN\u2019T THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. Bigger: No jobs, no health care, no wall, immigrant crime  welfare  \u2026      \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017,  Conservatives are furious over the bill\u2019s complete lack of enforcement against illegal aliens receiving healthcare tax credits \u2014  meant for citizens and certain immigrants \u2014  through document fraud and identity theft. Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash said the bill has \u201cno constituency\u201d beyond the political class entrenched in Washington, D. C. and their wealthy insurance company allies.'"}, "time": 1742561661.5553741}
