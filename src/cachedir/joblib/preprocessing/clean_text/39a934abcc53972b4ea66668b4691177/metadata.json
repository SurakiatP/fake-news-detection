Sawmill worker Tom Logan felt left behind by mainstream politics and finds Lady Gaga annoying, so voted for a billionaire whose main interests are money, \u2018pussy\u2019 and himself. Logan said: \u201cTrump\u2019s going to create well-paid blue collar jobs that are full of dignity and pleasingly masculine. I can\u2019t wait to be a hunky steel worker taking home $150,000 a year. \u201cI know Donald won\u2019t let me down, because why would someone lie about something that\u2019s going to help them become the most powerful person in the world?\u201d However economist Donna Sheridan said: \u201cDespite Tom\u2019s optimism, Trump\u2019s main business experience is getting idiots to do pointless tasks on a bullshit reality TV show. \u201cTherefore his economic plan is likely to be talking about jobs, realising it\u2019s complicated, losing interest and then cutting welfare for all the people who still haven\u2019t got jobs. \u201cMeanwhile his extreme stupidity will tank the economy, so in a few years Tom\u2019s main job will be catching squirrels and cooking them on sticks in a ditch. \u201cOther job opportunities in the new America will include tooth puller, rat meat chef and crossbow-wielding encampment defender.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564048.4858532}
