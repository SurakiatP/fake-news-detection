Friday during his joint press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, President Donald Trump was asked if tapes existed of his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey.  Trump said he would address that \u201cmaybe sometime in the near future. \u201d Trump said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you something about that maybe sometime in the very near future. In the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction. He\u2019s a leaker. But we want to get back to running our great country, jobs, trade deficits. We want them to disappear fast. North Korea, big problem. The Middle East, a big problem. \u201d \u201cSo, that\u2019s what I am focused on. That\u2019s what I have been focused on. But yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction. We are doing very well. It\u2019s almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know. You have to run up the whole East Coast and win everything as a Republican, and that\u2019s what we did. So it was just an excuse. But we were very, very happy and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said and some of the things that he said just weren\u2019t true. Thank you very much.
