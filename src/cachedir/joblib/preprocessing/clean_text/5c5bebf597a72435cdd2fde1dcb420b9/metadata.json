A jury in southeast Georgia, where the case was tried because of intense pretrial publicity here, returned guilty verdicts against the man, Justin Ross Harris, 35, on eight counts, including malice murder and cruelty to children. Mr. Harris, who sometimes glanced downward as the verdict was read in Brunswick, could be sentenced to life in prison for the death of his    son, Cooper. The verdict, announced on the jury\u2019s fourth day of deliberations, ended the suspense of a trial that began on Oct. 3, and it capped nearly 29 months of sordid allegations and scrambled loyalties. The cause of Cooper\u2019s death was undisputed  \u2014   Mr. Harris left him in a Hyundai Tucson while he worked as a software engineer at Home Depot on June 18, 2014  \u2014   but it fell to jurors to decide whether he had been malicious or merely  . The manner of Cooper\u2019s death is a heartbreakingly familiar one: At least 39 children in the United States have died of \u201cvehicular heatstroke\u201d this year, according to statistics compiled by a San Jose State University researcher. But the case against Mr. Harris was striking because of the severity of the charges and the state\u2019s argument that he was eager to end his responsibilities to his family. \u201cThis killer\u2019s heart abandoned this child long before he died,\u201d Charles P. Boring, an assistant district attorney, said during his closing argument. \u201cThis defendant\u2019s heart abandoned this child when he left him to die a terrible death in that car. \u201d In a statement after the verdict, the district attorney\u2019s office noted a message that Mr. Harris sent minutes before he left his vehicle, Cooper still in his car seat: \u201cI love my son and all, but we both need escapes. \u201d But near the end of a trial in which Mr. Harris was vilified as a   man with a compromised marriage, one of his lawyers, H. Maddox Kilgore, argued that moral failings did not make a motive for murder. \u201cThere is no evidence of any kind of hatred or bad feelings or anger,\u201d Mr. Kilgore said. \u201cWhatever term you want to come up with, any term you come up with, there\u2019s no evidence that Ross expressed that toward his son. \u201d In the end, Mr. Harris was convicted on all eight counts for which he was indicted. Three of the charges were not connected to Cooper\u2019s death and instead focused on Mr. Harris\u2019s electronic communications with at least one underage girl. He will be sentenced next month. Although Mr. Harris\u2019s former wife, Leanna Taylor, filed for divorce after Cooper\u2019s death, she testified in her husband\u2019s defense. Ms. Taylor\u2019s lawyer, Lawrence J. Zimmerman, said she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the verdict.'"}, "time": 1742561703.5315742}
