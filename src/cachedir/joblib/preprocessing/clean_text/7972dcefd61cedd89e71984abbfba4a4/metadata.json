None of us ever wants to confront the reality that one of our kids is sick, but that\u2019s just what singer Michael Bubl\u00e9 and his wife, Luisana, are facing. \\nTheir eldest son, Noah, was just diagnosed with cancer. He\u2019s just three years old. \\nThe family were dealt the tragic blow after the youngster visited doctors with a suspected case of mumps , Argentinian website La Nacion reports . \\n\u201cThey\u2019re staying positive and Noah is a fighter.\u201d \\nArgentinian journalist Tomas Dente read out a text message from Daniela on a morning TV show which said: \u201cTo tell you the truth I\u2019m devastated. This is very recent. \\n\u201cThe only thing I ask is that you don\u2019t speculate because not everyone has children and can understand what this means. \\nA story on Buzzfeed shares the couple\u2019s statement, in which the singer asks for privacy as he and his family fight this battle. \\nAccording to BuzzFeed , the Argentinian newspaper La Nacion reported that Noah was initially taken to the doctor for a suspected case of the mumps and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer, every parent\u2019s worst nightmare. \\nAs Bubl\u00e9 said in his post, \u201cWe are devastated about the recent cancer diagnosis of our oldest son Noah who is currently undergoing treatment in the US. We have always been very vocal about the importance of family and the love we have for our children.\u201d A photo posted by Michael Bubl\u00e9 (@michaelbuble) on Oct 16, 2016 at 7:25am PDT \\nIt seems clear that this isn\u2019t a family that will take this situation lying down. Noah\u2019s cancer is in for a fight. \\nThe battle won\u2019t be easy, especially since childhood cancer research is woefully underfunded. The St Baldrick\u2019s Foundation states that only 4% of cancer research is devoted to childhood cancer, despite the fact that, according to Dr. Eugenie Kleinerman, head of the division of pediatrics at the Children\u2019s Cancer Hospital at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, \u201cCuring childhood cancer is the equivalent of curing breast cancer in terms of productive life years saved.\u201d \\nBubl\u00e9 and his wife are putting their careers on hold to tend to their son, and expressing hope that, with the \u201csupport of family, friends and fans around the world, we will win this battle, God willing.\u201d \\nRecently, the singer had expressed his joy at being a dad, telling Entertainment Tonight , \u201cThe only regret that I have in my life is that I took this long to have kids, because I had no idea the perspective it would give me. I had no idea how much I would love being a dad.\u201d \\nAnd now he has to face that hardest battle any parent could imagine. Hopefully, that love will be enough, and his son will pull through.
