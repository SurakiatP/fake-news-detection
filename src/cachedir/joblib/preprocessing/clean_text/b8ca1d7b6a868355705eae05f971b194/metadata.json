He hits a number of nails on the head. \\nA few at random: \\n[ At 1m08s ] The truth is, no matter how crazy this election seems it is less crazy than the condition of our country. \\nThiel checks off some of the craziness: the national debt, healthcare costs, student loans, income stagnation, \u2026 \\nAnd wars : \\n[ At 2m52s ] While households struggle to keep up with the challenges of everyday life, the government is wasting trillions of dollars of taxpayer money on faraway wars. \\nRight now we\u2019re fighting five of them: in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia. \\nWhich is the more enthusiastically pro-war party? The Democrats! \\n[ At 7m55s ] Yet even after these bipartisan failures, the Democratic Party today is more hawkish than at any time since it began the war in Vietnam. \\nWhat\u2019s the root problem? Optimism ! \\n[ At 8m55s ] For a long time our elites have been in the habit of denying difficult realities. \\nWhy is Trump the solution? \\n[ At 10m54s ] Nobody would suggest that Donald Trump is a humble man; but the big things he\u2019s right about amount to a much-needed dose of humility in our politics. \\nVery unusually for a presidential candidate, he has questioned the core concept of American exceptionalism. He doesn\u2019t think that the force of optimism alone can change realities without hard work. \\nJust as much as it\u2019s about making America great, Trump\u2019s agenda is about making America a normal country. \\nThe only nail whose head Thiel leaves un -hit is immigration. This is a bit odd, as there is probably no other single issue that accounts for so much of Trump\u2019s popular support. \\nIt\u2019s somewhat less odd to those of us who recall Thiel taking up an interest in the immigration issue some years ago, then quickly dropping it as, apparently, too radioactive. \\nWe at VDARE.com are bolder; which is one reason \u2014 although, so be sure, a very minor one \u2014 why we have much, much less money than he does. \\nIt is none the less heartening to see a successful entrepreneur speaking so clearly and eloquently in support of Trump.
