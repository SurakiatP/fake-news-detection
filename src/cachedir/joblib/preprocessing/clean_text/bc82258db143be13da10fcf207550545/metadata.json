{"duration": 0.6152939796447754, "input_args": {"text": "'The anxiety began well before the Cleveland convention, where the candidate of the \u201cForgotten Men,\u201d the one who declared Americans \u201cthe greatest Race on the face of this old Earth,\u201d seemed likely to clinch his party\u2019s presidential nomination. Doremus Jessup, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis\u2019s 1935 novel \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here,\u201d sees something dark and terrible brewing in American politics  \u2014   the potential for \u201ca real fascist dictatorship\u201d led by the    populist candidate Berzelius Windrip. Friends scoff at this extravagant concern. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t happen here in America, not possibly!\u201d they assure him. But Jessup, a   Vermont newspaper editor and a \u201cmild, rather indolent and somewhat sentimental liberal,\u201d worries about the devastation ahead. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he agonizes night after night. \u201cOh  \u2014   write another editorial    I suppose!\u201d When Election Day comes to pass, Jessup learns that his editorials have not done the trick. The reality of the new situation feels unspeakably awful, \u201clike the   passing of a friend. \u201d Jessup faces the presidential inauguration in a state of high distress, convinced that the nation is careering toward its doom, but that nobody  \u2014   least of all his fellow liberals  \u2014   can do much to stop it. \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d is a work of dystopian fantasy, one man\u2019s effort in the 1930s to imagine what it might look like if fascism came to America. At the time, the obvious specter was Adolf Hitler, whose rise to power in Germany provoked fears that men like the Louisiana senator Huey Long or the radio priest Charles Coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the United States. Today, Lewis\u2019s novel is making a comeback as an analogy for the Age of Trump. Within a week of the 2016 election, the book was reportedly sold out on Amazon. com. At a moment when instability seems to be the only constant in American politics, \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d offers an alluring (if terrifying) certainty: It can happen here, and what comes next will be even ghastlier than you expect. Yet the graphic horrors of Lewis\u2019s vision also limit the book\u2019s usefulness as a guide to our own political moment. In 1935, Lewis was trying to prevent the unthinkable: the election of a   candidate to the presidency of the United States. Today\u2019s readers, by contrast, are playing   scrambling to think through the implications of an electoral fait accompli. If Lewis\u2019s postelection vision is what awaits us, there will be little cause for hope, or even civic engagement, in the months ahead. The only viable options will be to get out of the country  \u2014   or to join an armed underground resistance. Lewis\u2019s second wife, the journalist Dorothy Thompson, provided much of the inspiration for \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here. \u201d In 1931, she interviewed Hitler, scoffing at his \u201cstartling insignificance\u201d when encountered   . Back in the United States, Thompson interviewed Huey Long, who had vowed to challenge Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency in 1936. She noted that Long\u2019s populist message and swaggering style reminded her of Hitler, and according to Lewis\u2019s biographer, Richard Lingeman, Lewis took the message to heart. A recent Nobel Prize winner, known for his superhuman productivity, Lewis churned out the entire manuscript of \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d between May and August of 1935. The novel arrived in bookstores that October. By that point, some of the immediate threat had passed. (On Sept. 8, 1935, Long was assassinated at the Louisiana State Capitol, one of the great political traumas of the 1930s.) Lewis\u2019s book nonetheless sold 320, 000 copies, becoming his most popular work to date. Reviewers agreed that the book\u2019s success had little to do with its literary merits though \u201ca vigorous   tract,\u201d one critic noted, it was \u201cnot much of a novel. \u201d What propelled its popularity was a sense of urgency, the worry that the United States  \u2014   like the nations of Western Europe  \u2014   might contain dark forces yet to be unleashed. A slightly different sense of urgency seems to be fueling the book\u2019s latest surge in popularity. We have already experienced some of what Lewis describes in the first third of the book: a blustery populist candidate rising, against all odds, to the presidency of the United States. Now the great question is whether or not we are moving into Lewis\u2019s terrifying future. The novel\u2019s Everyman candidate, Berzelius (Buzz) Windrip, is hardly a perfect   for Trump. A creature of the Great Depression and a Democrat, Windrip sweeps into office as a   promising $3, 000 to $5, 000 for every \u201creal American family. \u201d His movement style evokes the   of Nazi Germany rather than the anonymous jabs of the Twitter mob. Still, there are enough points of resonance to cause palpitations in the heart of any anxious   liberal. Like Trump, Windrip sells himself as the champion of \u201cForgotten Men,\u201d determined to bring dignity and prosperity back to America\u2019s white working class. Windrip loves big, passionate rallies and rails against the \u201clies\u201d of the mainstream press. His supporters embrace this message, lashing out against the \u201chighbrow intellectuality\u201d of editors and professors and policy elites. With Windrip\u2019s encouragement, they also take out their frustrations on blacks and Jews. The architect of Windrip\u2019s campaign is a savvy newsman named Lee Sarason, the novel\u2019s closest approximation of Steve Bannon. It is Sarason, not Windrip, who actually writes \u201cZero Hour,\u201d the candidate\u2019s popular jeremiad on national decline. Sarason believes in propaganda, not information, openly arguing that \u201cit is not fair to ordinary folks  \u2014   it just confuses them  \u2014   to try to make them swallow all the true facts that would be suitable to a higher class of people. \u201d This is where the novel comes to rest by Inauguration Day: Through a combination of deception and charisma, the feared Windrip ascends to the presidency while the nation\u2019s liberals tremble. It is only after the inauguration, though, that \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d takes a truly dark turn. Upon moving into the White House, Windrip immediately declares Congress an \u201cadvisory\u201d body, stripped of all real power. When members of Congress resist, he locks them up without the slightest semblance of due process, the beginning of the end for American democracy. The rest of the book describes one long, disorienting nightmare, a national descent into labor camps and torture chambers and martial law. The novel gains its energy from Jessup\u2019s internal struggle, his regret at having done so little to stop it all while he still could. \u201cThe tyranny of this dictatorship isn\u2019t primarily the fault of Big Business, nor of the demagogues who do their dirty work,\u201d he realizes. \u201cIt\u2019s the fault of Doremus Jessup! Of all the conscientious, respectable,   Doremus Jessups, who have let the demagogues wriggle in, without fierce enough protest. \u201d With this heavy hand, Lewis seeks not only to satirize American liberals, but to induce them to pay attention before it\u2019s too late. While the book skewers Jessup\u2019s passivity, however, it does little to suggest viable modes of engagement under the Windrip regime, short of abandoning home and family and fleeing to Canada. Every time Jessup attempts some modest act of resistance, he is met with the ruthless repression of the state. When Jessup prints a righteous editorial, Windrip\u2019s goons arrest him and murder his   . Jessup ends up as a   in a concentration camp, beaten down but determined to carry on. Six months into his sentence, he escapes and joins the underground movement percolating in Canada  \u2014   where, the book implies, he should have gone in the first place. The one bright spot for the   forces is that things don\u2019t work out particularly well for anyone else. Windrip never follows through on his pledge to restore prosperity and redistribute wealth, fueling conflict with his early supporters, who mostly end up dead or in jail. Even Windrip himself gets little of what he wants. As president, he insists on absolute obedience, \u201clouder, more convincing Yeses from everybody about him. \u201d After two years of this treatment, his crafty aide Sarason maneuvers the president into exile, only to be deposed himself a month later in a military coup. By the book\u2019s closing pages, Jessup has returned to the United States as a disciplined resistance fighter, organizing armed rebellions throughout the Midwest. His transformation illustrates Lewis\u2019s most powerful message: When it happens here, everyone should be prepared to resist. But Jessup\u2019s story also underscores how difficult it can be to sort out what to do at moments of swift political change and social confusion. In our brave imaginations, we undoubtedly do the right thing when fascism comes to America. In reality, we might not recognize it while it\u2019s happening.'"}, "time": 1742628478.008976}
