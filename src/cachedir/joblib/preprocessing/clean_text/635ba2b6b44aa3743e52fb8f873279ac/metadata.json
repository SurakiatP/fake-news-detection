Trump came to this historic battlefield town Saturday to offer his vision for America\u2019s future, saying he hoped to \u201cheal the divisions\u201d of the country as President Lincoln tried to do here seven score and 13 years ago. Yet in his own Gettysburg address, Mr. Trump, who has been sliding in the polls less than three weeks before Election Day, did not offer much in the way of   oratory and did not seem to embrace Lincoln\u2019s unifying ambition. Instead, the Republican nominee used the first third of what had been promoted as a \u201cclosing argument\u201d speech to nurse personal grievances, grumbling about \u201cthe rigging of this election\u201d and \u201cthe dishonest mainstream media,\u201d and threatening to sue the women who have come forward  \u2014   an 11th woman did on Saturday  \u2014   to accuse him of aggressive sexual advances. \u201cEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign  \u2014   total fabrication,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over. \u201d And the more substantive part of the speech, intended to outline his first 100 days in office if he were elected president, did not quite live up to its billing by campaign aides, who had promised a major policy address not unlike Newt Gingrich\u2019s 1994 \u201cContract with America. \u201d Instead, a subdued Mr. Trump  \u2014   who on Friday acknowledged the possibility of electoral defeat  \u2014   largely repeated his existing campaign promises, from renegotiating trade deals to enforcing tougher immigration laws. Mr. Trump\u2019s carefully scripted presentation on Saturday was meant to project a new level of forethought and seriousness from a man not usually associated with either. His proposals had legislative titles like the \u201cAffordable Child Care and Elder Care Act\u201d and the \u201cRepeal and Replace Obamacare Act. \u201d The speech, before a small, handpicked crowd, was also a recognition that Mr. Trump needs to establish himself as someone with the discipline and temperament to lead the nation. \u201cHillary Clinton is not running against me, she\u2019s running against change,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s running against all of the American people and all of the American voters. \u201d Mr. Trump did offer specific immigration proposals, including an \u201cEnd Illegal Immigration Act\u201d that would establish mandatory minimum prison sentences for undocumented immigrants caught illegally   the country after deportation. He also said he would stop issuing visas to any country that refused to take in citizens ordered deported from the United States, a policy that would almost certainly disrupt immigration and commerce with China, which is one such country. Mr. Trump also reiterated his promise to build a border wall with Mexico and have Mexico pay for it, though he hedged a bit, saying, \u201cthe country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall. \u201d (At a rally in Cleveland later on Saturday, his most energetic of the day, Mr. Trump was back to leading his crowd in chants calling for Mexico to pay for the wall.) Repeating earlier pledges to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington, Mr. Trump promised to push through a series of new ethics laws, as well as term limits for both the House and Senate. And he called for \u201ca hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal work force through attrition, exempting military, public safety and public health. \u201d Mr. Trump has a long history of threatening and occasionally following through on litigation, and in raising the possibility of suing his female accusers, he may have simply been trying to stop more from coming forward. At a news conference on Saturday in Los Angeles, Jessica Drake, an adult film actress, claimed that, after meeting Mr. Trump at a 2006 charity golf event in Lake Tahoe, Nev. she had accepted an invitation to meet in his hotel room. Not wanting to go alone, Ms. Drake said she was accompanied by a couple of female friends. Ms. Drake, who appeared Saturday with the women\u2019s rights lawyer Gloria Allred, said Mr. Trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission. After returning to her room, Ms. Drake said, Mr. Trump or a man phoning on his behalf offered her $10, 000 to return to his room, which she declined. In a statement, the Trump campaign called the accusation \u201canother example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election. \u201d \u201cMr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her,\u201d it said. Aboard her campaign plane, Mrs. Clinton said: \u201cI saw where our opponent, Donald Trump, went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said if he\u2019s president he\u2019ll spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior. \u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country deserves from the next president and vice president, and when it comes right down to it, I think that\u2019s what people are going to vote on. \u201d At her rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton devoted much of her remarks to the state\u2019s contentious Senate race, giving an extended plug to the Democratic candidate, Katie McGinty, and attacking the Republican incumbent, Senator Patrick J. Toomey, for not denouncing Mr. Trump for his vulgar remarks about women captured in a recording. A Bloomberg News poll conducted this month after the release of the tape showed Mrs. Clinton with a nine percentage point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania. On Saturday, she tried to offer an olive branch to the white   voters there who have gravitated to Mr. Trump. \u201cYou probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump,\u201d she told the crowd of 1, 800 gathered in a high school gymnasium. \u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to tell them: Tell them that I understand they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too. \u201d After his appearance in Gettysburg, Mr. Trump reverted to his trusted stump speech in    rallies in Virginia Beach and Cleveland, exciting large crowds by attacking Mrs. Clinton and promising to bring back jobs. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look back at this rally and you\u2019re going to remember it for the rest of your life because this will be the beginning,\u201d he said in Virginia. \u201cYou\u2019re going to remember Nov. 8 because your country is going to be a country that starts winning again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563538.139933}
