She fares even better among white voters who didn\u2019t vote in 2012 than she does among white voters who did. It\u2019s a pattern that has been true across all of the Upshot/Siena surveys in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. \\nThere has not been an influx of new voters who might help Mr. Trump. According to our estimates, Mrs. Clinton has a 16-point lead among newly registered voters. \\nThe idea that Trump was bringing millions of new voters to the Republican Party was always a myth. \\nDonald Trump got the most votes of any candidate in a Republican presidential primary. Trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a Republican primary. Trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his party\u2019s primary ballots cast against him. \\nHillary Clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters, and without a doubt, some of those voters have been motivated by Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. \\nTrump was right. He has brought millions of new voters to the polls. What he neglected to tell Republicans is that they are coming for Hillary Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742561926.3399246}
