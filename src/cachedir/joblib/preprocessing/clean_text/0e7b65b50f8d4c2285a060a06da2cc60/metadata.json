One banner appeared to read \u201cResist, Organized, Act Up!\u201d \\nDrivers were clashing with the protesters in an effort to get the bridge open, according to witnesses. Police quickly detained the small group and traffic began moving again about 15 minutes. \\nThe Port Authority said 10 people who were blocking the eastbound lanes were arrested. No injuries were reported. The agency said it is investigating.'"}, "time": 1742562404.2416558}
