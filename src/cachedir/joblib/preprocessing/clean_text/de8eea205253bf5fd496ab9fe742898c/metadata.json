Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday, but a large number of religious leaders will take part in the ceremony, reading Scripture and offering prayers for his administration. Six religious leaders  \u2014   including a rabbi, a cardinal, and a diverse group of Protestant preachers  \u2014   will participate, more than for any previous president, said Jim Bendat, an author and historian of inaugural ceremonies. Each will have 60 to 90 seconds to offer a reading or lead a prayer. \u201cSome inaugurations have had just one, others have had two or three covering different religions, but this is a record,\u201d Mr. Bendat said. Here are those who are scheduled to participate: Cardinal Dolan has been the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York since 2009. His participation in the inauguration has been controversial in part because he has criticized Mr. Trump. In a 2015   piece for The Daily News, he described the   as the   manifestation of \u201cthe ugly phenomenon called nativism\u201d that shaped American politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries. He said voters should \u201ctake seriously the Bible\u2019s teaching that we are to welcome the stranger. \u201d Last week on his radio show, the cardinal said he was \u201chonored\u201d to be invited to take part in the inauguration and said he would have done the same thing had Hillary Clinton won the election. \u201cIt\u2019s not the person, it\u2019s the office, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI pray with prisoners. That doesn\u2019t mean I approve of what they\u2019ve done. \u201d Mr. Rodriguez is the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, an organization that says it represents roughly 100 million Hispanic evangelicals in the United States and Latin America. In a statement, he said that he saw participating in the inauguration as \u201cnot just a patriotic honor\u201d but \u201cas a sacred duty. \u201d Mr. Rodriguez has walked a tightrope in the past, defending Mr. Trump against accusations of racism (he called them \u201chyperbole from the liberal media\u201d) but also speaking up for undocumented immigrants, many of whom attend evangelical churches. \u201cThe vast majority are not rapists or murderers,\u201d he said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. \u201cThey\u2019re actually   Christians, committed to biblical orthodoxy or very staunch conservative Catholics. How about that? So they\u2019re not rapists or murderers and we have to find a way of finding a solution. If we\u2019re not going to deport them, how are we going to integrate them?\u201d Pastor White is a Florida televangelist who is controversial in evangelical circles for her promotion of prosperity gospel, which states that true believers will be blessed not just with eternal salvation but also with health and wealth on Earth. She is also the pastor of a church in Apopka, Fla. Prosperity gospel is a theological world that has seen some abuse from the misuse of financial donations given to speed the arrival of God\u2019s blessings. The   practices of Ms. White and other televangelists were investigated by the Senate Finance Committee in 2007, but no wrongdoing was found. On her website, Pastor White sells a range of spiritual   products like books and DVDs and also exhorts followers to make a \u201cfirst fruits\u201d donation to her ministry, a gift she says is \u201dmandated by God. \u201d \u201cYour sacrificial offering will be a seed for blessings for the remainder of the year,\u201d Pastor White wrote. \u201cAccording to Ezekiel 44, when you present your First Fruits offering, it will cause a blessing to rest upon your house!\u201d Rabbi Hier is the founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization named after the   Nazi hunter and Holocaust survivor. Critics have called for him to drop out of the inauguration, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s support among white nationalist groups, but the rabbi said participating in the ceremony was a \u201c \u201d for him. \u201cThere are 364 days a year for politics, for the two sides to pile on each other. Three hundred   days of that is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce every four years, the president of United States deserves a pass from both sides from political bickering otherwise, we weaken our democracy. \u201d Rabbi Hier will be the first Jewish religious leader to take part in an inaugural ceremony since 1985, he said, a fact that weighed in his decision to attend. \u201cIf a rabbi turned this down and said no?\u201d he said, \u201cIt would be a tremendous backlash. Many people would say \u2018look at how ungrateful the Jewish community is. \u2019\u201d Mr. Graham is the son of Billy Graham, a pioneering televangelist and longtime spiritual adviser to American presidents from both parties. He has continued much of his father\u2019s work. He is president and chief executive of Samaritan\u2019s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and has been a vocal Trump supporter. The day after the election, Mr. Graham wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump had won because \u201cGod\u2019s hand intervened Tuesday night to stop the godless, atheistic progressive agenda from taking control of our country. \u201d He continued: Bishop Jackson runs Great Faith Ministries International and Impact Television Network, which describes itself as the only Christian network founded and operated by  . Bishop Jackson hosted Mr. Trump at his Detroit church and interviewed him on his network last September, a decision which drew criticism from other   spiritual leaders because of the  \u2019s comments about minorities. In the interview, the bishop asked Mr. Trump how he planned to heal the country\u2019s racial divide if he won the presidency. Mr. Trump attributed that polarization to a lack of \u201cspirit\u201d and   poverty and promised to create jobs. Bishop Jackson defended his visit with Mr. Trump to The Detroit Free Press in August. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being a Judas to my people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an endorsement. This is engagement, for him to tell us what he wants to do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562163.6089404}
