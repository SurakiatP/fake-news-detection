[Marlow professed his admiration for Nomani\u2019s recent column, \u201cThe  \u2019s Cyber Jihad Against Trump and His Supporters,\u201d which covered what Marlow described as \u201cthe most significant news event of the year so far, aside from the Trump inauguration\u201d: the    riots at U. C. Berkeley.  \u201cBeing a journalist, I believe in the power of words, and I also study propaganda. I feel like we\u2019re in the middle of a fierce propaganda war,\u201d Nomani said. \u201cThe one word that I think is important for everyone to know is \u2018agitprop.\u2019 It\u2019s an old word for agitation propaganda. As you know, working at Breitbart, the concept of \u2018 \u2019 is thrown at you all the time. It\u2019s being used today as a way to try to immediately discredit folks. I thought to myself, \u2018Well, what do we have happening on the Left? \u2019\u201d  \u201cI write in the piece about how I\u2019ve been a lifelong liberal,\u201d she explained. \u201cJust to let your listeners know, I came from India at the age of four and grew up in Morgantown, West Virginia, in a college town and absorbed all the strong liberal politics, really absorbed it into my heart. So I\u2019ve been really distressed these last months. Another confession I had written a while ago in the Washington Post was that I had voted for Donald Trump, as a lifelong liberal. \u201d Nomani recalled the impact of seeing Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart News under assault by   at a speech in Chicago and then again at U. C. Berkeley.  \u201cI watched this happening on my TV screen, and I thought to myself, just like we do with anything in journalism, \u2018Where did it begin? \u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had the good fortune to have met this really great   named Eric Feinberg, who works out of New York City, and basically what we noticed was the hashtag that was being used to bring people to the streets there in Berkeley was hashtag #ShutDownMilo. And so what Eric did was track it, track the hashtag back to months before the actual protest happened against Milo, to a kind of odd website called ItsGoingDown. org. \u201d As chronicled in her latest essay, Nomani worked from that website to trace the outlines of a \u201c  radical movement that is causing mayhem in our streets today. \u201d \u201cI call it a cyber jihad because, as a Muslim, I\u2019ve been well familiar with the agitation propaganda by my Muslim extremists,\u201d she explained. \u201cI see how what\u2019s happening here is this very dangerous intersection  \u2014   \u2018intersection politics\u2019 is such a popular word  \u2014   between the far Left in America and the far Right in my Muslim community. That\u2019s why I now see this as a cyber jihad that\u2019s now trying to really claim America. \u201d Marlow noted the grim irony that the new \u201cAntifa\u201d ( ) movement is \u201cjust about the most fascist force in the West,\u201d and he argued this intersection of totalitarian ugliness and   politics is more widespread than the \u201c \u201d fringe Nomani describes in her work. \u201cI hear you, and you won\u2019t get a fight from me on this one because, honestly the disturbing reality for me as a liberal is exactly this dynamic you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Nomani replied. \u201cI use this concept of \u2018 \u2019 really as a   to the use of  . It\u2019s a linguistic tool on my part as a writer. But intellectually, absolutely what you\u2019re saying has been my experience and my observation in my reporting. \u201d  Marlow asked Nomani about the most controversial action taken to date by the president for whom she voted: his executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven   countries. \u201cI do call it a \u2018  Muslim ban,\u2019 as I also called the women\u2019s march a \u2018  women\u2019s march,\u2019\u201d Nomani said. \u201cThey are all examples of \u2018hashtag intifada,\u2019 as I also talk about  \u2014   an attempt to try to exaggerate reality, to make it agitprop. I as a Muslim and a member of the Muslim Reform Movement recognize the extremism problem that we have in the world and want us as a country to develop pragmatic solutions. \u201d \u201cThe \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 did not work because of this framing that was done, this propaganda that was done against the executive order,\u201d she said, stressing that she uses the term \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 for Trump\u2019s executive order sarcastically.  \u201cWhat I also ultimately think we have to do is, in your community and in America, really walk the middle path with solutions,\u201d she urged, warning that extreme expressions from the far Right would lead to the same sort of angry but ineffectual dead end as the  . \u201cEverything that has to happen in our country going forward, I think, has to be done with sensibility but also a sense of compassion to each other as human beings. I hope that does not sound too far liberal to you, but I think you know what I mean, in terms of trying to draw people at their heart also,\u201d she said. Nomani said it broke her heart to declare that America has become embroiled in a civil war, but she added, \u201cThere is an insurgency that\u2019s trying to claim America from the far Left. \u201d \u201cWe have to have a balanced and rational response from all circles. And that\u2019s what I just want to continue to appeal to people to be, is civil and human, remembering the humanity of each other  \u2014   because where we see that lost from the far Left, we cannot replace it with inhumanity,\u201d she said.
