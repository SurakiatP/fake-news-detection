When the comedian Maz Jobrani was asked to deliver the 2017 commencement address at U. C. Berkeley, he immediately said yes. Later, it sank in  \u2014   this is a big deal. Past speakers have included scholars, innovators and statesmen. \u201cAnd then it becomes daunting,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you go, \u2018Oh my God I\u2019ve got to write something and it\u2019s going to go on the internet and the whole world\u2019s going to see it. \u201d Mr. Jobrani himself graduated from Berkeley in 1993, then started a doctoral program in political science at U. C. L. A. before walking away for comedy. In a news release, a student leader suggested the appearance by Mr. Jobrani, who fled Iran as a child with his family in 1978, would resonate in a time of discord over immigration and Islam. We caught up with Mr. Jobrani by phone in Los Angeles, where he lives. Some excerpts: Q. Have you been thinking about what you\u2019ll say? A. Oh my God, Mike, I\u2019m losing sleep over it. I\u2019m serious. I wake up at, like, 5 in the morning with ideas and I jot them on my iPhone. One of the challenges for me is, being a comedian, they expect me to be funny too. If you watch one of my favorite [commencement addresses] with Conan O\u2019Brien at Dartmouth  \u2014   so brilliantly written and so funny for 15 minutes or so. He\u2019s just killing it. And then he goes into his story of being ousted by Jay Leno and so then it becomes poignant. And I\u2019m just watching and I\u2019m going, \u2018Oh, my God. How did he do that?\u2019 Q. You\u2019ve become more political on stage. What worries you right now? A. Trump doesn\u2019t go a day without worrying me. It seems like everyday there\u2019s something new. And then as a comedian I\u2019ve been also saying, \u2018It\u2019s hard to keep up with the guy,\u2019 because he just does something outrageous every day. Q. Tell me about your experience at Berkeley. A. It was four of the best years of my life. I really loved it. I remember being taught to think critically at Berkeley. But there was also interesting stuff. We had a guy back then called the Naked Guy, who was just this guy who was a nudist who was a student who would go to class with like a little sheet around his midsection and that was it. You used to see him walking around and sometimes he\u2019d just have it hanging out, and it was like, \u2018Well, this is Berkeley.\u2019 Q. If you could go back and talk to Maz in 1993, what advice would you give? A. Follow your heart. Do what you love. Because I was constantly struggling with that. If it\u2019s in your heart go for it. Don\u2019t listen to other people. Q. Any smaller advice? A. Be kind. It feels good.

In an editorial, the newspaper said its work on the tragedy has just begun. Some of most stunning imagery of our bountiful spring has been from the Carrizo Plain. Situated east of San Luis Obispo, the   long grassland has been lit up by   wildflowers. Among the blooms are baby blue eyes, orange poppies, purple bush lupine and goldfields  \u2014   all set against rare green canvas. Matthew O\u2019Brien, a Bay Area reader, shared a photo he took in late March facing the normally dry Soda Lake and the Temblor Range, which forms the eastern border of the Carrizo Plain. The area is vast, open, and usually desolate. But word of the   superbloom has been drawing thousands of   visitors, said Gabe Garcia, a field manager at the Bureau of Land Management. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of a     type of event,\u201d Mr. Garcia said. The show won\u2019t go on forever. Mr. Garcia predicted the flowers would start to wither within a few weeks as the weather turns warmer and drier. \u201cOnce that happens, everything kind of goes back to the way it was,\u201d he said. Here are a few more pictures by Bob Wick, a Bureau of Land Management photographer. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.
