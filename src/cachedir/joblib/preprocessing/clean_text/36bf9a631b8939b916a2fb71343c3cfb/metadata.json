What would you say to a voter who right now will be seeing you and hearing what you\u2019re saying, saying I didn\u2019t trust her before. I don\u2019t trust her anymore right now. And they\u2019re heading to the ballot box tomorrow. \\nHILLARY CLINTON: You know, I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the e-mails. I think that\u2019s factored in to what people think and now they are choosing a president. So I would urge everybody to get out and vote early in all the states that have early voting because I think Americans want a president who can lead our country and get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top and who can bring our country together. I offer that I can do that. And I\u2019m very confident that the American people know that and we\u2019re going to continue to discuss what\u2019s at stake in this election because I believe that it\u2019s one of the most consequential elections ever. \\nCourtesy of Information Liberation Don't forget to follow the D.C.
