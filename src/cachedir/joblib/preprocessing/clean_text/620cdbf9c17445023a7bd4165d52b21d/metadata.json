Chuck Schumer ( ) used his first speech as Senate Minority Leader to attack   Donald Trump\u2019s use of Twitter  \u2014   repeating a theme that Democrats and the media used often during the 2016 presidential campaign, to no real effect. [Schumer\u2019s speech, which was hailed by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer for its toughness, laid out an opposition agenda that included holding Trump accountable for promises to change Washington. And Schumer warned Trump that Twitter would not suffice:  So, Mr. President, the issues facing this country are many. We have a lot of work to do  \u2014   creating jobs, raising incomes, making college and health care affordable, rebuilding our infrastructure, making trade laws work for the American worker, keeping Americans safe from threats of violence and terrorism, taking care of our vets. Now, each one takes serious thought and action. These issues are too important for mere words, our challenges too entrenched for mere tweeting. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency. We have real challenges and we have real needs to get things done. Many Americans are afraid, Mr.   that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you, Twitter suffices. There\u2019s nothing wrong with using Twitter to speak to the American people. It\u2019s a good use of modern media. But these issues are complex and demand both careful consideration and action. We cannot tweet them away. Later, Schumer added: \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t conduct foreign policy by Tweet. \u201d However, the Obama administration frequently has used Twitter to conduct foreign policy. For example, under Obama, the  State Department used a Twitter account, \u201cThink Again Turn Away,\u201d to counter propaganda from the   Islamic State. The Obama administration also used Twitter hashtag campaigns, such as \u201c#UnitedforUkraine\u201d and \u201c#BringBackOurGirls,\u201d to confront various foreign policy crises.

In a further irony, Schumer Tweeted to promote his speech.   \u2026    he tweeted. https:  .   \u2014   Joel B.
