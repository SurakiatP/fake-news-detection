Trump\u2019s chief adviser used the first day of the Republican National Convention on Monday to excoriate Gov. John R. Kasich for not endorsing Mr. Trump, touching off a remarkably bitter exchange between the campaign of the presumptive Republican nominee and advisers to Ohio\u2019s popular Republican governor. Addressing reporters at a breakfast on Monday, Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s de facto campaign manager, accused Mr. Kasich of acting \u201cpetulant\u201d for refusing to support Mr. Trump following the governor\u2019s defeat in the Republicans\u2019 presidential nominating process. \u201cHe\u2019s embarrassing his party in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Manafort said of Mr. Kasich, calling the governor\u2019s chief political strategist the culprit behind Mr. Kasich\u2019s strategy of not endorsing Mr. Trump. \u201cNegotiations broke down because John Weaver thinks that John Kasich will have a better chance to be president by not supporting Donald Trump. \u201d Such a calculation, Mr. Manafort said, is \u201ca dumb, dumb, dumb thing. \u201d Asked about the criticism, Mr. Weaver escalated the dispute. He not only mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s rambling and   awkward introduction of Mike Pence as his running mate on Saturday, but also pointedly brought up Mr. Manafort\u2019s history of working with contentious foreign leaders. \u201cManafort\u2019s problem, after all those years on the lam with thugs and autocrats, is that he can\u2019t recognize principle and integrity,\u201d Mr. Weaver wrote in an email. \u201cI do congratulate him though on a great pivot at the start of the convention after such a successful   launch. He has brought great professionalism, direct from Kiev, to Trump world. \u201d The    was the latest extraordinary turn in a campaign that has veered sharply away from political precedent. Mr. Manafort\u2019s blistering attack was the latest reminder that, when it comes to their critics, Mr. Trump and his high command care little for political niceties  \u2014   in this case the traditional imperative to unify the party as the convention gets underway. And the reprisal from Mr. Weaver highlighted the lingering divisions in the party, even as Republicans gather at Quicken Loans Arena to coronate Mr. Trump: Mr. Kasich is part of a group of elected Republican officials who still will not support the party\u2019s unconventional  . But Mr. Kasich, who will not appear onstage this week, is not just another Republican skeptic of Mr. Trump: he is also the   governor of the hotly contested swing state where the convention is taking place and where the election may be decided in November. Recognizing this, Mr. Manafort used his remarks at the Bloomberg   breakfast to assail Mr. Kasich, while also driving a wedge between the governor and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. Mr. Portman is locked in a competitive   fight that could help decide which party controls the Senate next year. Mr. Portman endorsed Mr. Kasich in the presidential primary, and the governor has been aggressively campaigning for the senator in his   campaign this year. But the two have historically not been close and have been seen as representing two distinct Republican political families in Ohio. \u201cHe\u2019s very upset with John Kasich,\u201d Mr. Manafort said of Mr. Portman. \u201cBecause John Kasich is hurting him. \u201d Asked about this remark, Mr. Portman\u2019s campaign manager emphatically denied the senator is angry with Mr. Kasich for not backing Mr. Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s totally false,\u201d said Corry Bliss, Mr. Portman\u2019s top aide. \u201cRob Portman and John Kasich are working hand in hand to defeat Ted Strickland and any suggestion otherwise is inaccurate. \u201d Mr. Manafort went even further to link Mr. Trump to Mr. Portman, though. The Trump aide said, \u201cWe are working very closely with Rob Portman\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re running our campaigns together. \u201d Mr. Portman, wary of Mr. Trump\u2019s negative image among Ohio\u2019s critical suburban voters, has been careful to distinguish himself from the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. He is also not speaking at the convention and instead is appearing at a series of events intended to soften his image. Mr. Manafort\u2019s assault, which he repeated in interviews on network morning TV programs, infuriated Ohio\u2019s Republican leadership. Matt Borges, the Ohio Republican chairman, called the criticism of Mr. Kasich \u201cobviously calculated\u201d and expressed irritation that Mr. Trump was reigniting his feud with the governor in one of the swing states where the presumptive Republican is most competitive in the polls. \u201cIt\u2019s inaccurate, it\u2019s not wise and, while they may think it\u2019s good for their campaign, they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Mr. Borges said by phone, adding that he expected Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to \u201cfix it. \u201d As for whether Mr. Kasich is positioning himself for another White House bid by not endorsing Mr. Trump, a spokesman for the governor, Chris Schrimpf, said, \u201cKasich can\u2019t endorse someone who divides our country and that\u2019s not a political decision for him. \u201d But Mr. Kasich over the weekend wrote an opinion piece attacking Hillary Clinton in The Union Leader, New Hampshire\u2019s largest newspaper, and is using the convention week to meet with the delegation from the country\u2019s first primary state, as well as a series of other party officials and donors who could aid him should he run again for president.'"}, "time": 1742564045.2139978}
