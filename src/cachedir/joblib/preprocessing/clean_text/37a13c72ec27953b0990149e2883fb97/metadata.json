The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there\\'s empty space here.\" Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube \\nHe just couldn\\'t stop talking about it, adding that if they were covering a Trump rally, the room would be \u201cpacked.\u201d \\nThough Shapiro took a dig at the Democratic nominee for her apparently \u201cempty\u201d rally, those who were in attendance still sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to her.
