Trump has vowed to turn blue states red in November, but as he continues to rattle Republicans with his combative style and provocative proposals, voters in some of the country\u2019s most conservative strongholds are considering a radical idea: supporting Hillary Clinton. The dilemma posed by this year\u2019s choice of candidates is perhaps most apparent here in Utah, a mountain state that has not backed a Democrat for president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. More than 50 years later, a large Mormon population with a strong distaste for Mr. Trump has left the state up for grabs, and with a substantial Mormon presence spilling into places such as Arizona, Idaho and Nevada, what would normally be a Republican safe zone could be surprisingly competitive. With the Clinton campaign looking to put   states in play, the decision for many Mormon voters in Utah has become agonizing as they digest Mr. Trump\u2019s stances toward Muslims in light of their own history as an   religion, and as his \u201cAmerica First\u201d message repels   Mormons who travel the world on missions and who welcome refugees. \u201cPeople who normally vote Republican are in a terrible state of ambivalence right now,\u201d said Tim Chambless, a political scientist at the University of Utah. \u201cThey are so undecided. They want to vote, but they aren\u2019t sure how to vote. \u201d The first signs of Mr. Trump\u2019s troubles in Utah date to early March, when Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and a Mormon who is beloved in the state, gave a speech here warning that Americans were being duped by Mr. Trump. Later that month, Mr. Trump was throttled by Senator Ted Cruz in the state\u2019s caucuses, winning a paltry 14 percent of the vote. In June, two polls showed Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton deadlocked in Utah, making it increasingly plausible that its six electoral votes are really in play. With three months until the election, the Clinton campaign is now considering a possible upset in Utah, the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is aggressively wooing disenchanted Republicans, and on Monday word came that Evan McMullin, a Mormon who is a former C. I. A. official opposed to Mr. Trump, was entering the race. Voters such as Angie Melton, who has never voted for a Democrat, are feeling deeply torn. \u201cI\u2019m upset by this turn of events,\u201d Ms. Melton, 41, said as she sat in the shade with her family next to the towering Salt Lake Temple, the center of Mormonism. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Republican, but my thought has been that she would be less damaging in terms of world politics,\u201d she said, referring to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that I agree with much of anything she says or her as a person,\u201d Ms. Melton added, \u201cbut I would rather that she win. \u201d Such   is common as trepidations about Mr. Trump grow. On substance and style, he evokes an antipathy among many Mormons that is rooted in culture, religion and history. For a religious group that was driven to Utah during the 19th century in the face of persecution, Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for religious tests and a ban on Muslim migration echo a painful past, leaving some wondering if they will be next. \u201cThe issue of religious liberty is an important one in the state, and the notion of a religious test for immigration raises deep concerns,\u201d said Chris Karpowitz, a director of Brigham Young University\u2019s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. \u201cMormons are sensitive to issues like this because of their own history. \u201d Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints in upstate New York in 1830. Converts, however, were often targeted as heretics for practicing polygamy, believing in scriptures exclusive to Mormonism and saying that their faith was the true restoration of Christianity. Most Mormons were Democrats in the 19th century, Professor Karpowitz notes, because of Republican opposition to polygamy, but they started to move to the right in the 20th century. By the time the 2012 presidential election came around, with Mr. Romney as the candidate, 90 percent of Utah\u2019s Mormons voted Republican. That number is expected to drop significantly this year with Mr. Trump atop the ticket. His shifting positions on social issues, his   views on immigration and his flashy lifestyle clash with Mormon sensibilities that prize humility and charity. And there is his stance against taking in refugees from abroad. \u201cHis rhetoric and the church\u2019s rhetoric on refugees could not be more different,\u201d said J. Quin Monson, an author of \u201cSeeking the Promised Land: Mormons and American Politics. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendance has also divided Utah\u2019s lawmakers, with some reluctantly saying they will support the nominee and others showing resistance. Among the holdouts is Senator Mike Lee, a Mormon whose opposition to Mr. Trump stalled in a floor fight at the Republican convention last month. He articulated in a June interview why the candidate was unpopular, pointing to statements that he said reflected religious intolerance. \u201cMy state consists of members who were a religious minority church  \u2014   a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1839, and statements like that make them nervous,\u201d Mr. Lee said. Facing a tough   fight against a Democrat, Representative Mia Love, a rising Republican star, skipped the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland and gave up her role as a delegate. She has not said if she will vote for Mr. Trump. There have even been some defections. Mark Madsen, a Republican state senator who did attend the convention as a delegate, abandoned the party in frustration in late July and became a Libertarian. Mr. Madsen, who is Mormon, said he thought he was being   into supporting Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to figure out where he is on issues because he\u2019s all over the place,\u201d Mr. Madsen said. \u201cI think he\u2019s frankly boorish and banal. \u201d Sensing opportunity in the air, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents are watching Utah closely. The state has a strong libertarian streak, and Mr. Johnson, whose campaign headquarters is in Salt Lake City, has been returning regularly in hopes that he can capitalize on dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump. That he was governor in nearby New Mexico could help his cause, although if he siphons votes away from Mr. Trump, it could benefit Mrs. Clinton. Democrats are also taking Utah seriously. While they realize that their improved chances in the state are not because their nominee has suddenly surged in popularity, the party would be happy to break its losing streak. \u201cThis is the first time since the   that a Democratic presidential candidate could win in Utah,\u201d said Peter Corroon, the party\u2019s chairman in the state. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not because of the Democrat, it\u2019s because of the Republican. \u201d Nonetheless, the Clinton campaign has staff on the ground in Utah, and it is dispatching former President Bill Clinton to the state for a   event this week. The campaign would not say if Mrs. Clinton would make a trip of her own, but the possibility remains. \u201cThere is no doubt that Donald Trump\u2019s offensive rhetoric has made Utah more competitive than before, and we will continue to assess our options in the state,\u201d said Marlon Marshall, the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of state campaigns and political engagement. Young Republican Mormons such as Mary Weidman give Democrats hope. Sitting outside a soda shop in Provo, Ms. Weidman explained that after supporting Mr. Romney four years ago, she would vote for Mrs. Clinton in November. \u201cI think it\u2019s the lesser of two evils,\u201d Ms. Weidman, 27, said, expressing dismay over how Mr. Trump talks about women. \u201cWhen you think of a leader, he lacks every trait. \u201d Despite such sentiments, it is risky to count Republicans out. While the Trump campaign had no comment about its strategy, the state Republican Party said that Mr. Trump\u2019s team was up and running in Utah. Longtime conservatives who say they are thinking about voting for Mrs. Clinton could have second thoughts on Election Day. \u201cRepublicans at this point are a little unhappy with Trump, but they\u2019re going to vote for him,\u201d said James Evans, the chairman of the state party. That appeared to be the case for Nathan Alder, a    Republican Mormon who goes to Utah Valley University in Orem. \u201cI don\u2019t like Trump, but I probably will vote for him,\u201d Mr. Alder said, explaining that his worries about what he considers Mrs. Clinton\u2019s liberal views narrowly outweighed his fears about Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament. \u201cI am pretty torn. I\u2019m not going to lie. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564555.6045108}
