As a top aide to Mr. Sessions, the conservative Alabama senator, Mr. Miller dispatched dozens and dozens of bombastic emails to congressional staff members and reporters in early 2013 when the Senate was considering a big bipartisan immigration overhaul. Mr. Miller slammed the evils of \u201cforeign labor\u201d and pushed around nasty news articles on proponents of compromise, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. One exhausted Senate staff member, forwarding a   to a reporter at the time, wrote: \u201cHis latest. And it\u2019s only 11:45 a. m. \u201d The ascent of Mr. Miller from   gadfly with little policy experience to the president\u2019s senior policy adviser came as a shock to many of the staff members who knew him from his seven years in the Senate. A man whose emails were, until recently, considered spam by many of his Republican peers is now shaping the Trump administration\u2019s core domestic policies with his economic nationalism and   positions on immigration. But his unlikely rise is emblematic of a White House where unconventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9s rule  \u2014   where the chief strategist is Stephen K. Bannon, until recently the head of the     website Breitbart News, and the president himself is a former reality television star who before winning the nation\u2019s highest office had never shown much interest in the arcana of governing. Yet all three men are bound by a belief in an   economic policy that has suddenly moved from the fringes of American politics to the Oval Office. \u201cStephen was the kind of guy who would make a passionate ideological argument to a roomful of people who were there to make pragmatic decisions,\u201d said Alex Conant, a former aide to Mr. Rubio who remembers squaring off against Mr. Miller at a routine Republican messaging meeting that turned into a   immigration debate. Mr. Miller has been at the epicenter of some of the administration\u2019s most provocative moves, from pushing hard for the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico to threatening   trade deals at the heart of Republican economic orthodoxy, to rolling out Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban on seven largely Muslim nations, whose bungled introduction he oversaw. Working in an administration that \u201cdidn\u2019t come here to do small things,\u201d as Mr. Bannon has put it, is a role that Mr. Miller  \u2014   universally known as a tireless worker  \u2014   has been preparing for much of his life. From his days at a public high school in Southern California, where he preached against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and liberalism and called in to conservative radio shows, to his time at Duke University, where he was known for controversial writings in the student newspaper and a failed attempt at a run for dorm president, he has delighted in challenging prevailing orthodoxies. At a freshman mixer, recalled a college classmate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Miller announced, \u201cMy name is Stephen Miller, I am from Los Angeles, and I like guns. \u201d Mr. Miller, known for his skinny ties,   \u2019  pants and his recently abandoned   habit, enjoyed a relatively   ascent in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit until the travel ban. His eagerness to keep a tight lid on key details of executive orders to prevent leaks  \u2014   as well as his inexperience  \u2014   has at times hampered coordination between the West Wing and agencies that would have to carry them out, several White House officials said. In part to deal with the confusion that surrounded the travel ban, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, recently created a   protocol that requires all major executive actions to be cleared with the communications department and other senior White House staff members before implementation. But Mr. Miller\u2019s peacock confidence has served him well with Mr. Trump, who first got to know him in 2015, when Mr. Miller helped bring Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general, into the Trump fold. After the Republican National Convention in July, Mr. Miller became Mr. Trump\u2019s principal    speechwriter once the candidate had switched from handwritten notes to a teleprompter in the middle of the campaign. The message in those speeches was so reflective of Mr. Trump\u2019s views that it earned Mr. Miller a spot as the   act for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. His words became Mr. Trump\u2019s  \u2014   \u201cWe\u2019re going to build that wall, and we\u2019re going to build it out of love,\u201d Mr. Miller often said. \u201cSteve is a true believer in every sense of the word, not just in this message of economic populism but in President Trump as a leader,\u201d said Jason Miller, who worked with him in the Trump campaign and is not related. \u201cSteve\u2019s fiercely loyal and has a better understanding of the president\u2019s vision than almost anyone. \u201d It is sometimes hard to tell Mr. Trump\u2019s voice from that of Mr. Miller, who suppressed his own orotund speech to capture the president\u2019s more visceral,    style. Not that he has had much choice: As one of three or four staff members to fly around with Mr. Trump during the last few months of the campaign, Mr. Miller was summoned to speechwriting tasks by a bark of \u201cReady!\u201d from Mr. Trump, who insisted on dictating practically every word  \u2014   and laced into staff members who changed a word or inserted an overly complex policy point. Mr. Miller\u2019s flexibility as a speechwriter is offset by the consistent stridency of his political philosophy, which has remained much the same since he was the distinct minority at Santa Monica High School, a liberal outpost where he often railed against fellow students and the school administration. Mexican heritage celebrations and Iraq war protests were things of particular offense. He produced a 2003 essay, \u201cHow I Changed My Left Wing High School,\u201d that capped a high school career steeped in political activism. At Duke, Mr. Miller, who is Jewish, cut a similarly confrontational swath, and was briefly friendly with Richard Spencer, who later became a prominent white supremacist, when both were members of the university\u2019s Young Conservatives chapter. From there, it was straight to Capitol Hill, where Mr. Miller worked for Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and John Shadegg of Arizona before ending up with Mr. Sessions in 2009. Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller worked tirelessly against the   congressional effort at an immigration overhaul. The bill passed the Senate easily in spite of Mr. Sessions\u2019s vociferous objections, but failed in the House. \u201cWe knew we were taking on the establishment, and Steve was an incredibly hard worker and had no second thoughts about it,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in an interview. Mr. Miller wrote many of the incendiary speeches that Mr. Sessions gave about the bill, including one in which he suggested that a   aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been the author of a measure that he believed to be \u201camnesty\u201d in disguise. Ultimately, it was Mr. Miller\u2019s dour views on illegal immigration that endeared him to Mr. Bannon and a small team of   economic nationalists that included Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer. The group came together during the 2014 campaign of the   Republican candidate Dave Brat, whose upset win over the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in a suburban Richmond, Va. district augured Mr. Trump\u2019s success. Even then, Mr. Miller had his eye on Mr. Trump, who had flirted with a run for president in 2012. Soon after Mr. Brat\u2019s victory in the Republican primary in July 2014, Mr. Miller sent his friends a Breitbart interview in which Mr. Trump declared, \u201cEverybody is vulnerable because what\u2019s happening in the country is very sad, and the world is watching. \u201d Mr. Miller added a comment: \u201cTrump gets it. I wish he\u2019d run for president. \u201d Mr. Bannon, Mr. Miller and the   head of the Domestic Policy Council, Andrew Bremberg, spent the later part of the transition period mapping out a    protocol of executive orders, sending more than 200 to federal agencies for review. The trouble came when they sent some of them to   officials at federal agencies for review, leading to leaks that prompted Mr. Miller to restrict the circulation of the plans. Mr. Trump, initially pleased by the bold series of executive actions orchestrated by the team, was stung by the fallout from Mr. Miller\u2019s execution of the immigration order, and expressed frustration about not being fully briefed on an order reorganizing the National Security Council to give Mr. Bannon additional power. Despite the internal   Mr. Miller remains close to the   Mr. Bannon, who described him in an email as \u201ca loyal and faithful soldier in the Trump movement, a warrior for the working class. \u201d In recent days, Mr. Miller has been working on what is expected to be another contentious order: an    rewriting of the guest worker program that is likely to impose new restrictions on the cheap foreign labor that Mr. Miller deplored in many of his 2013 emails, according to two officials familiar with their planning. Mr. Miller, one of the officials said, is working closely with Department of Homeland Security aides to avoid a repeat of the travel ban fiasco.'"}, "time": 1742562874.7396402}
