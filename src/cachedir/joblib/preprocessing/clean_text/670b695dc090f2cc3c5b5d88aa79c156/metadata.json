Her performance was a personal best of 6 feet 2\u00bc inches. At the time, she was 15, having just completed her sophomore year at Reed High School in Sparks, Nev. \u201cThere was a youthful elasticity about her,\u201d said Amy Acuff, a   Olympian who finished third at those trials. \u201cYou could see a bounce and a spring in her movements. She was such a fresh, bright spirit. It can be difficult to have your best performance in a big meet like that, but she definitely rose to the occasion. \u201d For the    Williams, now 20, a   career ended prematurely with a severe knee injury sustained months later while playing basketball. But she remains a soaring presence around the basket and, after a tentative start at UConn, she has become as dependable in the biggest moments on the court as she once was on the track infield. On Monday, Williams, a junior, collected 23 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists as UConn ( ) defeated Syracuse   in the second round of the N. C. A. A. tournament. It was a rematch of the 2016 national championship game, won easily by the Huskies for their fourth consecutive title. That UConn team featured Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck, the top three players chosen in the 2016 W. N. B. A. draft. For the first time, Williams and her current teammates are being asked to deliver crucial plays at decisive moments in the postseason. \u201cThis entire team is really anxious about that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cLast year, we had guys, they knew how to win a national championship and they had done it before. We know how, but we\u2019ve never had to do it ourselves. \u201d She does not appear overwhelmed by the responsibility. In Saturday\u2019s tournament opener, Williams delivered 20 points, 10 rebounds, 6 assists, 5 steals and a blocked shot as UConn overwhelmed Albany,  . Such resourceful performances validate what Jay Bilas, the ESPN announcer, said of Williams: She is the most complete college basketball player in the country, male or female. Her   and   skills need refining, but there is a calm, floating assurance about Williams. The elegant way she imposes herself on a game with her vision, positioning and anticipation. Her ability not only to jump high, but also to quickly jump a second time, a third time. Her graceful, bounding glide, always on the balls of her feet, as if there is an unseen   bar to clear. Standing about eight feet from the basket against Albany, Williams rose over the back of a player three and a half inches taller and snatched a rebound. Another time, she hovered in the lane, legs scissored, cradling a rebound in one arm. \u201cWilliams has to be maybe one of the most athletic players ever,\u201d said Joanna   the Albany coach. \u201cSome of those rebounds she grabs are very phenomenal. Her legs are like springs. \u201d As Williams\u2019s basketball skills have expanded in college, so has her social awareness. In an interview in December with The New Haven Register, Williams said she wanted to become a community organizer. \u201cI am going to be a black female after basketball,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cI want to make sure every day that I am trying to make a difference. \u201d Speaking to The New York Times as the N. C. A. A. tournament opened, Williams said that while basketball consumed much of her time during the season, she tried to attend meetings at UConn\u2019s African American Cultural Center whenever possible. The election of President Trump has prompted anxious discussions about treatment of women, minorities and immigrants, and she has eagerly taken part in them. \u201cI\u2019m glad these issues are finally being talked about,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see people who are more motivated, like, \u2018What can I do now? \u2019\u201d If things had gone as planned in high school, Williams would have returned to UConn\u2019s basketball team this season after taking a year away from the game to try to qualify for the high jump at the Rio Olympics. \u201cNow I realize just how almost impossible that was, to think it was going to be so easy just to take a year off,\u201d Williams said, laughing. That is what    are supposed to think, that life is infinite possibility. But her plans were circumscribed when Williams\u2019s right knee crumpled with a torn anterior cruciate ligament midway through her junior season in high school. She injured the knee again as a senior. A second operation followed. When she was cleared to resume athletic activities, she said, \u201cI kind of had a realization that I wanted to do basketball more than I wanted to do track. \u201d But Williams arrived at UConn in the fall of 2014 neither fully fit nor confident. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready for that level of competition,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of got down on myself all the time. \u201d On Nov. 17, 2014, UConn played what would become a signpost game at Stanford. The Huskies lost,   in overtime, ending a   winning streak. They had not lost in 109 games played since. But Williams also remembers that game for a different reason. She did not play a single minute. Coach Geno Auriemma did not yet trust her. Her teammates did not yet trust her. She did not trust herself. After Williams missed large stretches of her final two seasons in high school, Auriemma said, she was asking herself, \u201cCan I do this or not?\u201d Doubt, he said, consumed her. After the Stanford game, Williams said, \u201cI never wanted to feel that way again. \u201d She told herself: \u201cI need to find a role on this team. I need to find a way that I can help. \u201d This season she became a   starter. While she remains a work in progress, Williams played some of her most thorough games during the regular season against teams that are now fellow No. 1 seeds in the N. C. A. A. tournament: 19 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals against Notre Dame. A   26 points, along with 14 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 steals, against South Carolina. She was named defensive player of the year in the American Athletic Conference and became only the fifth UConn player to collect a   with 16 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists against East Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to underappreciate her,\u201d Maya Moore, a former UConn star, said of Williams. \u201cBut if you watch the game and understand all the ways she\u2019s impacting it, it\u2019s   to see that night after night. She\u2019s grown into that, to be able to be counted on in so many areas of the game. \u201d Doubts still affect Williams \u201conce in a while,\u201d Auriemma said, \u201cbut fortunately for us, every big game we played on national television, those doubts didn\u2019t come to the arena. \u201d \u201cSomehow or another,\u201d he added, \u201cthey got lost on the way over. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562847.1376066}
