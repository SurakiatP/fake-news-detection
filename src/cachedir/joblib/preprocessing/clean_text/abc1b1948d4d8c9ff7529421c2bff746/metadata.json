Although friends and foes alike faulted him for not following through on his threat to retaliate when Syria gassed its own people in 2013, Mr. Obama would counter that he had actually achieved a better result through an agreement with President Bashar   to surrender all of his chemical weapons. After last week, even former Obama aides assume that he will have to rethink that passage in his memoir. More than 80 civilians were killed in what Western analysts called a sarin attack by Syrian forces  \u2014   a chilling demonstration that the agreement did not succeed. In recent days, former aides have lamented what they considered one of the worst moments of the Obama presidency and privately conceded that his legacy would suffer. \u201cIf the Syrian government carried out the attack and the agent was sarin, then clearly the 2013 agreement didn\u2019t succeed in its objective of eliminating Bashar\u2019s C. W.,\u201d or chemical weapons, said Robert Einhorn, who was the State Department special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control under Mr. Obama before the agreement. \u201cEither he didn\u2019t declare all his C. W. and kept some hidden in reserve, or he illegally produced some sarin after his stock was eliminated  \u2014   most likely the former. \u201d Other former Obama advisers questioned the wisdom of negotiating with Mr. Assad and said last week\u2019s attack illustrated the flaws in the deal, which was brokered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a way to prevent the United States from using force. \u201cFor me, this tragedy underscores the dangers of trying to do deals with dictators without a comprehensive, invasive and permanent inspection regime,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to Russia. \u201cIt also shows the limits of doing deals with Putin. Surely, the Russians must have known about these C. W. \u201d Putting the best face on it, former Obama advisers said it was better to have removed 1, 300 tons of chemical weapons from Syria even if Mr. Assad cheated and kept some, or later developed more. \u201cImagine what Syria would look like without that deal,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state. \u201cIt would be awash in chemical weapons, which would fall into the hands of ISIS, Al Nusra or other groups. \u201d Still, the administration knew all along that it had probably not gotten all of the chemical weapons, and tried to get Russia to help press Syria, without success. \u201cWe always knew we had not gotten everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration,\u201d Mr. Blinken said. Even before last week\u2019s chemical attack, many veterans of Mr. Obama\u2019s team considered his handling of Syria his biggest failing and expressed regret that their administration did not stop a war that has left more than 400, 000 dead and millions displaced. Many of them even praised President Trump for taking the very action that Mr. Obama refused to take four years ago, by ordering a cruise missile strike against Syria. \u201cDonald Trump has done the right thing on Syria,\u201d   Slaughter, the director of policy planning in Mr. Obama\u2019s State Department, wrote on Twitter. \u201cFinally!! After years of useless handwringing in the face of hideous atrocities. \u201d Tom Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state for human rights for Mr. Obama, wrote in The Atlantic, \u201cThe lesson I would draw from that experience is that when dealing with mass killing by unconventional or conventional means, deterrence is more effective than disarmament. \u201d Mr. Obama grappled with Syria for much of his tenure but resisted being directly drawn in, for fear of thrusting America into another Middle East quagmire without solving the problem. The most searing moment came in 2013, when Mr. Assad\u2019s forces killed 1, 400 civilians with chemical weapons, brazenly crossing what Mr. Obama had said would be his \u201cred line. \u201d Mr. Obama prepared a military strike to retaliate, but hesitated amid domestic opposition in both parties and asked Congress to decide whether to proceed. When it became clear that Congress would not give its approval, he grabbed onto a political lifeline from Mr. Putin, who proposed a deal in which Mr. Assad would give up his chemical weapons arsenal. Under the deal, Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention, and over the next nine months, vast stores of lethal poisons were removed and ultimately destroyed. In June 2014, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons certified that all of Syria\u2019s declared weapons had been removed. Two months later, when the last chemicals were destroyed, Mr. Obama celebrated. \u201cToday we mark an important achievement in our ongoing effort to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction by eliminating Syria\u2019s declared chemical weapons stockpile,\u201d he said in a statement. In the months to come, Mr. Obama and his aides pointed to that agreement in response to criticism that he had failed to enforce his red line. \u201cWell, it turns out we\u2019re getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike,\u201d Mr. Obama said in April 2014. \u201cSo what else are you talking about?\u201d Three months later, Secretary of State John Kerry said, \u201cWith respect to Syria, we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out. \u201d And three months after that, Mr. Kerry said Mr. Obama\u2019s threat of force had made it possible to \u201ccut the deal that got 100 percent of the declared chemical weapons out of Syria, and people nevertheless have been critical  \u2014   one day of bombing versus the virtue of getting 100 percent of the chemical weapons out of Syria. \u201d As late as this January, Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, said on NPR: \u201cWe were able to find a solution that didn\u2019t necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished. We were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile. \u201d Publicly, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers sometimes referred to \u201cknown\u201d or \u201cdeclared\u201d stockpiles to qualify their claims, and sometimes did not. But from the start of the deal, there were discrepancies in Mr. Assad\u2019s weapons declarations. In February 2016, James R. Clapper Jr. the national intelligence director, told Congress that \u201cwe assess that Syria has not declared all the elements of its chemical weapons program. \u201d Moreover, Mr. Assad\u2019s forces resorted to makeshift chlorine bombs, using a chemical that was not covered by the agreement and is not barred by international law, though its use as a weapon of war is. Mr. Blinken said the Obama administration had pressed the United Nations to respond, but Russia blocked such efforts. Critics say Mr. Obama oversold the agreement with Russia. \u201cThe defense was that he got all the C. W. out, and now that defense is shown to be plain false,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, a deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cIf Obama administration officials knew that at the time, they were deliberately misstating the facts. I think Obama will never live this down, nor should he. \u201d Frederic C. Hof, who worked on Syria policy at the State Department under Mr. Obama before leaving and becoming a sharp critic of the administration, said the agreement remained defensible because it took weapons out of Mr. Assad\u2019s hands. But Mr. Hof noted that Mr. Assad was still left \u201cfree to perform mass homicide by other means,\u201d and that neither Mr. Obama\u2019s deal nor Mr. Trump\u2019s missile strike would stop him. \u201cHe now counts on the West again to leave him free to kill as long as he does so without chemicals,\u201d Mr. Hof said. \u201cIf this is what happens, the U. S. airstrikes of April 7 will go down in history as a        gesture that did nothing to counter violent extremism, stop mass homicide or restore the reputation of the U. S. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564416.5956106}
