The annual hazing routine that forces rookies to dress in outlandish costumes for a day, including having some dress as women, had taken on more prominence in recent years because photographs of the ritual were showing up on social media outlets. The people who came to Bean said they felt that the costumes that depicted women were often demeaning and offensive and now were being seen everywhere. He relayed the concerns to other people in the commissioner\u2019s office and in the players\u2019 union, the Major League Baseball Players Association, and so began a conversation that has now led to a rule change stitched into the new collective bargaining agreement. The general practice of making rookies wear costumes is still permitted. Players can dress in pajamas or as superheroes or overgrown babies. But no one may wear costumes depicting women, whether willingly or forced into it. \u201cWe are the sport of Jackie Robinson, and we need to lead by example,\u201d Bean said. \u201cWe are not trying to take the fun away from the players. This is no different than making sexist comments about women in the workplace or about people\u2019s religious beliefs or ethnic background or the language they speak or their sexual orientation. \u201d The new rule prohibits anyone from dressing up as women or wearing costumes that may be offensive to individuals based on their race, sex, nationality, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or other characteristics. While other sports have their own hazing rituals, such as forcing rookies to sing their college fight songs in public, it is baseball that is identified with the wearing of costumes. Bean, a former major league player who came out publicly as gay in 1999, was hired in 2014 to lead baseball\u2019s efforts at inclusion. He said that when he played in the 1980s and \u201890s, the hazing rituals usually included activities like carrying luggage for veterans. The practice of having the rookies dress in costumes has also existed for decades, Bean said, but back then, it was not publicized the way it is today. One concern is that players in high schools and colleges might increasingly emulate the costume hazing now that it has become more visible on social media, and would do so in an unsupervised manner. Although some major league rookies have objected to the custom of dressing up in costumes, which usually takes place late in the season, others have thought of it as funny and happily posed for photos. Earlier this year, the Mets veterans made their rookies, including the reserve outfielder Brandon Nimmo, don dresses and wigs as characters from the film \u201cA League Of Their Own. \u201d \u201cI guess I\u2019m sad to see that go,\u201d Nimmo said Tuesday when asked about the new ban on such costumes. \u201cNot my decision, but I\u2019m glad I got to partake in it last year. I wouldn\u2019t trade that. \u201d Nimmo spoke as he was participating in the annual Mets holiday party at Citi Field. He was dressed as an elf, which, under the new rule, would not be of bounds, Christmas party or no Christmas party. Also at Citi Field on Tuesday was the Mets\u2019   pitcher Noah Syndergaard, who was playing the role of Santa Claus  \u2014   a fuzzy blue one in this instance. He recalled being part of a rookie ritual in 2015 in Cincinnati in which he and his fellow   players had to put on tight underwear and pajamas and walk the streets of the city. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I understand it,\u201d Syndergaard said when asked about the new rule banning women\u2019s costumes. \u201cBut I have no say in it. \u201d Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said he frowned on the whole practice of having major league rookies dress up in costumes, regardless of what outfits they wore. A former Marine, Alderson noted that there had been similar practices in the military. \u201cIt\u2019s divisive and undercuts morale,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it constructive? Is it useful? Is it juvenile? It\u2019s probably juvenile. It\u2019s probably not useful or constructive in too many ways. \u201d In 1999, a Mets hazing ritual actually turned violent when the   rookie Jorge Toca, a reserve first baseman and outfielder, refused to participate. Shortstop Rey Ordonez, who was also from Cuba, obstinately defended Toca, and when the tension escalated, Ordonez wound up being punched in the face by another Mets teammate, the utility player Luis Lopez. \u201cDo you want an activity that is supposed to be a uniter turn into a divider?\u201d asked Al Leiter, a pitcher on that team and now a television baseball analyst. \u201cEspecially at that time of the year, when you are headed into the postseason? \u201cAnd as an industry, do you really want your star players being photographed in a thong? Does it make sense to have photographs of Bryce Harper or Mike Trout dressed in a   or a ballerina tutu? If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t want that. \u201d In 1996, Los Angeles Dodgers veterans cut up a dress suit belonging to pitcher Chan Ho Park, then in his first full season in the major leagues. Park exploded, screaming invectives and throwing furniture and food around the clubhouse. Most cases are less volatile. Years ago, the   prospect Drew Henson of the Yankees was made to wear a wedding dress, and pitcher   Wang and second baseman Robinson Cano were made to dress as female Yankee cheerleaders. When the Expos existed, National League teams liked to time their hazing events with their exit from Montreal, forcing the rookies to wear their costumes in public through customs. Bean said those who might criticize the new rule as being just another example of political correctness would be missing the point. \u201cThe people who are making a majority of those comments are not the people that those jokes are directed at,\u201d Bean said, \u201cand that is an easy seat to sit in and point fingers and say you are ruining something. \u201d In any case, not all the costumes are sexually oriented. Sometimes, players dress as superheroes, or as Elvis Presley, or, as the Yankees recently did, as 1980s rappers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give the players the opportunity to show how creative they can be in a way that is not shaming or disparaging anyone that is part of that club, or a fan that might sit in one of their seats during their 81 home games,\u201d Bean said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a responsibility they can meet, and I hope we are remembered for putting this conversation out there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628448.2135992}
