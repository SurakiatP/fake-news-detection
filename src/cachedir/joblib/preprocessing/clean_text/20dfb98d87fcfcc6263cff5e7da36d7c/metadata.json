S.  tech companies whose employees were swindled out of $100 million by a Lithuanian hacker in the last three years. [The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Lithuanian Evaldas Rima\u0161aukas. The   was described as a fraudulent business email compromise scheme that tricked two sophisticated U. S.  internet companies to wire over $100 million to Rima\u0161aukas\u2019 bank accounts in Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong.  Although the U. S. Justice Department initially screened the names of the scammed U. S. companies, Fortune on April 27 identified what prosecutors had referred to in the federal indictment as Victim 1, as Google, and Victim 2, as Facebook. Rima\u0161aukas beginning in 2013, \u201cforged email addresses, invoices, and corporate stamps in a scam to impersonate a large   manufacturer with whom the tech firms regularly did business. \u201d The Endgaget blog identified Taiwanese parts supplier Rima\u0161aukas impersonated as Quanta Computer. The company is a huge supplier to numerous tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. The Department of Justice describes Business Email Compromise (BEC) as a sophisticated scam that targets business deals with foreign suppliers and regularly issues electronic wire transfer payments. The scheme usually seeks to compromise access to legitimate supplier business   accounts through social engineering or   techniques. The fraudsters then request the victims to make unauthorized electronic fund transfers by disguising their activities to appear consistent with normal business practices. The FBI collaborated with Google, Facebook, their banks, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, and other law enforcement agencies in the Republic of Lithuania to trace the footprints of Rima\u0161aukas\u2019 phishing attacks and make the arrest at his home in Vilnius. Rima\u0161aukas was indicted by the U. S. Justice Department Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit for identity theft, money laundering, and wire fraud. Federal sentencing guidelines state that conviction for such offenses carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 24 years. Acting U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim, said in a Justice Department announcement, \u201cThis case should serve as a   call to all companies  \u2014   even the most sophisticated  \u2014   that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals. \u201d Rimasauskas, facing extradition from Lithuania, denied the allegations. Rima\u0161aukas claims that he is innocent and intends to fight extradition to the United States. His attorney at the Cobalt firm, Linas Kuprusevicius, told Fortune in an email: \u201cMr. Rimasauskas cannot expect a fair and impartial trial in the U. S. A. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562129.1088693}
