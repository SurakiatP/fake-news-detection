When asked about going into politics, Jenner said, \u201cI have been asked that question quite a bit, to be honest with you over the next year I\u2019m looking into it.

Is it from the outside? Kind of working on the outside and in the perimeter and working with everybody to get the Republicans to change their thinking? Or is it better off being on the inside and actually running for a Congress or Senate seat or whatever it may be? Can I do more good there? And those are the things that I am evaluating. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561758.8582482}
