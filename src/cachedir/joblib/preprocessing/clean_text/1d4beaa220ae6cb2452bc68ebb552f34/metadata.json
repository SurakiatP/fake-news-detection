What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022   Donald J. Trump\u2019s first appointment put a Washington insider  \u2014   Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee  \u2014   in the crucial gatekeeping role of chief of staff. He also named Stephen K. Bannon, the   media mogul, chief strategist. As Mr. Trump fills out his administration, the appointees will lend shape to a   chaotic agenda, offering the strongest signals yet on whether and how he will carry out campaign promises like deporting millions of illegal immigrants, scrapping trade pacts and   traditional alliances. An immediate question is how Mr. Trump will handle potential overlaps between his vast business dealings and his political role, given that his adult children are leading his transition team and also running his businesses. _____ \u2022 Protests against Mr. Trump\u2019s election continued. In one of the largest, on Saturday, masses of marchers descended on Trump Tower in Manhattan, Mr. Trump\u2019s   headquarters and home, some chanting, \u201cNot my president!\u201d More protests are planned, including one aimed at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. Facebook\u2019s executives held meetings with staff members and the company\u2019s policy team to try to assuage concerns that misinformation and fake news articles shared on the platform had influenced the election\u2019s outcome. _____ \u2022 President Obama is on his way to Europe, where he will face leaders he had long assured that Mr. Trump could not be elected. Their meetings will now be shadowed by uncertainty over the United States\u2019 commitment to NATO. Mr. Obama will visit Athens and Berlin before heading to Lima, Peru, for a summit meeting of the   Economic Cooperation forum. For about half the member states, the gathering will be clouded by the death of the   Partnership trade deal. Mr. Obama is expected to meet on the sidelines with President Xi Jinping of China, a major beneficiary of the pact\u2019s demise, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. _____ \u2022 New Zealand is assessing the damage from a 7.  earthquake that hit near Christchurch, triggering multiple tsunami waves and forcing evacuations along a stretch of the coastline. At least two people were killed. Military helicopters have been deployed to coastal towns, such as Kaikoura, that have been cut off. _____ \u2022 \u201cDid you vote for me to abolish corruption?\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi bellowed in a speech, furious over criticism of his abrupt ban on India\u2019s two largest bank notes. \u201cIf you asked me, should I do it or not?\u201d His move crippled commerce at markets around the country and left millions standing in line for hours at banks and A. T. M. s. depositing about $45 billion in the devalued notes and taking out $7. 5 billion in new currency. _____ \u2022 Interviews with more than two dozen military medical personnel who served or consulted at the American military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, reveal how secrecy, mistrust and the shadow of interrogation limited doctors\u2019 ability to treat detainees who became mentally ill, some after being subjected to torture or other harsh coercive practices. One was Ramzi bin   an admitted and unapologetic   in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. _____ \u2022 Alibaba reported $17. 73 billion in sales on Singles Day on Friday. The total was a 32 percent increase from 2015, about half the previous year\u2019s increase, largely because consumers spent less per purchase. \u2022 Toyota Motors agreed to pay up to $3. 4 billion to settle a federal class action lawsuit accusing the company of inadequate rust protection on 1. 5 million pickups and sport utility vehicles sold in the United States. \u2022 Japan said its economy grew an annualized 2. 2 percent in the third quarter, exceeding estimates. \u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Prosecutors are preparing to question President Park   over an   scandal, a first for a sitting South Korean president. [Yonhap] \u2022 The first female pilot of China\u2019s   fighter jet, who was reported killed in a training accident, was remembered as a \u201cgolden peacock. \u201d [South China Morning Post] \u2022 Myanmar government troops burned Rohingya villages as tensions between Buddhists and Muslims escalated in restive Rakhine State. [The New York Times] \u2022 Analysts in Indonesia see the enormous Muslim protest this month against the governor of Jakarta as the camouflaged opening salvo in a political campaign to unseat President Joko Widodo. [The New York Times] \u2022 China recycles just 20 percent of its packaging material, leaving landfills overloaded in the aftermath of Singles Day. [Caixin] \u2022 The United States has agreed to take in refugees currently being housed on the Pacific island nation of Nauru in a   agreement with the Australian government. [The New York Times] \u2022 A year after the Islamic State attacks in Paris that killed 130 people and wounded nearly 500, survivors and witnesses shared their stories. [The New York Times] \u2022 Chinese women traditionally retain their surnames at marriage, but doing so is an expression of powerful patriarchal values, not, as in the West, of female empowerment. \u2022 Less than a week ago, it appeared that a woman would break the    gender barrier to the United States presidency. Here is a collection of stories from American women about the barriers they\u2019ve faced. \u2022 Leon Russell, the   rock \u2019n\u2019 roll songwriter and star, died in Nashville. He was 74. The baseball World Series and the United States presidential election were two possible     events this month. Look to tonight\u2019s sky and you\u2019ll be in for one more. The   supermoon makes a beaming return to the night sky. It\u2019s the closest full moon to Earth since 1948. If you missed it early this morning, you can catch tonight\u2019s rise in spectacular fashion. The moon tonight will appear significantly larger and brighter than usual. (Though some people, our science writer included, argue that the event is overhyped.) You may also hear references to the Beaver Moon, a moniker that the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac traces to Native Americans\u2019 naming moons to track the seasons. In August, there\u2019s the Sturgeon Moon, when the fish were readily available in the Great Lakes region of the United States. The Strawberry Moon rises in June when the fruit is at its ripest. This week\u2019s moon rise coincides with the time of year beaver traps were set out, before the first freeze. \u201cThere are a lot of cool things to find in the night sky these days,\u201d a NASA researcher, Noah Petro said, but tonight is the night \u201cto enjoy the moon. \u201d Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
