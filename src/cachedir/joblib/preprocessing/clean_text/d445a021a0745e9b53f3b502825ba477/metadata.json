[Carney cheerfully veered off topic five seconds into his talk with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, expressing his fascination with the current discussion of voter fraud, and wondering how anyone can claim there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of a problem the authorities resolutely refuse to study in a serious way.  \u201cHow would they know whether there\u2019s illegal voting, when you don\u2019t have to show an ID?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey say there\u2019s no evidence. How would anybody know? Who\u2019s been investigating? There\u2019s no evidence because nobody\u2019s been looking. \u201d \u201cI vote here in New York. Nobody checks IDs. You just walk in, you give them your address, and you go on in and vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be really easy for there to be voter fraud. \u201d Marlow recalled the infamous  \u2014   but evidently not infamous enough  \u2014   incident in 2012 when an undercover filmmaker working for James O\u2019Keefe was handed Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s ballot. \u201cI cover Wall Street, and one thing we know about Wall Street  \u2014   and it applies to everything  \u2014   but when we make fraud really easy, fraud always happens,\u201d Carney pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019s a rule. If fraud is easy, fraud occurs. \u201d Marlow noted that while the media obsess over President Trump\u2019s claim that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election, the Dow hit 20, 000, and everything \u201cseems to be going Trump\u2019s way. \u201d \u201cAnd now he\u2019s got the media focused on basically defending themselves for not covering this widespread fraud, and it\u2019s a fraud not just in a literal sense, but also in the figurative sense, that the mainstream media has allowed this to happen because they have shown no interest in voter integrity,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cYou would think this would be a huge story, but of course, it\u2019s one that wasn\u2019t in the interests of the mainstream media to cover, so they ignored it,\u201d Carney agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another one of these stories that, I think, is going to wind up being one of the greatest unreported stories  \u2014   that now we\u2019ll get to the bottom of this. \u201d As Carney has assumed the lead role in Breitbart News\u2019 financial and economic coverage, Marlow was most eager for his thoughts on the historic stock market high. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s a big milestone that reminds us how far we\u2019ve come, just since election week,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 9. 5 percent just since Election Day, which is a big deal. \u201d \u201cJust to give a sense, on average, the SP  \u2014   which is a broader index, the SP 500, more stocks  \u2014   is up about 7. 4 percent. On average, it\u2019s about 7 percent a year,\u201d he noted. \u201cIn just a couple of months since Election Day, we\u2019re up what we usually do in about a year. Investors are very excited about the changes they see coming. \u201d As Marlow observed, this is the exact opposite of what many in the press predicted would occur after Trump won the election. \u201cI\u2019m divided in my own mind about whether it was just pure scare tactics or the bias of both the press and a lot of economists,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThere were very prominent economists who were saying if Donald Trump is elected, the stock market will fall ten, fifteen percent. Beforehand, I understood this didn\u2019t make any sense, and there were some of us out there saying no, why would the stock market fall? It will rise if you get a guy who\u2019s going to pare back government regulation and cut taxes. \u201d  \u201cThis is actually what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d he asserted. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of hope reborn. Economists are actually now moving up their economic expectations. Everybody from the Federal Reserve now expects the economy to grow a little bit faster. The International Monetary Fund, of all places, has said they think under Trump, the economy will grow faster. \u201d  \u201cInvestors had gotten very used to the idea that projections about where the economy was going were going to keep being lower and lower and lower,\u201d he explained. \u201cEver since the great financial crisis, we would begin each year with some sort of rosy expectations, and then everybody would say, \u201cOh no, it\u2019s going to be worse.\u2019 For the first time in a long time, we\u2019re actually seeing people move up their economic expectations. When it comes to the stock market, that translates into investors seeing more upsides than downsides. \u201d  \u201cIn other words, people are willing to look at the future and say, \u2018You know what? I think the risk is that we do better than we thought, rather than worse, which translates into higher stock prices.\u2019 The   term for this is just: people have hope again,\u201d Carney said. Carney said Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts were one of the major policy initiatives driving this sense of renewed optimism in the markets. \u201cIf you cut the corporate tax rate, that just translates directly into higher earnings for companies,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnother is the possibility of companies being able to move,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve been hearing for years about how companies hold all this money abroad because they\u2019re afraid to repatriate it, reinvest it in the U. S. economy, because they\u2019re going to get a big tax hit. Well, if we cut taxes, a lot of that money can come back, get reinvested in expanding business in the U. S. which means more jobs, and, more importantly, better jobs for the American people. When the American people have better jobs, that means they can spend more, buy more, save more, and invest more. So there\u2019s a sort of virtuous cycle going on here where that pushes up stocks. \u201d Carney also saluted Trump\u2019s cabinet picks as being people who don\u2019t \u201csee business as the enemy. \u201d \u201cThese are guys who think that one of the things we need to do is remove some of the regulatory barriers that stand in the way of Americans expanding their businesses, starting their own businesses. That is really helping fuel this enthusiasm about the economy, and, therefore, about the stock market,\u201d he said. Marlow pointed out that Trump has been criticized precisely for putting \u201ctoo many Wall Street guys\u201d in his cabinet, making it look like \u201ca Goldman boardroom. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something funny about that, right?\u201d Carney responded. \u201cA lot of the guys who they say are Wall Street guys or Goldman guys haven\u2019t been on Wall Street or at Goldman for a long time. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary nominee, he hasn\u2019t touched Goldman Sachs for a long time. A guy very familiar to Breitbart people, Steve Bannon  \u2014   yeah, he was at Goldman at one point, but that was ages ago. So a little bit of that is phony. \u201d  \u201cThere are guys actually direct from Goldman, like Gary Cohn was president, he was the number two guy at Goldman. You know what? I think that it\u2019s actually a sign of, rather than Donald Trump being sort of   by Wall Street, Wall Street being   by Donald Trump,\u201d he mused.  \u201cIn other words, Goldman wasn\u2019t a friend of Donald Trump\u2019s before he got elected, but now these guys are saying, \u2018You know what? Let\u2019s be a part of what\u2019s happening in the American economy. This is a really exciting time. I want to be a part of this.\u2019 So I welcome it,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than standing in opposition, I think there was a lot of fatalism,\u201d Carney theorized. \u201cPeople said, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re going to get on Hillary Clinton\u2019s side because we think it\u2019s just going to be another eight years of Obama followed by the Clintons.\u2019 They see change in the air, and they say, \u2018You know what? Let\u2019s get on board. \u2019\u201d Carney anticipated that markets would \u201ccontinue to go higher. \u201d \u201cAfter we hit 20, 000 yesterday, we stayed above 20, 000. We\u2019re set to go even higher today,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cToday is my birthday, so I look at this almost as a birthday gift for me. We\u2019re going to open for the first time higher than 20, 000 on my birthday, and it\u2019s largely because we elected a guy who is going to improve the American economy, and it\u2019s going to just keep happening. It\u2019s a very helpful sign, not just for investors. Investors are enthusiastic because they believe the economy is getting better. We\u2019ve thrown off the slow growth of the last eight years, and we\u2019re set for something better. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
