Stringer, said on Tuesday that his office would audit the city\u2019s Board of Elections in part to determine if tens of thousands of Democratic voters were improperly removed from voter rolls. Mr. Stringer said in a statement that the Board of Elections had confirmed that more than 125, 000 Democratic voters in Brooklyn were dropped between November 2015 and this month. He said the decline occurred \u201cwithout any adequate explanation furnished by the Board of Elections. \u201d \u201cThere is nothing more sacred in our nation than the right to vote, yet election after election, reports come in of people who were inexplicably purged from the polls, told to vote at the wrong location or unable to get in to their polling site,\u201d Mr. Stringer, a Democrat, said. On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio, also a Democrat, echoed Mr. Stringer, noting that voters and voting rights monitors had reported the \u201cpurging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists. \u201d \u201cThe perception that numerous voters may have been disenfranchised undermines the integrity of the entire electoral process and must be fixed,\u201d the mayor said in a statement. Michael J. Ryan, the executive director of the elections board, said that while approximately 125, 000 were removed from voter rolls in Brooklyn since the fall, some 63, 000 people were added. He said the decline did not \u201cshock my conscience\u201d because there were 800, 000 registered Democrats in Brooklyn, and thousands of people were added and removed from the list every year. There was a \u201creport a couple years ago that said there were people on the lists who didn\u2019t belong there,\u201d Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday. \u201cNow we take people off the list who don\u2019t belong there,\u201d he continued, \u201cand there\u2019s some blowback, criticism that we\u2019ve done it inaccurately. \u201d The drop in registered Democrats was first reported by WNYC. Other issues also surfaced that blocked New Yorkers from voting. When Karishma Desai, a graduate student, arrived at her polling place around 7:30 a. m. she found it closed, an hour and a half after the polls were scheduled to open. \u201cI was already late to work,\u201d she said, so she left without casting a ballot. Mr. Ryan said the polling site coordinator failed to show up at Ms. Desai\u2019s polling place, the Atlantic Terminal Senior Citizens Center in Brooklyn. Additional staff members were called in, he said, and it was open and functioning smoothly by midmorning. He also said \u201can army of technicians\u201d was dispatched around the city to address technical problems with some voting machines. He said that the issues on Tuesday were typical for an Election Day, but that the importance of this primary made the spotlight more intense. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing anything that is so wildly out of the ordinary as to cause me to be tremendously concerned that there are widespread problems, because there certainly are not,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe understand that the eyes and ears of the world are truly on New York City today, and it\u2019s understandable. \u201d Ms. Desai, a Democrat, returned to her polling place on Tuesday afternoon and was able to vote. She said she voted for Senator Bernie Sanders.'"}, "time": 1742562366.5103285}
