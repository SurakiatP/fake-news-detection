It\u2019s the story of a wealthy married woman, the Marschallin, who is having an affair with a much younger man, and who realizes that she is getting older and that he will sooner or later move on. Her most famous aria, at the end of the first act, is about wanting to stop the clocks. At the end of the opera, to music so full of feeling Strauss wanted it played at his own funeral, she accepts the inevitable and graciously surrenders her lover to a younger woman. Robert Carsen\u2019s new staging of \u201cRosenkavalier,\u201d which had its debut in London this winter and opens at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday, April 13, emphasizes the theme of change and upheaval by moving the setting from   Vienna to the moment when the piece was written, at the twilight of the Hapsburg Empire and the eve of World War I. It becomes an opera about the end of an era, or even the end of the world. For Ren\u00e9e Fleming, the superstar soprano who will sing the Marschallin at the Met, and for music, this really is the end of an era: This \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d may well be her farewell to staged opera. She will sing her final performance on the afternoon of Saturday, May 13. People who know Ms. Fleming, 58, say that she has been planning this moment for years. The novelist Ann Patchett, who became friends with her after finishing \u201cBel Canto,\u201d about a diva with many   traits, said recently: \u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve known Ren\u00e9e, the thing she always talks about is the fact that it\u2019s all going to end. She has always had this feeling: \u2018I\u2019m a carton of yogurt with an expiration date stamped on it, and that day will come and I\u2019ll be thrown out. \u2019\u201d So Ms. Fleming is trying to say goodbye on her own terms. \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to be saying, \u2018Oh my God, please stop,\u2019\u201d she said in London as she prepared to finish the \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d run there. \u201cOr, \u2018I heard her when. \u2019\u201d Her departure is a watershed moment for her extravagant, expensive art form, which is always imagining itself in trouble  \u2014   what is opera about except crises?  \u2014   but may really be in peril this time. Not only is opera more divorced than ever from mainstream culture, but also its core audience, the people who buy subscriptions, is literally dying off. The Met has had some luck attracting new operagoers through social media, collaborations with theater and visual artists, and fresher branding, but the most reliable way of ensuring attendance is still by casting big international stars, and one of Ms. Fleming\u2019s magnitude is almost impossible to replace. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, the only singer on her level still performing, is 76, and, though he keeps defying time, can\u2019t go on forever younger artists like Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kaufmann may be   but are hardly household names. \u201cA superstar is that intangible thing,\u201d said Mary Lou Falcone, the publicist who in 1998 helped guide Ms. Fleming through a crisis of confidence so severe she almost quit opera after being booed in Milan. \u201cNothing can explain it. After all the projections and trajectories, the public either latches on or it doesn\u2019t. \u201d Drawn to Ms. Fleming\u2019s combination of glamour and accessibility  \u2014   she became known as \u201cthe people\u2019s diva\u201d  \u2014   the public did latch on. Invited to sing David Letterman\u2019s Top 10 list, and to record, in the original Elvish, some of the soundtrack for the third \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d movie, she gained a following among people who, strictly speaking, weren\u2019t opera buffs at all. In many cases, Ms. Fleming was the first and only opera singer they\u2019d ever paid attention to. She has sold over two million records, a huge number for opera, and won four Grammy Awards. In 2014, she became the first opera singer to deliver the national anthem at the Super Bowl. In 2015, she made the jump from Lincoln Center to Broadway to appear (as a tetchy diva) in the play \u201cLiving on Love. \u201d \u201cHer huge ambition was not just to be an opera star,\u201d said Matthew Epstein, Ms. Fleming\u2019s manager from 1995 to 1999. \u201cShe wanted to be Beyonc\u00e9. She still does. \u201d Like Beyonc\u00e9, and unlike many of her opera colleagues, Ms. Fleming has gone about her stage career  \u2014   and, now, her plans for after  \u2014   with unusual deliberation. \u201cRen\u00e9e is not like other singers,\u201d said Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met. \u201cI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s nice. But she\u2019s very calm. Whatever fears or horrors she has are well hidden. \u201d Mr. Epstein recalled a period in the 1990s when Ms. Fleming was making a specialty of \u201cDer Rosenkavalier. \u201d \u201cShe said to me: \u2018I think I\u2019m going to stop now, and this is something I can come back to at the end,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe arc of a career is complicated. It\u2019s hard to start a career, and it\u2019s even harder to end one elegantly. So I think this is a very smart and considered decision on her part. It\u2019s called going out at the top. \u201d Mr. Carsen, who has also directed Ms. Fleming in some of her most acclaimed productions, including Handel\u2019s \u201cAlcina\u201d and Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d said: \u201cRen\u00e9e has been one of the most glamorous and really beautiful singers. A beautiful woman in every respect. It was never in the cards that as the years moved on she was going to start playing people\u2019s mothers. \u201d Ms. Fleming turned 58 in February. Her friend and mentor Leontyne Price was the same age when she retired from the opera stage in 1985, and there is a famous YouTube video of her struggling to keep it together as she receives an endless ovation. It\u2019s hard to believe that Ms. Fleming won\u2019t puddle up a little at her last performance. But in London in January, on the morning after her    \u201cRosenkavalier\u201d at the Royal Opera House, she was anything but nostalgic. Sitting in the kitchen of her flat on one of the city\u2019s most posh streets, she seemed less a forlorn diva than the very organized and energetic, very American chief executive of a small company: Let\u2019s call it Renee Fleming Inc. \u201cMy guide to this whole process, when I was thinking about what to do, was Leontyne Price,\u201d she said in her surprisingly deep speaking voice  \u2014   so low she once saw a speech therapist, fearing it might be bad for her singing. \u201cShe said that her concertizing afterward was when she had the most fun, and she also said something to the effect that she felt she was no longer surrounded by her colleagues. That becomes true very quickly  \u2014   pretty soon your colleagues are of another generation. \u201d Ms. Fleming insisted that she wouldn\u2019t stop singing entirely but that she was just changing her focus. She plans to give more concerts (which, though she didn\u2019t say so, are both easier and far more lucrative than singing staged opera) make more records, find new music to sing, and spend more time at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, where she was named creative consultant in 2010. (Some have speculated that position might be a steppingstone to running an opera company herself.) She said she was even thinking of getting involved in an internet   for streaming arts programs. Some of Ms. Fleming\u2019s fame is a result of arriving at the right moment, when there were still powerful management and record companies to promote her career. Some is a result of calculation and astute  . Following the advice of Ms. Falcone, whom she hired in 1995, she lost weight and started paying more attention to her hair and wardrobe. (Nowadays, according to Ms. Patchett, she dresses up even to go to Kinko\u2019s at 8 in the morning.) But it couldn\u2019t have happened without her voice  \u2014   shimmering and lustrous. Her detractors sometimes claim that Ms. Fleming\u2019s voice is actually too much of a good thing: too lush, too creamy. She has been called the June Cleaver of opera singers  \u2014   too bland, in other words  \u2014   and her voice has been described as Botoxed, so plump and seamless that it lacks dramatic expressiveness. Ms. Fleming\u2019s sound hasn\u2019t darkened with age, as often happens to sopranos. (If it had, she might have ended up with a wider choice of roles in her 50s). She\u2019s not as virtuosic as she once was, but whether you like her voice or not, she still sounds much the way she did 25 years ago. It hasn\u2019t hurt her career that, as Mr. Carsen pointed out, Ms. Fleming is also very beautiful, with a   face, high cheekbones and unusually large eyes, which onstage are as expressive as a silent film star\u2019s: a  \u2019s ideal of what an opera singer should look like. And unlike some earlier divas, for whom the job description seemed to include being as difficult offstage as was humanly possible, she is, for a superstar, almost unnaturally normal and unaffected. She loves to interact with her most devoted fans and even makes a point of remembering their names. Sue Schardt, a friend of hers since college, said Ms. Fleming hasn\u2019t changed much since they shared a dorm room. \u201cRen\u00e9e\u2019s not just humble,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s chronically humble. \u201d Ms. Fleming grew up outside of Rochester, where her parents were both music teachers. She was gifted, but not a prodigy, and there wasn\u2019t enough money to send her to a fancy conservatory like Oberlin College, her first choice. So she enrolled in the Crane School of Music at the State University of New York at Potsdam, where she majored not in performance but in music education, assuming she\u2019d follow in her parents\u2019 footsteps. She has said that back then she had no idea how to sing and sounded like a \u201cbuzzing insect,\u201d which isn\u2019t quite true. Ms. Schardt shared an ancient tape recording of Ms. Fleming singing in the student union, and she sounds not unlike a young Joni Mitchell, her idol at the time. \u201cRen\u00e9e was always doing surprising things,\u201d Ms. Schardt recalled. \u201cSo does it surprise me, the career she has now and what she\u2019s developed into? No. Is it something we were thinking about when we graduated in 1981? No. It all goes back to being a   girl from central New York. At the core, that\u2019s who she is. She\u2019s a working singer, and these are gigs. What grounds her is her friends, her family, her girls. \u201d (Ms. Fleming has two daughters by her first marriage  \u2014   which ended in 1998, around the time she was heckled in Milan  \u2014   and three stepchildren with her second husband, Tim Jessell, a corporate lawyer Ms. Patchett fixed her up with on a blind date.) If Ms. Fleming had a noticeable talent back then, it was for jazz, still one of her great loves. She was good enough that Illinois Jacquet, the jazz saxophonist, urged her to drop out and tour with his group. She declined, she says, because she was too much of a nerd and afraid of that much freedom. Instead she stayed in school and, always an overachiever, kept applying for and winning fellowships: ones from the Eastman School of Music and the Juilliard School, and a Fulbright that took her to Germany. Fortunate in her teachers, among them Beverley Johnson and the imperious Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, she acquired a formidable mastery of the mechanics of singing. Even now, listening to her talk about breath control, tongue tension and laryngeal placement is enough to make you wonder how anyone ever learned to sing at all. But even with all her technique  \u2014   or maybe because of it  \u2014   Ms. Fleming was a late bloomer. She suffered from stage fright, from poor audition choices and from finding a certain psychological comfort in finishing second rather than first place in competitions. For a while, she sang practically anything: for example, 10   roles in a   stretch starting in 1995. But in the period after that, guided by Mr. Epstein and Ms. Falcone, she made the crucial decision to be more selective and focus on parts that particularly suited her voice. As it happened, many of them were roles in which she wouldn\u2019t have to do battle with the looming legacy of Maria Callas and other great divas of the past: Massenet\u2019s Tha\u00efs and Manon Desdemona in Verdi\u2019s \u201cOtello\u201d the title role in Dvorak\u2019s \u201cRusalka\u201d (an opera that was practically   until Ms. Fleming brought it back into the repertory) Tatiana in \u201cEugene Onegin\u201d and the Marschallin. She has been so affecting in these last two that you begin to suspect some deep personal connection to the parts: the shy, spurned lover who never gets over her youthful passion, and the aging mistress. Ms. Fleming has said that it\u2019s unlikely she will ever be poisoned or strangled to death in real life (or become a   mermaid, for that matter) but that \u201cplaying out the Marschallin\u2019s grief, her fears and finally, her heartbreaking dignity  \u2014   those are the moments when I feel most exposed. \u201d If Ms. Fleming has a model besides Leontyne Price, it\u2019s surely Beverly Sills. Her popularity, at its peak even greater than Ms. Fleming\u2019s, was based on the same formula  \u2014   humble roots, hard work, unaffected approachability, the kind of voice you didn\u2019t need to know a thing about opera to love  \u2014   and after her retirement from the stage, she went on to become a hugely influential arts administrator and cultural ambassador. As comfortable sitting on panels as standing onstage, Ms. Fleming has lobbied for arts education in schools and is collaborating with the National Institutes of Health on a project to study the effects of music on the brains of people with autism, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and   stress disorder. Her creative consultancy with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, originally intended as a sort of   experiment that might bring Ms. Fleming to that city more often, has grown into something far deeper. The company\u2019s   2015 premiere production of \u201cBel Canto,\u201d based on Ms. Patchett\u2019s novel, came about mostly through her energy and determination: She proposed the project and then, acting more like an impresario than a diva, lined up all the talent, at one point bringing in a spreadsheet listing some 60 possible composers. (The Peruvian composer Jimmy L\u00f3pez eventually got the nod, and the playwright Nilo Cruz wrote the libretto.) She has worked on audience development efforts and has encouraged the company to leaven its operatic offerings with classic musicals. Every couple of months, she spends a week or so in Chicago, attending meetings and giving master classes. Early in February, she was the host of a   event called Chicago Voices, which included classes for young singers on social media,   and marketing. Ms. Fleming taught a session to a group of aspiring high school students, not just encouraging them but also bending over volunteers and squeezing their backs to improve their breathing. Afterward, she presided over a panel discussion, delving into details about the larynx, the importance of hydration and perhaps more about the vocal mucosa than nonsingers really need to know. A little more than 24 hours later, as if to prove the soundness of her theories and her own breathing apparatus, Ms. Fleming took part in a big concert celebrating Chicago singing in all its variety. She was the only one on the bill without roots in the city, and also  \u2014   because this is what opera stars do  \u2014   the only one to appear in three different outfits. She sang a Debussy art song, a   operatic version of \u201cSummertime,\u201d a Sarah Vaughan jazz tune in a duet with Kurt Elling, and, with John Prine, a gently twanging version of the Nashville song \u201c(We\u2019re Not) the Jet Set. \u201d That Ms. Fleming sang more than any of the other performers doubtless had something to do with the fact that she was the organizer and headliner. But unlike a lot of singers, she also has the range to perform in that many styles. She can sing practically anything, and in about six languages  \u2014   not just opera and art songs, but jazz, pop and standards. Her 2010 rock album, \u201cDark Hope,\u201d including songs by indie bands like Arcade Fire and Death Cab for Cutie, was an experiment that pleased almost no one. The indie crowd resented her poaching on their turf, while Ms. Fleming\u2019s opera fans complained that, singing more huskily and about two octaves lower than usual, she sounded so little like herself that they couldn\u2019t recognize her. But the album has a certain oddball integrity, and, if nothing else, demonstrated Ms. Fleming\u2019s fearlessness. Her very eclectic most recent record, \u201cDistant Light,\u201d which came out in January, includes Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cKnoxville: Summer of 1915,\u201d a lovely old chestnut with a text by James Agee some arty Anders Hillborg settings of poems by Mark Strand, who was a friend of Ms. Fleming\u2019s and three Bj\u00f6rk songs. These last numbers might be thought an odd choice for an opera singer, but Ms. Fleming pointed out that even her mother, the former music teacher, loves Bj\u00f6rk: \u201cShe\u2019s so creative, like Lady Gaga even before Lady Gaga. \u201d Ms. Fleming doesn\u2019t have much interest in becoming a figure like Adelina Patti, the hugely popular   and    opera star who went around, like Cher, giving farewell concerts for 20 years after she \u201cretired. \u201d What she wants is to keep on singing, a reasonable amount for a reasonable amount of time, and to be a part of whatever happens next. While the prognosis is not particularly good for the   landscape she dominated, she sounded determined and upbeat about the future. On several occasions, she has brought up her fascination with \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which she used to watch with her daughter, and said that she wished opera singers were among the contestants. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been left out of the conversation, and we have a lot to offer technically,\u201d she said recently. \u201cI guess it\u2019s the ivory tower and all that, but I\u2019m trying to open the door again. I think my contribution now is to think about audience development, about supporting young artists, and the development of the art form. \u201d She isn\u2019t temperamentally inclined to share her regrets, but on the eve of her farewell she offered a few. \u201cI would have loved to have sung a lot of the heavier repertoire,\u201d she said. \u201cI once had a manager who said \u2018You\u2019re never going to make it otherwise.\u2019 Mim\u00ec, Butterfly, Tosca, Salome, Elektra: It would have been exciting, but it simply wasn\u2019t for my voice. \u201d After pausing a moment, she quickly changed the subject to her work at the Lyric Opera. \u201cThat opportunity came as a shock, sort of, seven years ago, when the last thing I was thinking about was slowing down,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now I feel like I\u2019m doing everything  \u2014   singing, concertizing, touring, creating new work. I just kind of love doing all these different things. Time will tell. I may never choose to focus more. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628567.4816628}
