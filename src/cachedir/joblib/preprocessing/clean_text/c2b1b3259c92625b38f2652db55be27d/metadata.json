The new details indicated that the episode was more serious than the Secret Service had originally stated. A Republican lawmaker said it also suggested the Secret Service\u2019s security measures remain inadequate two and a half years after a series of lapses tarred the agency and led to major upheaval. In a separate episode, officials also reported Friday that a Secret Service laptop was stolen from an agency vehicle in Brooklyn. But the Secret Service said in a statement about the theft that agency laptops are fully encrypted and \u201care not permitted to contain classified information. \u201d The   episode took place on the night of March 10, and President Trump was inside the White House residence at the time. Jonathan   Tran, 26, of Milpitas, Calif. breached the outer perimeter of the White House by the Treasury Department building while carrying a backpack holding two cans of pepper spray, a book by Mr. Trump, a letter to the president and other items, the authorities said. After an officer ultimately detained him, Mr. Tran  \u2014   who appears to have a history of mental illness  \u2014   said, \u201cI am a friend of the president. I have an appointment,\u201d according to a court filing. \u201cSecret Service did a fantastic job last night,\u201d Mr. Trump said the next day. Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote in a letter on Friday to the Secret Service that the committee received \u201cadditional information\u201d about the episode, including indications that Mr. Tran \u201cmay have moved around on the White House grounds undetected for a considerable amount of time. \u201d The Secret Service said in a statement late Friday that Mr. Tran, after climbing several gates as high as eight feet, was inside the grounds for about 17 minutes before he was apprehended at 11:38 p. m. The agency said it is conducting an investigation. CNN first reported on the new details in the case. Mr. Chaffetz also said that the committee had received information indicating that the Secret Service \u201cignored\u201d alarms that Mr. Tran tripped and that he may have attempted to get into the White House itself. \u201cIf true, these allegations raise questions about whether the agency\u2019s security protocols are adequate,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said, stressing \u201clongstanding concerns\u201d about security episodes at facilities protected by the Secret Service. Last week\u2019s   recalled an embarrassing episode for the Secret Service in September 2014, when an intruder with a knife, Omar J. Gonzalez, managed to run through the ceremonial East Room of the White House before he was apprehended. The Secret Service was criticized for playing down the severity of the episode until a fuller account emerged in an investigation by a House subcommittee led by Mr. Chaffetz. That episode, along with a series of other safety lapses revealed at the time, led to intense congressional criticism, a   of the Secret Service\u2019s top management and the addition of spikes atop the White House fencing to deter climbers. Plans were recently approved for a taller, stronger fence. A 2015 report by the House Oversight Committee called the Secret Service \u201can agency in crisis\u201d and found that over a   period, there had been 143 security breaches and attempted security breaches at secured facilities.'"}, "time": 1742562025.8202653}
