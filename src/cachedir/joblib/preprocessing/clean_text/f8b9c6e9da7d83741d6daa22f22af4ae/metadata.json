[The Mirror reports that the robot, known as FEDOR  \u2014   Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research  \u2014   is part of Russias current developments in space exploration. The robot is being developed by Android Technics and the Advanced Research Fund, initially with the aim to aid during rescue operations, however, now the robot is being considered to replace human engineers on the International Space Station.

FEDOR is currently scheduled to travel into space in 2021 and could act as a permanent replacement to the cosmonauts onboard the ISS. \u201cThis thing can work without a space suit, live not only in a crew vehicle, but even outside it. Its name is Fedor. \u201d said Deputy PM Rogozin. Vladimir Solntsev, general director of Russian   corporation Energia, said: \u201cOur involvement in the   space robot project will bring us to the next level in the development of robotic technologies. \u201d Director of the TSNIImash laboratory of space robotic Alexander Grebenshchikov said: \u201cEvery hour of work of cosmonauts on space walks costs from $2 million to $4 million (USD). \u201d \u201cThe use of robots for routine operations in the future will also spare additional time of the crew for leisure or for the fulfillment of other important tasks. \u201d said Grebenshchikov.
