In his ruling, the judge said that Mr. Trump, by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter  \u2014   a process that could take years  \u2014   had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees. Instead, the money was withheld. The decision is the first court judgment against a company owned by Mr. Trump since he became president last month, and underscores that while Mr. Trump has stepped away from the operations of his company, he is certain to remain dogged by legal controversies connected to his business. At his new hotel in Washington, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract. The two men backed out of the Trump International Hotel development in 2015 after Mr. Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Separately, the federal government owns the building that houses the hotel, and some legal experts have said that Mr. Trump may be in violation of his lease, which appears to prohibit federal elected officials from leasing the building. And last month, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan contending that Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include golf courses, commercial real estate and marketing agreements. Rather he has handed the operations of his company over to his eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, a move he hopes will reduce the appearance of conflict of interest. Wednesday\u2019s ruling  \u2014   by Judge Kenneth Marra of Federal District Court in West Palm Beach, an appointee of President George W. Bush\u2019s  \u2014   calls for the club to pay $4. 85 million in withheld fees to 65 club members involved in the lawsuit, plus an additional $925, 000 in interest and other costs. As a result, those members will receive refunds of $35, 000 to $200, 000, depending on their level of membership in the club. Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the company planned to appeal. \u201cAt the time Trump purchased the club, it was suffering financially, making it unlikely that these members would ever get back their deposits,\u201d Ms. Miller said in a statement. \u201cAt trial, we presented overwhelming evidence that the plaintiffs\u2019 memberships were never recalled and that the plaintiffs had waived this argument during the course of the litigation. \u201d The dispute at the Jupiter club centered on contracts signed by club members with the facility\u2019s previous owner,  . To join, members paid initiation fees as high as $210, 000, depending on the type of membership that they wanted. But under  \u2019s rules those deposits were refundable when a member resigned. That process, however, could take years and while members on the resignation list waited for their turn to come up they could still use the club so long as they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums. That all changed in 2012 when the Trump Organization bought the Jupiter club. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump sent a letter to members saying that those who wanted to resign were no longer welcome there. \u201cI do not want them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues,\u201d the letter read. After club members sued, Mr. Trump testified in 2015 during a pretrial deposition that although he had signed the letter, it was his   son, Eric Trump, who was in charge of policies at the family\u2019s golf courses. \u201cEric is much more familiar with this club,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe runs it. \u201d In his pretrial deposition, Eric Trump testified that nothing had changed and that club members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid their dues. That claim, however, was disputed at trial last year. One member on the resignation list, Richard Slawson, testified that the club\u2019s membership manager told him soon after the Trumps took it over that the club was  . But he continued to receive $6, 000 bills for annual dues and thousands in minimum charges for food and beverages that were never consumed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that we were charged that when we were not allowed to use the club,\u201d Mr. Slawson, a Florida lawyer, said in a recent telephone interview. Confronted with such testimony, the younger Mr. Trump during his court testimony backed off his assertions and acknowledged he had been mistaken. \u201cHe made himself our strongest witness,\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Bradley Edwards, said about Eric Trump. \u201cThere was no way to reconcile his prior testimony with his testimony at trial. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563619.1932075}
