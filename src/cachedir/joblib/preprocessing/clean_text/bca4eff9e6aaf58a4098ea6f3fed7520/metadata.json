Whatever we did, it\u2019s getting into people, and they see themselves in it. \u201d Held at Cipriani Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, the   Gothams  \u2014   attendees included Amy Adams, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and a delightfully   Danny DeVito  \u2014   signal the beginning of the movie awards season. The prizes for \u201cMoonlight\u201d  \u2014   it also won best screenplay, best ensemble and the audience award  \u2014   firm up early forecasts that it would be a strong player in the awards race this year. Though the Gothams are not necessarily predictive of the Oscars, its winners for best feature from the previous two years, \u201cBirdman\u201d and \u201cSpotlight,\u201d went on to receive the Academy Award for best picture. Other awardees included Ezra Edelman, who won best documentary for the multipart \u201cO. J.: Made in America,\u201d Casey Affleck, best actor for \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d and Isabelle Huppert for \u201cElle. \u201d (On Tuesday, the competition between \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d was ratcheted up another notch by the National Board of Review. The board named Mr. Jenkins best director of the year, but named \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d the year\u2019s best film, and Mr. Affleck best actor. Best actress went to Amy Adams, for her star turn in \u201cArrival. \u201d Mr. Edelman collected the best documentary award again, while Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote and directed \u201cManchester,\u201d won for best original screenplay. The rather mysterious board  \u2014   which describes itself as a \u201cselect group of film enthusiasts, filmmakers, professionals, academics and students of varying ages and backgrounds\u201d  \u2014   will hold its awards ceremony in Manhattan on Jan. 4.) At the Gothams on Monday night, Mr. Affleck, who is famously fame averse, said while clutching his award onstage, \u201cIt feels really good, I got to say. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d care this much. \u201d A clearly shocked Ms. Huppert said, \u201cI\u2019m stunned I\u2019m breathless,\u201d as the room cheered. \u201cThey told me it\u2019s a very American award. A very New Yorker award. And \u2018You are French, so you probably won\u2019t get it. \u2019\u201d Not surprisingly, given the crowd and the host,   Key, the evening was heavily laced with references  \u2014   overt, sly, heartfelt and arch  \u2014   to   Donald J. Trump. \u201cHere\u2019s some silver lining: Thank God he isn\u2019t going to live here,\u201d Mr. Key said in his introduction. Oliver Stone, who collected a tribute award, urged    filmmakers to risk being critical of their government if they saw fit. \u201cDon\u2019t go easy on what you think is wrong,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cThe surveillance state, \u20181984,\u2019 cyberwarfare, drone warfare, is with us. This is a major, major issue of our time. I hope you young people will address it. \u201d After Mr. Stone returned to his seat, Mr. Key jokingly pitched him film ideas from the stage. \u201cHow about \u2018JFKKK\u2019?\u201d Mr. Key asked. \u201cNo? What about \u2018Wall Tweet\u2019?\u201d Later, presenting the audience award, the actor Damian Lewis noted how the voting process worked. \u201cThis is the best part,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cThe film that receives the most votes is the winner. It\u2019s a brilliant idea. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562550.0803635}
