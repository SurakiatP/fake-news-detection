While she slept, forgetting about everything that came against her on Friday when the FBI decided to re-investigate her emails and private server, someone else was taking full advantage of the situation and exposing the truth about her as two posts showed. \\nAfter Barack Obama gave control of the Internet to International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Hillary may have thought that her secrets would be safe. As WikiLeaks continues to prove, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Clever conservative web users are alive and well, working hard to expose the secrets that she\u2019s enjoyed keeping behind closed doors before the Internet came along and swung them wide open, exposing the scandalous and criminal behavior that she almost got away with. \\nSince Google tends to lean left and caters to liberal agendas, it\u2019s not often that the search results you\u2019re looking for are all that accurate. However, on Sunday, almost 36 hours after news broke about the FBI investigating Hillary, if you were to search two separate terms, the results were awesomely accurate. \\nA tricky hacker managed to mess with the algorithm so that if anyone was looking for the definition of \u201cpathological liar\u201d on the popular search engine, the top result showed Hillary\u2019s headshot alongside the description, but that wasn\u2019t all. @triplejHack What in the Wide World of Sports is going on with Google!? pic.twitter.com/PJHC23CzDK \\n\u2014 Dilo on Fire (@FireDilo) October 31, 2016 \\nThe definition of this term said, \u201cIt is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and historic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.\u201d While that description may always come up in Google for \u201cPathological liar,\u201d Hillary\u2019s picture isn\u2019t typically there, but it is the perfect example of the mental illness. \\nAdding to the insult was another search result the hacker altered for better accuracy. When searching for who the \u201c45th President\u201d is, Donald Trump\u2019s picture showed up, which Hillary probably wasn\u2019t too happy about. The comparison between the two searches perfectly represents both presidential candidates. With any luck, the results will stay the same after November 8 and the treatment for Hillary\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cpathological liar\u201d will be prison time.'"}, "time": 1742561708.1955562}
