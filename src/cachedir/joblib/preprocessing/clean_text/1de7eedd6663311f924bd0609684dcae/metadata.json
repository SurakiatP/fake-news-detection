Guilty as Sin is available in bookstores and for order from Amazon. \\nJames Comey\u2019s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI, including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. \\n\u2018The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\u2019t recommend an indictment against Hillary,\u2019 said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \\n\u2018Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\u2019 said the source. \u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\u2019 \\nAccording to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. \\nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom \\n\u2018He\u2019s been ignoring the resignation letters in the hope that he could find a way of remedying the situation,\u2019 said the source. \\n\u2018When new emails that appeared to be related to Hillary\u2019s personal email server turned up in a computer used [her close aide] Huma Abedin and [Abedin\u2019s disgraced husband,] Anthony Weiner, Comey jumped at the excuse to reopen the investigation. \\n\u2018The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,\u2019 the source continued. \u2018And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. \\n\u2018He talks about the damage that he\u2019s done to himself and the institution [of the FBI], and how he\u2019s been shunned by the men and women who he admires and work for him. It\u2019s taken a tremendous toll on him. \\n\u2018It shattered his ego. He looks like he\u2019s aged 10 years in the past four months.\u2019 \\nBut Comey\u2019s decision to reopen the case was more than an effort to heal the wound he inflicted on the FBI. \\nHe was also worried that after the presidential election, Republicans in Congress would mount a probe of how he had granted Hillary political favoritism. \\nHis announcement about the revived investigation, which came just 11 days before the presidential election, was greeted with shock and dismay by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the prosecutors at the Justice Department. \\n\u2018Jim told me that Lynch and Obama are furious with him,\u2019 the source said. \\nAs I revealed in my latest New York Times bestseller Guilty As Sin Obama said that appointing Comey as FBI direct was \u2018my worst mistake as president.\u2019 \\n\u2018Lynch and Obama haven\u2019t contacted Jim directly,\u2019 said the source, \u2018but they\u2019ve made it crystal clear through third parties that they disapprove of his effort to save face.\u2019'"}, "time": 1742628514.3034916}
