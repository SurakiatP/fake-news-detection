[In the latest political PSA from   comedy website Funny or Die released this week, a number of celebrities  \u2014   including Shailene Woodley, Cara Delevingne, Jamie Chung and others  \u2014   lay out the case for why they believe Trump is relying on an old \u201calternate\u201d Constitution found in a musty old cave.   \u201cWe only know of two copies [of the alternative Constitution] one of which archaeologists found cradled in the mouth of a large golden   deity hidden in a deep underground cave,\u201d explains West Wing star Hill. \u201cTrump was accidentally given the other copy when he was a teen. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s working from the wrong Constitution and he doesn\u2019t even know it,\u201d says Delevingne. In the supposed \u201calternative\u201d Constitution from which Trump is working appears the clause: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, but if a handsome, brave, scared president makes an executive order that favors one religion over another, he shall only experience pure ecstasy. \u201d The PSA marks the latest   entry from Funny or Die after the Will Ferrell and Adam   comedy website became nearly the premiere destination for such videos during the election.   offerings from the website included Tom Green\u2019s parody music video \u201cDo the Donald\u201d and Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cVote Naked\u201d political PSA. Last year, the site released a   \u201clost\u201d made for TV movie based on Trump\u2019s bestselling book The Art of the Deal, with Johnny Depp starring as Trump.
