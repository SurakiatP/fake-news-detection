Within minutes, his campaign was claiming it was a Hillary supporter with a gun trying to kill their candidate. \\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s social media director spinning the tale: Trump social media director retweeted a tweet claiming this was an assassination attempt pic.twitter.com/TTUCH4Zbb8 \\n\u2014 Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) November 6, 2016 \\nDonald Trump Jr. followed suit, telling his followers on Twitter that his father had almost been assassinated. He offered zero evidence. \\nAnd, in fact, absolutely none of those details were true. The protester which is believed to have incited the panic was not trying to harm Donald Trump, not carrying a gun, and wasn\u2019t even a Hillary supporter . He was a Republican protesting Trump. \\nReporters tracked down the man, who says he was holding a sign and was attacked by Trump supporters after someone said he had a gun. This is the man who was ejected from the rally, sparking panic. He was holding a sign: \"Republicans Against Trump\" pic.twitter.com/bZ2JAZ2w88 \\n\u2014 Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) November 6, 2016 He says he\\'s a Republican. He said he was terrified by how the crowd responded: \"I was in survival mode. I knew I could die at that moment.\" \\n\u2014 Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) November 6, 2016 \\nThe Secret Service clarified what happened, and while their actions were understandable given the circumstances, the idea that the Trump campaign could leap from the small amount of details to a full-blown Hillary conspiracy is idiotic and reckless.

This rush to exploit a non-story by Trump\u2019s campaign is cynical and disturbing. It also led to Trump\u2019s fired up mob seeking to avenge their candidate by attacking reporters \u2013 a group Trump has repeatedly demonized. 4: Clinton supporter. When a CNN reporter went into the crowd to try to learn more he was assaulted by feral Trumpers still amped up \u2026 \\n\u2014 Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) November 6, 2016 \\nThere is something cultish about the way Trump\u2019s campaign relished the idea that someone would attempt to hurt their candidate. The minor detail that none of it was true didn\u2019t seem to slow them down. They want to portray Trump as a martyr without any of the inconvenience of an actual martyrdom. \\nFeatured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742564622.1677198}
