Hannity argued Republicans must make sure this doesn\u2019t happen in the future and point to the flaws in the legislative process where improvement must be made. However, he emphasized the outcome was not the fault of President Donald Trump. \u201cLet me be very clear here,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cThis is not President Trump\u2019s failure. President Trump went above and beyond and did everything in his power to get this bill across the finish line. \u201d Hannity went on to take aim at the media and the Democratic opposition to the bill but reiterated that measures should be taken to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again.
