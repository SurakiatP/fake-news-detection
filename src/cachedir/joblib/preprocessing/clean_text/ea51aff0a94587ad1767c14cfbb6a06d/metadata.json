The two of us were sitting in a quiet space on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where we had planned to spend the night in tents camping out. \u201cThe key thing to consider is that I am not a very good businessman,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not really anything but a guy who was addicted to internet porn. \u201d A few years ago, Mr. Rhodes, 26, founded a website as an online space meant to help others who share his particular problem. It has about one million unique visitors each month, he said, and nearly breaks even. Mr. Rhodes, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and worked at Google until recently, is now hoping to make his site into something larger. With the help of his father and other family members, he is transforming part of an abandoned church into a base of operations for his fledgling company. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to look back and regret what happened in terms of growing up, being addicted to internet porn,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might look back and be like: \u2018Oh, man. I was a loser. And if I never watched it, my life would be so much better.\u2019 And maybe that\u2019s true. But at the same time, the fact that I was addicted to internet porn, the fact that I was so mediocre, makes me uniquely qualified to help humanity. \u201d In recent years, Mr. Rhodes has emerged as a spokesman against a \u201cdisease\u201d that hasn\u2019t been officially recognized by the medical establishment. He seemed uneasy with his new status. He was careful with every word and asked to go off the record more than a government official. He would not confirm whether he was involved with someone, saying only that, since giving up pornography \u201cfor good\u201d in 2013, he has been able to have meaningful relationships with women. In some ways, his story is that of the digital age. His father was a computer programmer, and he was exposed to digital technology from early on. He gravitated to Nintendo Game Boy and eventually moved to the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation. At 11 or so, he said, he clicked on a banner ad by mistake and found an image depicting rape. By the time he had reached adolescence, so had the internet, and Mr. Rhodes came to rely on   pornography that was easy to find and often free. By college, he was masturbating while watching it up to 14 times a day, he said. \u201cI would say, \u2018O. K. I have to take a few days to recover from this, like physically recover,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t last for even a day. \u201d Mr. Rhodes\u2019s seeming dependence on porn didn\u2019t help matters with his first girlfriend, whom he started dating when he was a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh. It was his first real chance for sustained intimacy, and he blew it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was all due to internet porn,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you that the sex life didn\u2019t go very well. I had   erectile dysfunction  \u2014   a very mild form, and this is all very   because doctors won\u2019t diagnose this  \u2014   but I was able to maintain an erection by fantasizing about pornography. That was the only way. \u201d In 2011, Mr. Rhodes was lost and in search of support. He created a discussion forum on Reddit on the topic of abstaining from masturbation and pornography. He realized he was far from alone and began his   site soon after. After college, he continued to build the site while working as a contractor for Google, specializing in data analysis. He said he earned good money and was able to put a good amount into the website (called NoFap. com, from a slang term for masturbation). But he was still using the supposed vice he was railing against. It took another failed relationship to get him to quit. \u201cI think I was relying on pornography as some kind of emotional crutch,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything bad would happen, you would go to porn, because it would always be there. \u201cI knew it was bad for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also realized it was bad for women I was involved with, and that was the moment that I said: \u2018I need to leave this thing behind. It is completely distorting my sexuality to the point where it could actually be harmful or at least not enjoyable for other people who I am involved with. \u2019\u201d Mr. Rhodes came to believe he had a calling greater than his work in data analysis at Google. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision,\u201d he said of his leaving the job last year. \u201cBut ultimately it was what was best for humanity. \u201d The website serves as an online umbrella for men looking to escape pornography. It has advertisements for   software and online programs that promote the idea of steering clear of pornography and masturbation. The site also has discussion forums and includes testimonials by men sharing stories of their successes and failures. And it helps match men with \u201caccountability partners\u201d meant to serve as Alcoholics   sponsors, to keep a person on the right path. The site generates revenue through subscriptions and advertising, Mr. Rhodes said. To make it into something more robust, Mr. Rhodes needed to \u201ccome out\u201d as a spokesman of sorts. After he appeared in a New York magazine article in 2013 about men who had quit masturbating, he told his mother what was going on, much to her horror. Other interviews followed. While his family remains supportive, there are limits. When he showed his mother a recent article in Time magazine in which he was quoted, she said, joking, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be reading these types of things about my son,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, recalling his mother\u2019s reaction. On the first day I visited Mr. Rhodes, we climbed the stairs of the former St. Clement Church in Tarentum, Pa. The structure, built in 1906, had long since been abandoned, its pews, confessional and attached school crumbling and gathering dust. His father, Phillip Rhodes, had recently bought the sprawling complex at auction for $50, 000. While the church is likely to house other businesses, the younger Mr. Rhodes sees a future there for him and a fully staffed operation. He sat on one side of the church confessional while I sat on the other. \u201cTell me the last time you watched porn,\u201d I said, joking. Despite the location, he has largely kept away from religious people, especially evangelicals wanting to team up with him, even though such a relationship could help fund his work. \u201cI have viewpoints that don\u2019t mesh with their viewpoints,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cI\u2019m very  . I\u2019m not a religious person. I\u2019m not someone who supports religion. I\u2019m not against religion, but I don\u2019t support it. And I completely, firmly believe in premarital sex. \u201d Mr. Rhodes said he has also endured the wrath of those on the other end of the ideological spectrum. People have tried  \u2014   and failed  \u2014   to hack the site\u2019s servers, and its forums have been bombarded with pornographic images, he said. His father received pornography in the mail, Mr. Rhodes said, and he himself has gotten death threats. \u201cIt\u2019s just something you have to deal with and let the proper authorities follow up on anything,\u201d he said. Soon it would grow terribly cold, making for a terrible night of sleep in spite of a tent and a supposedly insulated sleeping bag that I bought at a suburban Target. On the morning of our second day, Mr. Rhodes sat near the extinguished campfire from the night before, laptop on his knees. Soon we\u2019d be departing the campsite, heading back to the city, to \u201ccivilization. \u201d But first he had to present a webinar for another   outfit. During the chat, he spoke with people who asked about avoiding triggers. As the session continued, he spoke less about pornography than about the need to take care of oneself, both physically and emotionally. He talked about developing good habits and routines, about changing one\u2019s life in general. When a health care worker asked about fatigue and how he believed it often led him to pornography, Mr. Rhodes told the man that he needed to take care of his own health as well. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you\u2019re on an airplane flight,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cand they say, \u2018Oh, you have to put your oxygen mask on before assisting others with theirs.\u2019 It\u2019s because you\u2019ll pass out trying to get a mask on to somebody else. You have to make sure you\u2019re in a balanced spot in order to best serve other people, in order to best serve the world. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564486.5650437}
