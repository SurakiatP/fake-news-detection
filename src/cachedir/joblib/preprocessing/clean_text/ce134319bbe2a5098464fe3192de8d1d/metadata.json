In 2010, while looking for a wanted man, Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies did not have a warrant when they illegally searched a house and a small shack behind it. Two deputies entered the shack without knocking or announcing themselves, saw what they said was a man holding a rifle  \u2014   it turned out to be a BB gun  \u2014   and opened fire. They wounded the man and his pregnant girlfriend, neither of whom was the person they were looking for. Angel Mendez, who lost his right leg below the knee in the shooting and lived in the shack with Jennifer Lynn Garcia, sued the county in federal court and won $4 million in damages. The county appealed. The legal question in the case, County of Los Angeles v. Mendez, is not about the shooting itself the courts have agreed that at the moment they pulled their triggers, the deputies could have reasonably believed they were in danger. Instead, the argument has turned on whether the warrantless search, a violation of constitutional rights, was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d that made the deputies liable for the shooting, or if it was merely a contributing factor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me a fluky or random thing to say, when there\u2019s an unauthorized entry into someone\u2019s home, violence may result,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said. She likened an officer without a warrant to a trespasser, who would meet a very different response than would a guest. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. disagreed strongly. \u201cIf you take away the failure to get a warrant, the harm still occurs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe search warrant is not going to change the conduct. \u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy voiced seemingly conflicting views. Without liability, \u201cwe simply have no way to enforce the warrant requirement,\u201d he said. But calling the lack of a warrant the proximate cause of the shooting, he said, is \u201ca difficult position to defend. \u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against Los Angeles County partly based on a theory that officers who recklessly provoke a confrontation can be liable for the results. Legal analysts expect that reasoning, which other appellate courts have not adopted, to be addressed in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. But it was barely discussed on Wednesday. The deputies\u2019 failure to warn before entering the shack could be deemed improper, and was more directly linked to the shooting. But the Ninth Circuit ruled that it was not clear in 2010 that the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule the courts have espoused would apply to a building like a shack. Using that rule to support the plaintiffs, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said, \u201cYou end up imposing liability for what is arguably a violation of best police practices. \u201d But Justice Stephen G. Breyer questioned the need to break the incident down moment by moment to find liability. \u201cThe background circumstances can be such that there is no justification for the whole ball of wax,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562032.826245}
