Team leaders continued to say that the 10 players, whose suspensions remain in effect, were being punished without the benefit of due process. Minnesota will meet Washington State in the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 27 in San Diego, avoiding what would have been the first time a   college football team had missed a game because of a player protest in at least decades. Team leaders gathered Saturday morning at a hastily arranged news conference in a team meeting room in the Bierman Field Athletic Building on campus to announce the decision, which came after a lengthy meeting on Friday night of team leaders with the university\u2019s president, Eric W. Kaler, and Athletic Director Mark Coyle. Wide receiver Drew Wolitarsky, a senior, read a statement from the team, saying, \u201cAfter many hours of discussion within our team, and after speaking with President Kaler, it became clear that our original request of having the 10 suspensions overturned was not going to happen. \u201d The statement continued, \u201cWe as a team will use our status as public figures to bring more exposure to the issue of sexual harassment and violence against women. \u201d The statement added that \u201csexual harassment and violence against women have no place on this campus, on our team, in society. \u201d The statement also said that the players had secured a promise that the suspended players would eventually be given a \u201cfair hearing  \u2014   which includes a diverse review panel. \u201d Though the university\u2019s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action concluded last week that the 10 players had violated the university\u2019s code of conduct  \u2014   with four committing sexual assault according to the university\u2019s rules, which require affirmative consent  \u2014   sanctions have yet to be determined. Kaler said those hearings would most likely be in January and could not be scheduled before the bowl game because of final exams. He had clarified in a statement Friday night that the suspensions, which were announced Tuesday, were an athletics department decision, separate from whatever consequences might stem from the university\u2019s finding. Kaler had seemed to put the ball in the players\u2019 court Friday night when he pledged in that statement not to \u201cchange our values or our code of conduct for the sake of a bowl game. \u201d On Saturday, Kaler said that his subsequent meeting with team leaders \u201cwas a very frank and candid conversation, and I\u2019m glad it led to this resolution. \u201d The team\u2019s threatened boycott highlighted the significant voice that ostensibly amateur athletes in   sports in prominent conferences (Minnesota is a member of the Big Ten) have, by virtue of their popularity and impact on the athletics department\u2019s bottom line. The episode also touched on a debate embroiling campuses nationwide over how universities must balance their legal obligation to investigate sexual assault with their need to be fair to all students, including those accused of sexual assault. It also displayed the quandary in which administrations find themselves given federal privacy laws. The players\u2019 statement acknowledged as much, saying: \u201cWe also understand that they have requirements that they need to follow about sharing information. Yet at the same time, we observed how our teammates\u2019 names and pictures were shared with the world, and reputations ruined. \u201d After a woman accused several men of sexual assault in September, a criminal investigation led to no prosecutions and a restraining order was dropped as part of a settlement, while four players served   suspensions. The accused have insisted that there was only consensual sex. But the   investigation, whose conclusions were obtained by a Minneapolis television station, used the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard of proof rather than the criminal justice system\u2019s higher standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt. \u201d Coach Tracy Claeys, who led the Golden Gophers to an   record in his first full season in the job, had backed the players\u2019 protest on Twitter. He and several assistants reportedly sat in the back of the room while Wolitarsky read the statement. The investigation report, which relied on interviews, video and other documentation, contained graphic details about what happened the night of the episode. It also stated that a Gophers football recruit had been there he was underage, according to court records. Kaler said Saturday that \u201cthe football team action was in support of their teammates. \u201d \u201cIt was not in support of sexual violence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe players are clear about their involvement in preventing sexual violence. Their values are in support of the victims of sexual violence. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563944.0553718}
