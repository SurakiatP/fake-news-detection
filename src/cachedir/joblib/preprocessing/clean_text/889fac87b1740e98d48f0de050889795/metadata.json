To his right, Jamie Dantzscher started crying during her testimony. She described how she was molested by the former U. S. A. Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar when she was a teenager. Dantzscher, 34 and a former Olympian, said Nassar abused her \u201call over the world. \u201d \u201cIn my own room, in my own bed, in my hotel room in Sydney at the Olympic Games,\u201d she said, through tears. \u201cI thought I was the only one. \u201d To Adams\u2019s left, Jessica Howard, a former national champion in rhythmic gymnastics, testified that Nassar began assaulting her when she was 15, during what he called therapy for a hip injury. \u201cHe began to massage my legs, and then quickly moved inwards on my thighs,\u201d she said. \u201cHe then massaged his way into me. \u201d Give these women credit for telling their stories. They\u2019re a main reason Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, decided to introduce a bill that would make it mandatory for national governing bodies of Olympic sports to report sexual assault to the police. It would be a federal crime not to report abuse. Give Adams credit, too. In the past, the Olympic committee had failed to prioritize the issue of sexual assault and appeared to turn a blind eye to the issue by handing it off to the governing bodies of each Olympic sport. But on Tuesday, finally, Adams said something that was a long time coming. He said sorry. \u201cThe Olympic community failed the people it was supposed to protect,\u201d said Adams, the head of organizational development for the national governing sports bodies, which exist under the umbrella of the United States Olympic Committee. \u201cWe do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse. \u201d Nassar was fired by U. S. A. Gymnastics in 2015 and is currently in jail in Michigan, where he is facing multiple sexual assault charges and federal child pornography charges. He has denied any wrongdoing. You would think U. S. A. Gymnastics would also go out of its way to apologize for its role in a scandal that has shaken Olympic sports and caused the ouster of its president, Steve Penny. More than 80 athletes have accused Nassar of abusing them. But the gymnastics organization did not even have a representative in that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room. Feinstein had asked U. S. A. Gymnastics to testify, and said its board chairman, Paul Parilla, was thinking about it but backed out. Instead, Parilla provided a statement. It said that the board of directors offered \u201cour sincere and heartfelt regrets and sympathies\u201d to any athlete harmed and that U. S. A. Gymnastics was \u201cappalled that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in the manner alleged. \u201d No apologies. Court documents released this month showed U. S. A. Gymnastics had complaint files on 54 coaches regarding sex abuse claims from 1996 to 2006. No apologies, even for its lack of a backbone and for sending only a lobbyist to the hearing. That lobbyist first identified himself as working for U. S. A. Gymnastics  \u2014   which I figured, considering he was holding a file folder that said, \u201cUSAG 50 copies\u201d on it. A few minutes later, he said, no, he was actually there for U. S. A. Hockey. The federation has had no shame, either. When the sex abuse bill was introduced, Penny and others from U. S. A. Gymnastics met with Feinstein about the federation\u2019s sexual assault policies. How about this for a   stunt: Tagging along was Mary Lou Retton, the smiling, bubbly sweetheart from the 1984 Games, as they said that the federation\u2019s policies were solid and that gymnastics was a happy, safe place. On Tuesday, Feinstein and her fellow senators weren\u2019t thrilled that the gymnastics federation had ditched them this time. \u201cIf they really cared, they would be here,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said as he looked at Dantzscher and Howard, the abused gymnasts who testified. \u201cThey have to answer for what happened to you. \u201d At a news conference later, Blumenthal called for an investigation into \u201cwho knew what and when. \u201d Feinstein said she would like to see the gymnastics board of directors change and for its replacement to be people who make the sexual assault issue a priority. The U. S. O. C. should hasten that change. It can do so by decertifying U. S. A. Gymnastics, which would basically kick the federation out as the national governing body for the sport of gymnastics in the United States. To let U. S. A. Gymnastics back into the family, the Olympic committee could demand that the federation clean house and start new with fresh faces. The committee has used this power with other federations, and it used its influence to push out Penny when the Nassar case exploded into one of the biggest abuse scandals in sports history. It might as well go a step further, if only to show athletes and other federations that it won\u2019t tolerate sexual abuse on its watch. When asked if U. S. A. Gymnastics knew about the abuse of gymnasts at the hands of Nassar, Feinstein said: \u201cDo I believe they knew about it? Absolutely, yes, I do. \u201d But they didn\u2019t report it, she said, and that\u2019s the culture of the sport. If Feinstein\u2019s bill passes, it would help change that culture. The new U. S. Center for SafeSport  \u2014   a nonprofit formed to prevent and handle abuse in Olympic sports  \u2014   should help, too, if it ever gets going the way it should. Last week, after many delays, including a struggle by the Olympic committee to find funding, the center finally opened for business. There should be a hotline for athletes and others to anonymously report abuse in Olympic sports. Good luck finding it on the center\u2019s website. Feinstein said the Olympic committee should easily find money to fund the site and keep it running, whether it\u2019s through raising money from the private sector or using its own cash. \u201cThe Olympic committee has money, so they can use it the way they want to use it,\u201d she said. Mattie Larson was sitting in the public seats at the hearing on Tuesday. She is 24 now, but I first met Larson, a senior at U. C. L. A. when she was 15, sometime before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She was quiet, and a rising star. She said she was being molested by Nassar around that time. So many years later, in 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published an article about a gymnast who accused Nassar of abusing her, Larson\u2019s former teammate on the national team called her and said, \u201cRead the story and tell me what you think. \u201d The two said they realized that Nassar had abused them. It had never occurred to them that his   \u201cintravaginal treatment\u201d was sexual assault. After all, he was the head doctor for U. S. A. Gymnastics. If the federation trusted him, they should, too. Now Larson replays the abuse in her head, again and again. What could she have done to stop it? What should U. S. A. Gymnastics have done to stop it? \u201cI\u2019m mad at myself for not knowing,\u201d she said of the abuse. \u201cOn so many levels, it was complete betrayal. \u201cYou\u2019d think in a sport with young girls, with young girls wearing leotards, prancing around with their legs flying all over the place, that U. S. A. Gymnastics would educate gymnasts and coaches and parents about sexual abuse. But they didn\u2019t. And they knew they should have. \u201d Larson said it could have saved her and others, countless others, if the U. S. Center for SafeSport had existed when she was competing. \u201cThere are so many more victims who haven\u2019t come forward yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI know them. They\u2019re national team members, Olympians. \u201d At the very least, U. S. A. Gymnastics or the United States Olympic Committee could have mandated sexual abuse awareness training for athletes and their parents. The committee didn\u2019t require its national governing bodies to run abuse education programs, or even conduct criminal background checks, until 2014. When Adams was asked why so many years had passed with no independent entity like the SafeSport center, his answer was vague. \u201cIt took too long to happen,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561704.8888268}
