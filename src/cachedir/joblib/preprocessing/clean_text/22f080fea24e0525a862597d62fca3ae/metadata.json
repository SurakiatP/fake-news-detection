That was the news reported by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend after tabulating the latest donation disclosures through August. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters trumpeted, excuse the pun, the lack of donations from the nation\u2019s largest companies as a badge of honor. Big business, they say, has failed the country, so why would their guy want its support? But the logic of this argument is backward. Mr. Trump has campaigned as a successful businessman, a brilliant negotiator and someone, as he said in his own words, who can \u201cget along with people. \u201d He has contended that his economic policies will unleash   levels of growth  \u2014   as much as 6 percent. He plans to lower corporate taxes, remove regulations and allow companies to repatriate cash held overseas. Together, these policies sound like a C. E. O. \u2019s dream. And yet here we are: Many of the most successful business people in the country refuse to support him  \u2014   or do business with him, either. This is not an opinion. In case there is any doubt, here is a list of companies that in the last two years have publicly severed or reduced business relationships with Mr. Trump, mostly over his inflammatory rhetoric: Macy\u2019s, Univision, Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, Serta, Disney\u2019s ESPN, the PGA Tour, Nascar and Perfumania. Those companies, which have customer bases that include broad swaths of the nation that ostensibly look like the electorate, all said some variation of what Macy\u2019s said: \u201cIn light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy\u2019s values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump. \u201d As this column has noted previously, virtually no big United States banking institution has done new business with Mr. Trump in years, in part because of his history of bankruptcies and his penchant for litigation. During orientation for new employees, Goldman Sachs specifically used to use Mr. Trump as an example of the kind of prospective client to avoid. Still, based on Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, you would think that companies like Apple or Nike, which have railed for lower taxes and are pining to bring tens of billions dollars stashed abroad back to the United States, would be kneeling at the altar of Mr. Trump. (Apple\u2019s and Nike\u2019s chief executives have contributed to Mrs. Clinton.) Granted, there are his views on immigration and trade, which aren\u2019t in sync with United States multinational companies that manufacture products abroad. But then again, Mrs. Clinton opposes the   Partnership too, so that doesn\u2019t provide much of a choice. Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, who employed Mr. Trump on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d when G. E. owned NBC, was asked by Vanity Fair about him over the summer. \u201cThe Donald Trump that I had a chance to work with, I found to be fun to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe words? I can\u2019t reconcile with anything I believe in, or that I think the country stands for or that the company stands for. \u201d By the way, this was Mr. Trump\u2019s reply last year to businesses that stopped doing business with him: \u201cMacy\u2019s, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. \u201d (I should note here that I   \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on CNBC, which is a unit of NBCUniversal.) In fairness, it is worth pointing out that only 11 C. E. O.s of the Fortune 100 donated to Hillary Clinton, according to The Journal. Mr. Trump does have support from some businessmen like Jack Welch, Carl C. Icahn and Wilbur Ross, among others. But for a group that has historically leaned Republican, the absence of contributions is   particularly since at least 19 of them gave to the other Republican candidates in the primaries. There is a good reason, wholly unrelated to political correctness, that the business community has not rallied around Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans. On its merits, that plan is expected to hurt the economy, according to nonpartisan economists. It is hard to find many serious economists, except a handful mostly advising his campaign, who say otherwise. According to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan think tank that includes a list of luminaries from both sides of the aisle, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plan would add $5. 3 trillion to our national debt. That compares with $200 billion as a result of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan. \u201cBoth Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law \u2014   though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more, and Clinton\u2019s plan would slightly reduce deficits if we incorporated unspecified revenue from business tax reform,\u201d the committee wrote. None of this column is meant to suggest that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic plan will usher in a new age of stupendous growth. It won\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t fully address the need for corporate tax reform, and it won\u2019t bring many companies out from under the regulatory morass that they suffer. It won\u2019t bring trillions of dollars back from abroad. Her plan is unlikely to pump up the economy much compared with the path that we are currently on. It is very possible some of her policy measures could even slow the economy. And finally  \u2014   again  \u2014   there is the issue of trade. A centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda is renegotiating many of the country\u2019s trade agreements. In a new report published by his campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers suggest he would threaten, for example, to leave the World Trade Organization to get a better deal. \u201cWithout the U. S. as a member, there would not be much purpose to the W. T. O. ,\u201d the advisers wrote. There is no question that the country would be improved by better trade pacts, but Mr. Trump\u2019s risky approach could start a trade war that could be disastrous for the country\u2019s largest companies. And the uncertainty of the negotiations themselves could slow the economy and rattle our foreign neighbors just look at the resignation of Mexico\u2019s minister of finance for helping bring Mr. Trump there to    with the Mexican president. Other countries will want to avoid similar situations in which they could look like they are caving in to Mr. Trump. (By the way, for those who say, \u201cWho cares about what happens to big businesses that outsource anyway?\u201d think about all the money in all those 401( k) plans that is invested in them.) The Trump economic report cites the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing big business, and its complaints about regulatory burdens. The suggestion is that big business will back Mr. Trump, since he plans to reduce regulation. Yet it is hardly clear the Business Roundtable supports him. The organization has not endorsed either candidate, and its chief executive, John Engler, told The New York Times over the summer: \u201cWe\u2019re just on the opposite side of Trump on trade and immigration. \u201d Mr. Trump, the   great negotiator, may brush aside the views of the country\u2019s leading business executives  \u2014   but perhaps that is because he hasn\u2019t been able to strike a deal with them.'"}, "time": 1742563194.6767285}
