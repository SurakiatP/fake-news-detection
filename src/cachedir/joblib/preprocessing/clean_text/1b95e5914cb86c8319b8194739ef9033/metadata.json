Mr. Obama said the mass shooting in Orlando  \u2014   which he will visit on Thursday to pay his respects to victims\u2019 families, the White House announced on Monday night  \u2014   was being investigated as an act of terrorism. The president said the attack on Sunday by Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded more than 50, was similar to last year\u2019s rampage in San Bernardino, Calif. in which the perpetrators claimed allegiance to the Islamic State beforehand but had no direct connection to it. The president said of Mr. Mateen that \u201cwe see no clear evidence that he was directed externally\u201d by the Islamic State, although he declared fealty to the group \u201cat the last minute. \u201d Still, Mr. Obama said the attack underscored the Islamic State\u2019s power to inspire hateful acts. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges we are going to have is this kind of propaganda and perversions of Islam that you see generated on the internet, and the capacity for that to seep into the minds of troubled individuals, or weak individuals, and seeing them motivated then to take actions against people here in the United States and elsewhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Law enforcement officials were scrutinizing the material Mr. Mateen had come across online to better understand his path to murder, the president said. Mr. Obama, anguished by the latest mass shooting during his tenure  \u2014   a period in which Congress has rejected calls to enact tougher gun rules  \u2014   said the Orlando massacre should prompt Americans to \u201cthink about the risks that we are willing to take by being so lax in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country. \u201d \u201cWe make it very easy for individuals who are troubled, or disturbed, or want to engage in violent acts to obtain very powerful weapons very easily, and it\u2019s a problem,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He noted that it appeared Mr. Mateen had carried out the rampage with guns obtained legally, including an assault rifle he took out of the store the day it was purchased. But the attack highlighted how the politics of gun control has thwarted the president\u2019s determination to enact stricter measures. The White House said Mr. Obama would be a \u201cforceful advocate\u201d for Congress to tighten gun restrictions. He supports legislation to bar firearms sales to people placed on \u201c \u201d lists because of suspected terrorism links and to require background checks for purchases at gun shows. But his aides strongly suggested that the president was out of options to impose additional limits on his own. \u201cThe president is quite intensely frustrated that we haven\u2019t seen the kind of congressional action that we know would have an impact\u201d on mass shootings, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cThe responsibility right now lies with Congress. \u201d Mr. Obama also said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has faced some criticism for failing to stop the attack even though Mr. Mateen had been investigated in recent years for potential links to terrorist groups, had acted appropriately. The White House declined to respond to suggestions from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, on Monday that Mr. Obama had refused to acknowledge Islamic terrorism and might have ulterior motives for doing so. \u201cWhen you are focused on something as big as safeguarding the country and combating violent extremism,\u201d Mr. Earnest said of the president, \u201cit\u2019s important not to get distracted by things that are so small. \u201d He said Mr. Obama\u2019s record \u201cspeaks for itself, and that record includes a lot of dead terrorists. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628439.1009755}
