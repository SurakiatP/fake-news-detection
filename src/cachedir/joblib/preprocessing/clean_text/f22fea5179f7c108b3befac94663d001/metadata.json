The book, \u201cAdolf Hitler: His Life and His Speeches,\u201d was credited to Baron Adolf Victor von Koerber, a German aristocrat and war hero. Scholars have said that Hitler sought Mr. von Koerber out for the biography because he needed a conservative figure without links to the Nazi Party to help legitimize him as a leader. However, new research says Hitler penned the work himself. This suggests that Hitler had designs on taking power earlier than many historians have previously thought and manipulated public opinion to get there. \u201cAdolf Hitler: His Life and His Speeches\u201d was published two years before \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d the autobiography and manifesto that historians consider the moment Hitler went from political propagandist to leader in waiting. The von Koerber biography was published shortly before Hitler helped lead a bungled coup in Munich known as the Beer Hall Putsch. \u201cIt\u2019s 1923, and Hitler suddenly decides he needs to boost his national profile,\u201d said Thomas Weber, a professor of history and international affairs at the University of Aberdeen, in Scotland, who uncovered documents in Mr. von Koerber\u2019s archival papers that he argues reveals Hitler as the biography\u2019s true author. The documents included a sworn statement by the publisher\u2019s widow. \u201cHe brings out a book in anticipation of revolution,\u201d Professor Weber said in a Skype interview this week, \u201cand we see here a political operator who understands the political process extremely well and knows how to produce a narrative for the kind of leader only he feels he can be. \u201cSo he does not have to expressly say, \u2018I want to be leader.\u2019 He creates the expectation that others will call him to become the leader. \u201d Professor Weber wrote a book expected to be published in English next year titled \u201cMetamorphosis: How Adolf Hitler Became a Nazi. \u201d While researching it, he traveled to an archive in Johannesburg where Mr. von Koerber\u2019s papers are stored. Sven Felix Kellerhoff, author of a recent book on \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and a senior editor at the German newspaper Die Welt, welcomed Professor Weber\u2019s findings. \u201cI\u2019m convinced from the presented sources that Hitler himself wrote this short text or gave at least the basic information to an editor,\u201d Mr. Kellerhoff wrote in an email. \u201cThis is important because it shows that Hitler thought about himself as the \u2018German savior\u2019 as early as 1923. So I think this is a small but important advance in researching Hitler\u2019s biography. \u201d Hitler counted on piggybacking to power via the conservative German elite because at the time, his Nazi Party was essentially a small sectarian group in Munich, a far cry from the political juggernaut it would become. Charles S. Maier, a professor of European and international history at Harvard University, said he found the new research \u201cplausible and illuminating,\u201d but not particularly sensational. \u201cKoerber essentially became a type of \u2018   author\u2019 without acknowledging the sketch,\u201d Professor Maier said in an email, referring to the biographical section of the book. \u201cBut surely this sort of coaching for political biographies must be relatively common in one form or another. \u201d The difference, Professor Maier argued, is that most subjects of ghostwritten memoirs want their own name on the text. Mr. von Koerber\u2019s life took a variety of twists after the book was published. Like a number of his fellow conservative elites who initially supported Hitler, he became disillusioned and worked against Hitler\u2019s rise. Mr. von Koerber was arrested on July 21, 1944, the day after an unsuccessful plot to assassinate Hitler. He spent the rest of the war in a Gestapo prison and then a concentration camp. He was also known to have passed on intelligence to the British. Mr. von Koerber had been virulently   in the 1920s, but his opinions and politics eventually shifted. He went from writing for conservative newspapers to liberal ones, including some owned by Hermann Ullstein, a Jewish newspaper tycoon and publisher. Papers reviewed by Professor Weber show that Mr. von Koerber even hid Mr. Ullstein in his home and helped him get to England. Mr. Ullstein eventually emigrated to New York, where he died in 1943. Mr. von Koerber died in Johannesburg in 1969.'"}, "time": 1742563504.8247066}
