{"duration": 0.4431459903717041, "input_args": {"text": "'shorty BY REV. WILLIAM ALBERTS T he common humanity everyone shares should be the epicenter of the moral universe. Not religion. Our religious founders and saints have different beginnings and beliefs, but all of us share similar birth stories, and at the moment of birth we are most alike. We have different faith traditions, but the same universal need to be loved and to love. We speak different languages, but laugh alike. We don\u2019t look alike, but our facial expressions tell the same story \u2013 of surprise and pleasure, frustration and anger, joy and sadness. We sing different anthems \u2014 with the same pride. We may regard each other as foreigners, yet we love and grieve the same. Anywhere in the world, when people are oppressed, their innate human response is to struggle for justice. Everyone bleeds human. Thus the common humanity all people share is the frame of reference for the moral universe. And our common humanity is powerfully expressed in most religions\u2019 shared belief in The Golden Rule: \u201cSo in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.\u201d (Matthew 7: 12) But, to everyone\u2019s endangerment, political and faith leaders alike are redefining and thus shrinking the moral universe to accommodate their self-interests. Their selective morality is especially seen in today\u2019s presidential campaign. For many white evangelical Christians, morality takes a back seat to belief. Jesus is recorded as teaching, \u201cI was a stranger and you welcomed me.\u201d (Matthew 25: 36), and \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d (Matthew 22: 39). Yet a high majority of evangelicals and their leaders have had no problem supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, despite his denigration of women, Mexicans, Muslims, immigrants, black persons and even a disabled reporter. In fact, a number of evangelical Christian leaders have formed a Faith Advisory Council to help guide Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and evangelical ministers are repeatedly photographed surrounding him and laying their hands on him in prayer. It is about their religious beliefs, not his immoral behavior. Numerous white evangelical Christian leaders have an unwavering faith in Donald Trump. Recently, a video showed an \u201caroused\u201d Trump boasting about being a compulsive sexual predator, who is \u201cautomatically attracted to beautiful . . . I just start kissing them . . . It\u2019s like a magnet . . . I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star . . . you can do anything\u201d to them, including, \u201cgrab them by the pussy.\u201d (\u201cUS election: Full transcript of Donald Trump\u2019s obscene videotape\u201d, BBC News , Oct. 8, 2016) Ironically, in the second presidential debate, shortly before the video surfaced, Donald Trump told Hillary Clinton that, as president, he would have a special prosecutor investigate her misuse of emails when Secretary of State, and said to her, \u201cYou\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Actually, Trump\u2019s self-reported sexual assaults on women indicate he should be prosecuted, and jailed if found guilty \u2013 and, when released, be registered as a sex offender \u2013 for the protection of unsuspecting women. While the leaked videotape has led some white evangelical Christian supporters to distance themselves from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, many others still support him, believing that he will \u201cmake America great again\u201d \u2014 to their Biblical liking . Typical is Ralph Reed, leader of Trump\u2019s religious advisory board and founder and chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. The father of two daughters, Reed was reported as being \u201cdisappointed by\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201c \u2018Inappropriate\u2019 comments.\u201d But Reed said, \u201cI think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their [evangelical voters] hierarchy of their concerns.\u201d He stated that, \u201cpeople of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, grow the economy, appoint conservative judges and oppose the Iran nuclear deal.\u201d (\u201c \u2018Still the best candidate\u2019: Some evangelicals still back Trump despite lewd video,\u201d By Sarah Pulliam Bailey, The Washington Post , Oct. 8, 2016) For Ralph Reed and many other evangelical Christian leaders and their flocks, it is the authority of their selective Biblical beliefs. The Bible says, \u201cSo God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\u201d (Genesis 1: 27) Therefore, these evangelical leaders believe that unborn American children are more worthy of protection than already born Muslim children and adults \u2013 who are protected, by \u201cthe Iran nuclear deal,\u201d from another falsely-based, Iraqi-type, pre-emptive U.S. invasion. The aim of evangelical Christian leaders is not just to protect the unborn, but to proselytize those already born, especially Muslims. Thus a reported \u201c87 percent of all white evangelical Christians in the United States supported\u201d the George W. Bush Administration\u2019s illegal pre-emptive invasion of defenseless Iraq \u2014 certain evangelical leaders even \u201cclaiming that the American invasion of Iraq would create exciting new prospects for proselytizing Muslims.\u201d (\u201cWayward Christian Soldiers, By Charles Marsh, The New York Times , Jan. 20, 2006) In the wake of that devastating criminal war, certain evangelical groups, like Muslim-hating Rev. Franklin Graham and his Samaritan\u2019s Purse organization, flocked to Iraq to join the \u201chumanitarian effort,\u201d with the motivation to harvest for Jesus the Muslims fortunate enough to survive the slaughter. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations said of this obscenely immoral reality: \u201cFranklin Graham obviously thinks it is a war against Islam. . . . This is a guy who gave the invocation at President Bush\u2019s inauguration and believes Islam is a wicked faith. And,\u201c Hooper questioned, \u201che\u2019s going into Iraq in the wake of an invading army and convert people to Christianity? Nothing good is coming from that.\u201d (\u201cGroup to Aid, Proselytize in Postwar Iraq,\u201d By Deborah Caldwell, ABC News , March 27, 2003) Nothing good came out of that worst war crime of the 21 st century. It merely provided another tragic example of the fact that \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d and belief that Jesus is \u201cthe savior of the world\u201d are two sides of the same imperialistic coin. For many evangelical Christians, it is about belief, not behavior. It is about Psalm 139: \u201cFor you created my innermost being: you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\u201d (verses 13, 14) It is about, \u201cYou shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\u201d (Leviticus 18: 25) And Jesus is reported as saying to Pharisees, \u201cHave you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female. . . . For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?\u201d (Matthew 19: 4, 5) Abortion, homosexuality and same-sex marriage are all an \u201cabomination.\u201d It is one\u2019s birth that counts, Not the circumstances surrounding pregnancy and birth. Nor the individual\u2019s \u201cinnermost being\u201d after birth. Especially not one\u2019s \u201c innermost being\u201d leading one to \u201cleave father and mother and be joined\u201d in love to one\u2019s same-sex partner. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence is a classic example of the Biblically-shrunken moral universe of many evangelical Christians. In his debate with Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, Pence said, \u201cFor me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief . . . where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you and so . . . I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\u201d (\u201cThe most important exchanges of the vice presidential debate, annotated,\u201d LA Times , Oct. 4, 2016) \u201cThe sanctity of life\u201d before a child is born. As governor of Indiana, Mike Pence signed a \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act\u201d that, as reported, \u201cwould have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers, for example, by citing their religious beliefs.\u201d That legislation cost Indiana dearly in lost revenue from the boycott of celebrities and conventions that cancelled their planned appearances and meetings in the state. Documented is Pence\u2019s consistent opposition to \u201cmarriage equality,\u201d his opposition to \u201cprotecting LGBT employees,\u201d and his refusal to support \u201cLGBT-inclusive hate-crimes legislation.\u201d (\u201dDonald Trump Clearly Didn\u2019t \u2018Ask the Gays\u2019 About Mike Pence,\u201d By Advocate.com Editors/Authors, advocate.com , July 15, 2016) For Pence, \u201cthe sanctity of life\u201d ends at birth. It is about belief in the inerrancy of The Bible \u2013 which then becomes the epicenter of the moral universe for word-for-word- Bible -believing Christians. Here one finds certainty and authority, which allow one to seek to convert other persons to one\u2019s true beliefs, rather than engage with them, and the truths they live by, as equals. Thus for such Bible -believing Christians, it is not about loving your neighbor as yourself as Jesus taught, but wanting your neighbor to be like yourself. The Bible allows them to act out their need to gain power over and control other persons \u2013 and allay their own innermost anxieties and doubts. The Bible is often used by people to avoid understanding why they behave as they do. Forgiveness covers a multitude of sins, and while liberating one from conscious guilt, may provide little self-insight into one\u2019s behavior. Unquestioning belief in \u201cthe \u201cWord of God\u201d allows those with anti-introspective tendencies to dismiss scientifically-based psychological knowledge of human development and behavior that contradicts the Source of their authority. This belief allows them to dumb down their God to accommodate their cultural conditioning and rationalizations. Again, the words of Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence are revealing. After Donald Trump gave a brief automatic apology for his sexually abusive behavior toward women in that videotape, Pence used words of faith to make Trump\u2019s compulsive criminal behavior disappear. \u201c \u2018We all fall short of the glory of God,\u2019 \u201c Pence said, \u201cand praised Trump for his \u2018humility\u2019 in asking forgiveness.\u201d Pence continued, \u201cIt takes a big man to know when he is wrong and to admit it and to have the humility to apologize and be transparent and be vulnerable with people. . . . Donald Trump last night showed that he is a big man.\u201d (\u201cPence: Trump showed \u2018humility\u2019 with apology,\u201d By Jessie Hellmann, TheHill , Oct. 10, 2016) In a New Hampshire campaign speech, which was greatly lauded by mainstream media, Michelle Obama said entirely different words regarding Donald Trump\u2019s lewd video boasts about sexually assaulting women. While effectively denouncing Trump\u2019s self-professed criminal behavior toward women, she took the occasion to declare that the epicenter of the moral universe is America and that Hillary Clinton possesses the moral compass. \u201cShaken to my core\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201clewd comments,\u201d Mrs. Obama emphasized that, \u201cthe measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.\u201d Then, referring to Trump, she said, \u201cWe have a candidate for President of the United States who . . . last week . . . [was] actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. . . . The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman.\u201d (\u201cRead Michelle Obama\u2019s Speech Condemning Donald Trump\u2019s Comments About Women,\u201d By Katie Reilly, motto.time.com , Oct. 13, 2016) Michelle Obama then pivoted to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy, saying, \u201cI believe with all my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president . . . who truly cares about us and our children.\u201c Thus, she said, \u201cIf we let Hillary\u2019s opponent win this election . . . we won\u2019t be just setting a bad example for our kids, but for our entire world. Because, \u201cshe added, \u201c for so long America has been a model for countries across the globe, pushing them to educate their girls, insisting they give more rights to their women.\u201d She called America \u201cthe greatest nation on earth,\u201d and also stated, \u201cWe have the power to show our children that America\u2019s greatness comes from recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all our people.\u201d ( Ibid ) \u201cThe measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.\u201d How about: the measure of any society is also how it treats the women and girls in other societies ? That measure goes to the heart of The Golden Rule and the epicenter of the moral universe. And with that inclusiveness as the measure, Hillary Clinton fails miserably. If \u201cthe measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls,\u201d Iraq was measuring up comparably well. Under Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule, Iraq\u2019s education system was reported to be \u201ctop notch and female literacy rates were the highest in the region.\u201d In fact, \u201ceducation was a major priority for Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, so much so that in 1982 Iraq received . . . the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) award for eradicating illiteracy.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cWomen were integral to Iraq\u2019s economy and held high positions in both the private and public sectors, thanks in large part to labor and employment laws that guaranteed equal pay, six months fully paid maternity leave and protection from sexual harassment . . . conditions enjoyed by working women in Iraq rival[ing] those of working women in the United States.\u201d (\u201cWas Life for Iraqi Women Better Under Saddam?,\u201d By Rania Khalek, muftah.org , March 19, 2013) Also reported, \u201cIraq had one of the best national health care systems in the Middle East. . . . and the Iraqi people enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the Middle East.\u201d (\u201cLiving Conditions in Iraq: A Criminal Tragedy,\u201d by Ghali Hassan, globalresearch.ca , June 3, 2005) Then came the devastating U.S.-controlled UN economic sanctions that resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 Iraqi children under five years of age. Following those murderous sanctions, the George W. Bush administration, with the support of then Senator Hillary Clinton, launched an illegal, falsely-based pre-emptive was against defenseless Iraq. That unnecessary criminal war killed over a million Iraqi civilians, left some two million Iraqi women widowed, and an estimated five million girls and boys orphaned. (\u201cWas life for Iraqi Women Better Under Saddam?,\u201d Ibid) And loved ones are grieving for almost 5,000 American troops killed and over 100,000 wounded in body and mind. In response to this carnage, Hillary Clinton said her vote for the invasion of Iraq was a \u201cmistake\u201d \u2013 as she announced her candidacy for president in the 2016 campaign. And with her candidacy, she cites her \u201clifelong commitment to fighting for children and families,\u201d saying, \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life fighting for children, families and our country and I\u2019m not stopping now.\u201d (\u201cDocumentary Style Ad Features Hillary Clinton\u2019s Lifelong Record Fighting for Children and Families, hillaryclinton.com ) With her presidential campaign supported by American Iraq war hawks, nothing may stop her from continuing to destroy \u201cchildren and families\u201d in other societies. (See, \u201cNeocon War Hawks Want Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump. No Surprise \u2013 They\u2019ve Always Backed Her,\u201d By Branko Marcetic, inthesetimes.com , March 23, 2016) It is the same story with Libya. If \u201cthe measure of a society is how it treats its women and girls,\u201d Libya excelled. According to Harvard researcher Dr. Garikai Chengu, \u201cGaddafi\u2019s Libya was Africa\u2019s most prosperous democracy.\u201d Concerning women, Chengu writes \u201cThe United Nations Human Rights Council praised Mr. Gaddafi profusely [for] women\u2019s rights.\u201d They included \u201cthe right to education, hold jobs, divorce, hold property\u201d and \u201cequal pay for equal work.\u201d Plus, \u201cLibyan working mothers enjoyed a range of benefits including cash bonuses for children, free day care, free health care centers and retirement at 55.\u201d Education was a human right and it was free for all Libyans. And \u201chealth care was a human right.\u201d (\u201cGaddafi\u2019s Libya was Africa\u2019s Most Prosperous Democracy,\u201d Foreign Policy Journal , Jan. 12, 2013) Dr. Chengu states that \u201cprior to Colonel Gaddafi, King Idris let Standard Oil essentially write Libya\u2019s petroleum laws. Mr. Gaddafi put an end to all of that.\u201d He deposited the \u201cmoney from oil proceeds . . . directly into every Libyan citizen\u2019s bank account.\u201d Chengu muses: \u201cOne wonders if Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum will continue this practice under the new democratic Libya?\u201d He also asks: \u201cWith regard to health care, education and economic justice, is America in any position to export democracy to Libya or should America have taken a leaf out of Libya\u2019s book?\u201d He then adds this commentary: \u201cTherefore, isn\u2019t it ironic that America supposedly bombarded Libya to spread democracy, but increasingly education in America is becoming a privilege, not a right, and ultimately a debt sentence.\u201d ( Ibid ) Col. Gaddafi himself looked at the invasion and plunder of Iraq, and saw the handwriting on America\u2019s imperialistic wall. He wrote, \u201cThey want to do to Libya what they did to Iraq and what they are itching to do to Iran. They want to take back the oil that was nationalized by these countries\u2019 revolutions.\u201d And, \u201cThey want to re-establish military bases that were shut down by the revolutions and to install client regimes that will subordinate the country\u2019s wealth and labor to imperialistic corporate interests. All else is lies and deception.\u201d (\u201cFacts about Libya under Gaddafi that you probably did not know about!,\u201d By mystory2323, ireport.cnn.com , Nov. 21, 2012) The rights and prosperity enjoyed by woman and girls \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 in Libya was enough to threaten any capitalistic society. Col. Gaddafi had to go. And, as reported, Hillary Clinton played a key role in his overthrow and death. In his article, \u201cBenghazi Won\u2019t Stick to Hillary Clinton, But the Disastrous Libyan Intervention Should,\u201d foreign policy journalist Joel Gillin writes that, as Secretary of State, she helped to convince President Obama that a \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d \u2014 in the form of military force was needed \u201dto stop the imminent slaughter of civilians in Benghazi\u201d \u2013 the intervention opposed by Robert Gates, then Secretary of Defense, \u201cand other top national security officials.\u201d Gillin states that \u201cno solid evidence existed to back up Clinton\u2019s statements of the impending bloodbath in Benghazi.\u201d ( New Republic, May 27, 2015) (See also, \u201cEven Critics understate how catastrophically bad the Hillary Clinton-led NATO bombing of Libya was,\u201d By Ben Norton, salon.com , Mar. 2, 2016) In his article, \u201cWho said Gaddafi had to go?,\u201d Hugh Roberts, professor of North African History, wrote that the decision \u201cwas to declare Gaddafi guilty in advance of a massacre of defenseless civilians and instigate a process of destroying his regime and him (and his family) by way of punishment of a crime he was yet to commit, and actually unlikely to commit, and to persist with this process despite his repeated offers to suspend military action.\u201d Ironically, Roberts states, it was the U.S.-led NATO forces that committed a \u201cblood bath\u201d against the Libyan people, not Muammar Gaddafi. Possibly 25,000 Libyans were killed, \u201cmany thousands injured and hundreds of thousands . . . displaced.\u201d ( London Review of Books , Nov. 17, 2011) How many of those victims were women and girls? Afterwards, Secretary of State Clinton appeared on television, and in response to the news of the toppling of Col. Gaddafi\u2019s government and his brutal death, she laughed and chuckled, \u201cWe came, we saw, and he died!\u201d (\u201cSee Flashback 2011: Hillary Clinton Laughs About Killing Muammar Gaddafi: \u2018We Came, We Saw, He Died!\u2019,\u201d realclearpolitics.com , Posted June 19, 2015) That shocking television scene provides insight into her circumscribed morality. \u201cThe measure of a society is how it treats its women and girls.\u201d Tell that to the Palestinian people. Hillary Clinton repeatedly says that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d But in her mind, that does not apply to Palestinian women and girls. In an article, \u201cHillary Clinton Is No Feminist: Just Look at Her Stance on Palestine,\u201d Nadia Elia, Diaspora Palestinian writer and political commentator, quotes \u201ca young Palestinian student, Layali Awwad,\u201d who, in a letter to Clinton, wrote, \u201cWhen you choose to speak about my homeland, not once do you mention Israel\u2019s human rights violations against Palestinian women and children.\u201d Elia continues, \u201cIn 2014, Clinton again expressed full support for Israel as it was engaging in a massive military assault on Gaza,\u201d whereas \u201ceven the mainstream US media, while otherwise supportive of Israel, repeatedly commented on the disproportionate number of women and children killed by Israeli fire.\u201d And when a journalist asked Clinton \u201cabout the bombing of a UN school where homeless civilians had taken shelter, she began with her formulaic \u2018Israel has the right to defend itself\u2019 reply.\u201d Elia states that, \u201cfifteen people were killed in that bombing and more than 100 injured, but to her \u2018women and children\u2019 were merely a complication.\u201d ( commondreams.com , Aug. 8, 2016) To Hillary Clinton, \u201cthe measure of how a society treats its women and children\u201d does not apply to how the occupying Israeli power treats Palestinian women and children. Nada Elia sums up Clinton\u2019s moral blind spot this way: \u201cWe can go back to every instance of Israel violating international law and the human rights of Palestinians and Clinton will invariably be on the side of the oppressor, the illegal occupier, the racist regime. This is not what feminism is about.\u201d Elia then says, \u201cFeminism is not only concerned with women and children, but also seeks to eliminate various systems of structural violence. And,\u201d she states, \u201cwhile the examples above are from Palestine, we can look elsewhere, around the globe to see how detrimental her hawkish political interventions have proven, from Pakistan to Libya, Honduras and beyond.\u201d ( Ibid ) There is also the Clinton campaign\u2019s demonizing of President Putin, and linking him as favoring Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. And the campaign\u2019s attempt to deflect the revelation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s dishonesty, revealed in her emails, leaked by WikiLeaks: by alleging, without documented proof, that the emails were hacked by the Russians to influence the U.S. election on behalf of Trump\u2019s campaign. Echoes of McCarthyism and the \u201cCommunist scare?\u201d Never mind that the emails reveal a two-faced Clinton, telling bankers in private, who paid her around $225,000 for a speech, that they can count on her, and saying to voters in public what she believes they want to hear. Donald Trump\u2019s crime is his compulsion to sexually assault individual women. If he obtains the power of the presidency, his delusions of grandeur, paranoia, distortion of reality and impulsiveness would be boundlessly destructive. Hillary Clinton\u2019s crime is her compulsion to militarily assault whole countries. As president, she would continue America\u2019s imperialistic global war on terrorism, with countless more women and girls at risk. In 2005, the United Methodist News Service reported that a delegation of five United Methodist Bishops paid a \u201cpastoral visit\u201d to President George W. Bush at the White House. They \u201cpresented Bush, a fellow United Methodist, with a Bible signed by the Council of Bishops, and they shared a moment of prayer with him.\u201d Their \u201cpastoral visit\u201d also included \u201ctelling the president . . . they shared his commitment to building a better world.\u201d (\u201cUnited Methodist bishops meet with president, open door to future,\u201d by Tim Tanton, archives.gcah.org , May 3, 2005) Bush continued his devastating criminal war against Iraq. Later, United Methodist leaders built him a monument (The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum) on the campus of Southern Methodist University. If Hillary Clinton, a United Methodist, is elected president, beware of a delegation of proud United Methodist Bishops, with Bible in hand, visiting her at the White House. For many United Methodist leaders, the epicenter of the universe is power, not morality. The election is rigged, but not in the way Donald Trump repeatedly charges. It is rigged by the Democratic and Republican parties, and the corporate media, to limit our choices to their two immoral presidential candidates. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton is worthy of one\u2019s vote. The moral universe encircles all women and girls, and all men and boys \u2013 everywhere .
