[The Organization of American States (OAS) has stepped in, demanding that its head, Luis Almagro, be allowed to meet with L\u00f3pez in person.  L\u00f3pez has been in solitary confinement for over a month and his health status remains a mystery. On Wednesday evening, Senator Marco Rubio ( ) confirmed on Twitter that he had information that L\u00f3pez\u2019s health was in \u201cvery serious\u201d condition and had been transferred to a military hospital. The government responded by denying the rumors and airing the video in question. Almagro made his demand to be allowed into Venezuela and confirm L\u00f3pez\u2019s wellbeing on Twitter, following nearly two days of speculation that the opposition leader, who turned 46 in prison last week, may be close to losing his life. I demand to visit @leopoldolopez based on the commitments that #Venezuela has with the   System of Human Rights @OAS_official pic. twitter.   \u2014   Luis Almagro (@Almagro_OEA2015) May 4, 2017,  \u201cThe government of Venezuela has refused to confirm political prisoner Leopoldo L\u00f3pez\u2019s state of health,\u201d Almagro added. Almagro has long been a thorn in the side of the Venezuelan government, using his power as the head of the regional organization to demand that Venezuela adhere to the OAS\u2019s democratic charter. The organization has a right to suspend or expel nations that do not adhere to democratic standards, as it did with Cuba in the 1960s. In response to pressure from the OAS to adhere to its own constitution and hold presidential elections, the Venezuelan government officially petitioned to leave the group altogether last week. Venezuela\u2019s withdrawal from the OAS would take at least two years, however, which means Almagro is in his right to demand to see L\u00f3pez. On Thursday night,   protesters held a candlelight vigil outside the notorious Ramo Verde prison in which L\u00f3pez is serving a   sentence for organizing peaceful protests in 2014. Leading the vigil was Lilian Tintori, his wife, and Antonieta L\u00f3pez, his mother, who say they have not been permitted to visit L\u00f3pez in over a month and demand to see him in person and confirm his good health. The government has also barred L\u00f3pez\u2019s attorneys from visiting him. Tintori posted regular updates on Twitter from the gates of Ramo Verde, confirming that the government had dispatched a line of soldiers to block her and supporters from crossing into the prison. 11:18 pm DENUNCIO estoy en la c\u00e1rcel militar de Ramo Verde, no me dejan pasar. Leopoldo L\u00f3pez tiene 32 d\u00edas incomunicado. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Lilian Tintori (@liliantintori) May 5, 2017,  \u201cI denounce  \u2014   I am at the Ramo Verde military prison, they do not let me in,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cLeopoldo L\u00f3pez has been incommunicado 32 days. \u201d In addition to calls from Almagro to allow international observers to confirm L\u00f3pez\u2019s health status, the opposition leader\u2019s father, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez Gil, has requested that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) send a representative to Venezuela to check on his son. Other international organizations, such as Amnesty International, have weighed in to demand L\u00f3pez be allowed to see his family. On Wednesday night, news spread on social media that L\u00f3pez\u2019s condition at the prison had deteriorated so much that he had been transferred to a military hospital. Shortly after those rumors began, National Assembly minority leader and suspected drug kingpin Diosdado Cabello, who was hosting a live state television program at the time, announced that L\u00f3pez  \u2014   who he referred to as \u201cthe Ramo Verde monster\u201d  \u2014   was healthy and published a bizarre video of a man claiming to be L\u00f3pez confirming his good health. The man in the video appeared significantly muscular and wore a belt around his waist, which some on social media noted would violate the rules of Ramo Verde. He also appeared to be in daylight, while claiming the time of the video to be 9:00PM local. Tintori denounced the video as \u201cfalse\u201d on Twitter and wrote, \u201cThe only proof of life we accept is to see Leopoldo. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628499.627521}
