Labrador Wayne Hayes refuses to eat normal dog biscuits, preferring a discontinued American 80s brand of dog food called Chunkiez that his owners have to buy off the internet at vast expense. Hayes said: \u201cI\u2019m all about Chunkiez Beefy Mix because the box they come in has such a cool design aesthetic. It just speaks to my vibe. \u201cI realise it\u2019s \u00a317 a box because they stopped making it in 1984 and there\u2019s only one warehouse in Canada that has stock, but like everything in my life it\u2019s paid for by my parents.\u201d Hayes, who also claims to like postmen and fireworks, reckons he is friends with all the working class bull terriers at his local park even though they growl at him whenever he approaches. \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742563340.6687486}
