Attorney General Eric Holder to represent the liberal state in future legal battles with the Trump administration. [\u201cWith the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead,\u201d California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n and California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon wrote in a statement Wednesday.  \u201cThe Legislature will work with the Governor and our next Attorney General to protect California\u2019s economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThe Legislature has retained the services of an expert legal team from the   Covington  Burling law firm, led by former United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. \u201d Holder, who left the Obama administration in 2015, \u201cwill serve as outside counsel to the Legislature, advising us in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made. \u201d \u201cI am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California\u2019s residents and policy priorities,\u201d Mr. Holder said in a statement, the New York Times reports. \u201cI am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature. \u201d California lawmakers\u2019 decision to tap Holder, a lifelong Democrat, seems fitting given his public criticism of Trump. In October, Holder called   nominee Trump dangerous for implying he may prosecute Hillary Clinton for using a private email server without permission while she was Secretary of State, and destroying tens of thousands of emails on the server. Be afraid of any candidate who says he will order   to act on his command This is   is @ \u2019s not qualified,  \u2014   Eric Holder (@EricHolder) October 10, 2016,  Holder called FBI Director James Comey\u2019s   of Clinton\u2019s private email case a \u201cmistake,\u201d and implied Trump\u2019s election was \u201crigged\u201d because of voter suppression. But perhaps more troubling is that the Covington  Burling law firm, of which Holder is partner, has a history of punishing Republicans and protecting Democrats.   Holder\u2019s tenure in the Obama White House was plagued by scandal, a fact not lost on one California lawmaker. \u201cIt is not surprising that California Democrats would hire someone with a record of lawlessness to represent them,\u201d Assemblyman Travis Allen\u2019s wrote in a statement, responding to what he called the California Democrats\u2019 \u201cFast and Furious\u201d hiring of Holder. \u201cEric Holder\u2019s major accomplishments as Attorney General was allowing illegal gun running into Mexico with Fast and Furious and then being held in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the investigation,\u201d said Allen.  \u201cThe goal of the California Democrats is clear: an open border with no restrictions on human traffickers, gun runners and drug smugglers. Eric Holder has the record to help them accomplish this goal. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742563783.5383735}
