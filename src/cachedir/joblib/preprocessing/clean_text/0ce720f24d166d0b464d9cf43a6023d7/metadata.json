This week he will debut his first new work since the album, at the 2017 Whitney Biennial, which opens on Friday in its first iteration since the museum moved downtown in 2015. A   gallery will feature Mr. Washington\u2019s \u201cHarmony of Difference,\u201d a   sweep of   music with accompanying video from the filmmaker A. G. Rojas. As he has gained attention, Mr. Washington, 36, has taken up the role of a jazz ambassador. And with \u201cHarmony of Difference,\u201d he adopts a familiar but still relevant argument: Improvised music can represent a metaphor for a more perfect American union. In this case, Mr. Washington set out to use the musical concept of counterpoint (various melodic crosscurrents flowing together) to symbolize a coexistence that is not just peaceful but actively engaged. \u201cWith our political climate right now, there\u2019s just so much focus on the negative aspect of our diversity,\u201d he said last week in a phone interview from Los Angeles. \u201cI thought it was ironic that we look at it as this problem that we have to solve, when it\u2019s really a gift. \u201d Of \u201cHarmony,\u201d he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to sound chaotic. I wanted to show how you can pull these different musical pieces together in a way that felt harmonious. \u201d The   suite coheres around   harmonies and rhythms that mix swing, funk and calypso. It\u2019s of a piece with \u201cThe Epic,\u201d which Mr. Washington recorded with a large band, a choir and a string section, though here only the final song, over 13 minutes long, features strings and voices. Through the first five tracks, Mr. Rojas\u2019s video pans patterns painted by Mr. Washington\u2019s sister Amani Washington. At the end of the fifth tune we see a composite canvas, with all five patterns creating an abstract face. In the gallery, that video will play simultaneously on   TVs on three walls. When it ends, a projector will illuminate the one bare wall with a different video as the sixth tune begins. Patrons would presumably gather around the single screen to watch the culminating piece together. The visuals here are mostly portraits of young Angelenos, alone or in small groups, with a cosmic   production style that reflects elements of Mr. Washington\u2019s aesthetic. Mr. Rojas, who makes music videos often but rarely works with jazz musicians, said he felt a sense of freedom working with Mr. Washington. He described \u201ca kind of fluid emotion that doesn\u2019t really exist when you\u2019re doing a video for an artist that has lyrics or a certain specific structure. \u201d This exhibition is Mr. Washington\u2019s entree into a major museum since arriving on the national scene. Successful jazz musicians usually depend on grants and professorships if they ascend far enough, working in museums is a natural part of the career path. But Mr. Washington has come via a slightly different route. He grew up in South Central Los Angeles, the son of a jazz musician and the nephew of a dance company director, and he came of age in a small ecosystem of mentorship, learning from elders like Billy Higgins and Gerald Wilson. Working with fellow young musicians he had known since grade school, such as Ronald Bruner Jr. and Cameron Graves, he has gone on to record and tour with major Los Angeles musicians outside jazz, like Flying Lotus, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar. He recorded most of \u201cThe Epic\u201d in 2011, during a monthlong recording binge with the loose federation of young jazz musicians calling themselves the West Coast Get Down. Since its release, he has toured constantly, playing his rigorous, largely instrumental music at rock clubs more often than jazz venues. Mr. Washington\u2019s album experienced remarkable success partly thanks to his reputation for working across genres, but also because it responded to a desire for dauntless, farseeing art in the age of Black Lives Matter. \u201cThe Epic\u201d loops in elements of 1970s funk and 1980s RB without abandoning jazz\u2019s guiding ethic  \u2014   one of earnest and determined humanism. On that triple album, for all the dozens of musicians, there seems to be another, more ambiguous layer in the recording. It could just be all those instruments resonating with one another, or a result of the microphones that were used, or something more inexplicable. But a humid electricity  \u2014   some illusory, conductive force  \u2014   certainly hangs throughout most of the songs. It\u2019s something like the feeling of an orchestra tuning, or the swell of a bass amplifier just before it feeds back. \u201cWhen you have a lot of musicians who are connected to each other on a special level, and are really reaching for that, you get a feeling,\u201d Mr. Washington said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stirring. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564472.0065637}
