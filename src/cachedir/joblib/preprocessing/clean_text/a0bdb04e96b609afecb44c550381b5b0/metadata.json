On Friday, the   company stuck to that position. It said it had no intention of ending a new test of its   vehicles in San Francisco, even though California regulators had said the service was illegal because Uber had not obtained the necessary permits. Uber said its   cars were still on the road and picking up passengers. The dispute is rooted in Uber\u2019s refusal to seek a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which would allow it to test autonomous vehicles under certain conditions. Companies like Google, Tesla Motors and   have all gotten such permits. Uber officials contend that under the letter of California law, the company does not need a permit because the motor vehicles department defines autonomous vehicles as those that drive \u201cwithout the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person. \u201d Uber said its modified,   Volvo XC90s require human oversight, and therefore do not fit California\u2019s definition of an autonomous vehicle. \u201cThis rule just doesn\u2019t apply to us,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, vice president of Uber\u2019s advanced technologies group, said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear a belt and suspenders and whatever else if you\u2019re wearing a dress. \u201d The motor vehicles department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But in a letter to Uber on Friday, lawyers in the California attorney general\u2019s office reiterated the state\u2019s position that the company pull the   off the road until it got the permits or face unspecified consequences. The episode serves the latest volley in Uber\u2019s war with local and state regulators  \u2014   not only in the United States, but in many of the more than 70 countries in which the company operates. Uber has previously grappled with the authorities in California over safety concerns. And Otto, the   trucking   founded by Mr. Levandowski and acquired by Uber in August, has flouted state laws in Nevada in the past. Uber argues the way its technology is used differs little from the way Tesla Motors, the electric carmaker founded by Elon Musk, uses its technology. Tesla offers a   system called Autopilot, which gives drivers the ability to \u201cmatch speed to traffic conditions, keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website. As of Dec. 8, Tesla held a permit in California for   testing. Uber said that permit did not apply to the wider commercial use of   cars bought by consumers, and that the motor vehicle department\u2019s   process should be consistent across the types of vehicles on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s an important issue of principle about when companies can operate   cars on the roads and the uneven application of statewide rules across very similar types of technology,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said. A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.'"}, "time": 1742564560.4135911}
