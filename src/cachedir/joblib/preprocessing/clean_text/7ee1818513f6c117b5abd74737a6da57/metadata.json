The charged particles are coming from a coronal hole on the sun that is currently facing Earth. If Earth\u2019s magnetic field was hit by charged particles the effects could also include radar and satellite interference, causing problems phone and internet networks and navigation services. Power grid operators in the US were put on alert yesterday following concerning space weather forecasts. But the impact could be felt all over the world. Warnings were issued by the operator of the biggest power grid in the US, PJM Interconnection LLC, as well as by Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages high-voltage power lines across North America, reports Bloomberg . These were the result of US Space Weather Prediction Center raising a \u2018serious\u2019 G3 level storm alert, though the alert was later downgraded to a less severe G2 storm. \u2018Voltage corrections may be required, false alarms triggered on some protection devices\u2019, said the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center. \u2018Drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, and corrections may be needed for orientation problems\u2019. The \u2018moderate\u2019 G2 warning remains in affect today. The solar storms could potentially affect telecommunications and power infrastructures all over the globe. The UK\u2019s Met Office space weather forecast for today said: \u2018Elevated solar winds are expected throughout the period, with G1-G2 minor to moderate geomagnetic storms forecast.\u2019'"}, "time": 1742562139.0859027}
