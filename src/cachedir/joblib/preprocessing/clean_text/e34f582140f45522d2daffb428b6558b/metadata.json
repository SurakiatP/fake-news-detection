A photo posted by Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) on Jan 20, 2017 at 12:31pm PST,  As House Oversight chairman, Chaffetz played a significant role in investigating Clinton following the revelation that she had used an unsecured private email server to save classified documents she came into contact with in her capacity as Secretary of State. Chaffetz has personally demanded an FBI investigation into Clinton, arguing that Clinton\u2019s claim she was unaware of her breach of security protocol did not match the evidence the FBI had initially uncovered. Chaffetz was extremely critical of FBI director James Comey\u2019s decision not to prosecute Clinton for her actions, and vowed to continue the investigation following Clinton\u2019s defeat in the 2016 presidential election. Upon winning the presidency, President Donald Trump announced he would not seek to further investigate Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back through this,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cI think it would be very, very divisive for the country. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563224.8835607}
