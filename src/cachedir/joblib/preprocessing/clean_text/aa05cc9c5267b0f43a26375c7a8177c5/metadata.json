Does that make sense? \\nLike people saying, \u201cOh, here\u2019s a ballot. Here\u2019s another ballot. Throw it away. Oh, here\u2019s one I like. We\u2019ll keep that one.\u201d \\nI have real problems, so get your ballots in. \\nTrump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. \\nDonald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote. \\nConsider the contradiction in Trump\u2019s message.
