[Chairman Meadows told attendees at a Heritage Foundation tax event, \u201cWe need to get tax reform done sooner (rather) than later and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of July. \u201d  Meadows said that we need to have an agreement on tax reform in the next 3 or 4 weeks and that negotiations will fare much better once Congress moves past the idea of a border adjustment tax. \u201cThere is no consensus for the border adjustment tax. The sooner we acknowledge that and get on with a plan that actually works and actually can build consensus, the better off we will be,\u201d the North Carolina congressman added. Meadows negotiated with former Tuesday   Tom MacArthur ( ) to craft the MacArthur amendment. The amendment galvanized enough support for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to pass through the House. Now, Meadows wants to negotiate a tax reform deal, even if that means getting rid of Congress\u2019s vacation in August. Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) the former Freedom Caucus chair, also dispelled the notion of a border adjustment tax. A border adjustment tax (BAT) would tax imports at 20 percent while exempting exports from the tax. Jordan said that lawmakers need to eliminate the idea of revenue neutrality for tax reform, which he argues does not amount to a real tax cut for Americans. \u201cLetting families keep more of their money is not a cost to government \u2014  it\u2019s called freedom,\u201d Jordan said. The Ohio congressman chided the current talks of the House budget negotiations. Jordan said, \u201cRight now a budget cannot pass in the House. \u201d Congressman Dave Brat ( ) explained that this is a \u201cone in a century opportunity\u201d to create economic growth through tax reform. Jack Spencer, the vice president for the Institute for Economic Freedom at Heritage, asked the Freedom Caucus panel how the Senate might jeopardize the reconciliation and budget process by retaining Obamacare\u2019s taxes in the Senate health care bill. Jordan chided, \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t help it. That\u2019s the Senate\u2019s job. \u201d Congressman Warren Davidson ( ) another Freedom Caucus member, reiterated Jordan\u2019s emphasis on real tax cuts for American families. \u201cWe can\u2019t tweak around the edges, we need to go big,\u201d Davidson said.'"}, "time": 1742562044.91305}
