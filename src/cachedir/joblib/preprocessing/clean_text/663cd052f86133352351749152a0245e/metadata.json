[Despite the fact that South African legendary golfer Ernie Els and #3 golfer in the World Rory McIlroy were both trashed on social media for playing with the president, Crouse doesn\u2019t find it surprising that Trump should have such a pull on tour professionals. She writes, \u201cThe results were hardly surprising. The clubhouses at PGA Tour stops have long trended Republican, and the sport\u2019s target demographic  \u2014   rich, mostly white men  \u2014   is far different from the women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims who have at times been the most offended by the president\u2019s statements and positions. \u201d  Yet, despite Crouse\u2019s above conclusion, Els didn\u2019t say he wanted to play with Trump because he agreed with all his policies but that he did so out of respect for the office.  \u201cI\u2019m not silly to what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Els, who owns 47 combined PGA and European Tour victories including four major championships. \u201cI know this is probably the most polarizing president of my time. \u201d Els added, \u201cWhether you agree or not, I felt it was a duty to play with the president when you get the call. \u201d   golfer Pat Perez isn\u2019t the least bit shy of acknowledging his support for the 45th president, saying that he would play with Trump \u201cin a heartbeat. \u201d So, now he can expect his Twitter and Facebook feeds to be trashed by Trump haters. To his credit, he obviously doesn\u2019t care too much about that. Moreover, Perez commented that he would have turned down an invitation from Hillary Clinton if she had won the election in November. Golf icon Tiger Woods and L. P. G. A. player Lexi Thompson, both have teed it up with The Donald, subjecting themselves to social media scorn as well. Thompson claims Trump hit his driver 250 yards. Trump becomes the fourth president with whom Tiger has played, having joined George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Obama on the golf course during their reign as leader of the free world. Tiger quipped after playing with Trump that he was impressed with how the president took quite a \u201clash\u201d at the golf ball. He added that his round was \u201cfun,\u201d and \u201cOur discussion topics were  . \u201d One particular PGA player, Jim Herman has a strong affinity toward the President. Trump took Herman under his wing as an assistant pro at his course in Bedminster, N. J. Eventually, Trump sponsored Herman early in his career in 2006. Last Year Herman won his first PGA tour event and has captured some $6 million on the tour. The    Herman, who has played with Trump hundreds of times, was invited by then   Trump to attend his inauguration in January.  \u201cIt\u2019s still very hard for me to separate \u2018President Donald Trump\u2019 from the guy I\u2019ve played with for the last 10 years,\u201d Herman admitted. \u201cI think of how generous Mr. Trump and all of those people were in helping me make it to the PGA Tour. So on that day in Washington, the inauguration was almost surreal in seeing him and his children and some members of his clubs I hadn\u2019t seen in many years, all of us back together to share in that unique moment in American history. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562037.2772374}
