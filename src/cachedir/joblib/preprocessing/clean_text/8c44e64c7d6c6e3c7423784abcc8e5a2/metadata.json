Democrats: \\n\u201cThe banks are obviously eager to settle [and not go to trial]. [P]art of that settlement... will go to the victims of the crime you committed, but some of the money will go to pay restitution in the form of giving that money to non-profit organizations. These are non-profit organizations that are overwhelmingly progressive and serve as an adjunct to the Democratic party.\u201d \\nOne group he mentioned on \u201c The Kelly File \u201d was fairly benign-sounding: \\n\u201cOne organization that has received millions of dollars is in New York called the Asian Americans for Equality. Sounds like a great idea, right? The problem is, when you look into this organization which got money from banks via the Department of Justice, this is an organization affiliated with the Communist Workers Party. I didn\\'t even know the Communist Workers Party was around anymore and, in fact, the organization that received this money is sympathetic to the North Korean regime.\u201d \\nIndeed, the New York Times reports that many of the founders of Asian Americans for Equality (AAE) were active members of the Communist Workers Party, though AAE has since distanced itself from any modern-day ties. \\nIn August, Andy Koenig of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce wrote in The Wall Street Journal about the giveaways by the DOJ to friendly groups, or as he put it, \u201ca handout to the administration\\'s allies\u201d [emphasis added]: \\n\"Some groups on the list\u2014Catholic Charities, for instance\u2014are relatively nonpolitical. Others\u2014La Raza, the National Urban League, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and more\u2014are anything but. \\nMany of these groups engage in voter registration , community organizing and lobbying on liberal policy priorities at every level of government. They also provide grants to other liberal groups not eligible for payouts under the settlements. Thanks to the Obama administration, and the fungibility of money, the settlements\u2019 beneficiaries can now devote hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to these activities.\" \\nJudicial Watch began an investigation in 2012, and here\\'s what it said about how the Obama administration ladled out the vast amounts of money: \\n\u201cThe Department of Justice (DOJ) will determine which \\'qualified organizations\\' get leftover settlement cash and Democrat-tied groups like the scandal-plagued Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) and the open-borders National Council of La Raza (NCLR) stand to get large sums based on the hastily arranged deal which got court approval in just a few days.\u201d \\nThe disgraced ACORN , the group that used protests to pressure banks into giving mortgages to people who couldn\\'t qualify , was among those receiving Obama justice department funds. The group is now known under its new name, Mutual Housing Association of New York. \\nThe DOJ also gave funds to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which carries the very name of the legislation signed into law by Bill Clinton \u2014 The Community Reinvestment Act \u2014 believed by many to be responsible for the implosion of the mortgage-lending industry. \\nSome additional groups receiving the bank settlement money included: \\nMinneapolis High Rise Representative Council [ACORN affiliate] \\nLa Raza '"}, "time": 1742561809.1520028}
