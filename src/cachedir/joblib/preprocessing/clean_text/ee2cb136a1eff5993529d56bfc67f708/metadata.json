Trump its person of the year for 2016, calling him the \u201cpresident of the divided states of America. \u201d Mr. Trump was not happy about that title, but called his selection a \u201ctremendous honor. \u201d As NBC was building suspense for the magazine\u2019s carefully staged announcement on the \u201cToday\u201d show, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter at 7:18 a. m. that he would appear shortly on the program. The annual marketing gimmick has, since the 1920s, attempted to select a single figure or a group that has influenced the year\u2019s events. Mr. Trump beat out 10 other finalists announced on Monday, including Hillary Clinton Simone Biles, the Olympic gymnast Beyonc\u00e9 Mark Zuckerberg and the Flint, Mich.   the residents and civil engineers who sounded the alarm on   water in the city. The magazine\u2019s \u201cNo. 2\u201d person of the year was Mrs. Clinton, who is on track to win the popular vote but lost the Electoral College in the presidential election to Mr. Trump. In a phone interview with Matt Lauer, a host of \u201cToday,\u201d Mr. Trump said: Time is \u201ca very important magazine. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be on the cover many times this year and last year. \u201d But he added: \u201cWhen you say divided states of America, I didn\u2019t divide them. They\u2019re divided now. I mean there\u2019s a lot of division, and we\u2019re going to put it back together and we\u2019re going to have a country that\u2019s very well healed. \u201d It was unclear if Mr. Trump had seen the Time cover yet and knew that it was the magazine, and not Mr. Lauer, that had called the United States \u201cdivided. \u201d The magazine\u2019s annual selection is more of an exercise in   than covering the news, but Mr. Trump actually gave \u201cToday\u201d some news during the announcement. In a   interview, the   told Mr. Lauer that he expected to announce his choice for secretary of state next week. He also addressed his apparent decision in June  \u2014   announced on Tuesday  \u2014   to sell all of his stock holdings. Nancy Gibbs, Time\u2019s editor, said Mr. Trump\u2019s selection this year was \u201cone of the more straightforward\u201d choices the magazine had made. Mr. Trump has been on the magazine\u2019s cover many times in 2016 for features that were both positive and negative. In January, he called its profile of him \u201cone of the best I\u2019ve ever had. \u201d In August, Time featured an illustrated likeness of him melting down, as rumors swirled that his campaign was faltering two months later, it revisited that image to show him in full meltdown. Last year, Mr. Trump complained when Time chose Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and not him as its person of the year. \u201cThey picked the person who is ruining Germany,\u201d he said then. In 2013, he called its list of influential people \u201ca joke\u201d and said the magazine would soon fail. Time has occasionally chosen controversial figures, among them Adolf Hitler (in 1938) and Josef Stalin (twice: in 1939 and 1942). In 1969, it chose \u201cThe Middle Americans\u201d for the honor, celebrating them for continuing to pray in public schools in defiance of the United States Supreme Court and electing Richard M. Nixon (who himself would become the person of the year in 1971) to the White House. Nearly 40 years later, the magazine plastered a mirror on the cover of the magazine and named \u201cYou\u201d its person of the year for 2006. In 1982, there was a \u201cmachine of the year\u201d: the computer.'"}, "time": 1742562008.4618027}
