Gorka explained how some Trump officials could be targeted for political means under the current requirements for surveillance. \u201cLook, the president has been explicit here, Sean,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to allow the mandated authorities  \u2014   the congressional committees to do their work. We\u2019re not going to do witch hunts. That\u2019s what the left radical, progressive political elite does with their enemies. So, we\u2019re going to let the system deal with this as it should. \u201d \u201cBut again, your guests, I listen to your radio show as I was coming into the show today,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou had a former operative talk about how it\u2019s not rocket science to engineer a network analysis of telephone calls, who is calling who. If you want to attack me or Steve Bannon or Steve Miller or Kellyanne Conway, you say, \u2018Oh, they regularly call their nephew in Canada. Well, that\u2019s a foreigner. I don\u2019t need the same kind of intelligence authorities to intercept a foreign call. Then you start to find a way to unmask all of these conversations so that you can make political profit. That\u2019s a very, very tenable theory. And that\u2019s the kind of thing we have to find out if it was really happening. Because if that\u2019s the case, that is weaponizing intelligence for political purposes against your other party. \u201d When asked by Hannity how this compared to Watergate, Gorka suggested it paled in comparison. \u201cLosing 14 minutes of audiotape in comparison to this is a little spat in the sandbox in the kindergarten,\u201d Gorka replied.
