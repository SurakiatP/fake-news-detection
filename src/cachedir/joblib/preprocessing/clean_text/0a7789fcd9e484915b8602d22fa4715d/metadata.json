[The agency\u2019s inspector general found errors in how the government documented representative payees or individuals who are designated to receive retirement or disability benefits on behalf of those who cannot manage the benefits themselves, the Washington Free Beacon reported.  The audit, released Friday, found thousands of instances where no SSN was found on file. The agency paid $1 billion to 22, 426 representative payees who \u201cdid not have an SSN\u201d and had not kept any paper applications supporting an individual\u2019s case to receive benefits on someone else\u2019s behalf, according to the inspector general. \u201cFurthermore, unless it takes corrective action, we estimate SSA will pay about $182. 5 million in benefits, annually, to representative payees who do not have an SSN or paper application supporting their selection,\u201d the inspector general said. The agency also paid $853. 1 million in benefits since 2004 to individuals whom the agency terminated as representative payees. The inspector general said the errors occurred because the agency did not keep paper records of applications or purge terminated employees from the system. Of the audit\u2019s sample of 100 beneficiaries, only six SSN\u2019s were properly recorded. The inspector general also said that illegal aliens had been receiving benefits through the representative payee system. Illegal aliens without SSNs are allowed to receive government benefits if they are representing their minor children. In response to the audit, the SSA said that it switched to a new Electronic Representative Payee System last year, which \u201cmay have resulted in applications showing as terminated or not selected. \u201d The SSA defended its issuance of SSNs to   and   holders, saying, \u201cRepresentative payees play a significant role in many beneficiaries\u2019 lives. \u201d The agency added that the Social Security Act allows an illegal alien to serve as a payee. The \u201cabsence of an SSN is not a criterion preventing an individual from serving as payee,\u201d the agency added.'"}, "time": 1742628451.7589004}
