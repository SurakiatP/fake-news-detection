In the finals in Lyon, France, a group of 10 chefs and helpers from the United States won the gold medal. Norway took the silver medal, and Iceland won the bronze. In 2015 an American team was awarded the silver medal in the competition, which was founded by the French chef Paul Bocuse. Teams from 24 countries competed this year. \u201cI promised Monsieur Paul 10 years ago that we\u2019d make it to the top of the podium,\u201d said the chef Thomas Keller, who is the president of Team U. S. A. \u201cWe made it in nine. \u201d The team\u2019s head chef was Mathew Peters, 33, from Meadville, Pa. who was most recently the executive   of Mr. Keller\u2019s New York restaurant, Per Se. His commis, or helper, was Harrison Turone, 21, from Omaha, who also worked at Per Se. Both of the chefs took a year off to prepare for the contest, a fierce competition in which the American team is made up of younger chefs who can spare the time to train. Philip Tessier, a member of the team that won second place in 2015, was the Americans\u2019 coach. This year the chefs were required to prepare a meat platter and a vegan dish in 5 hours 35 minutes. \u201cWe had to use two proteins, Bresse chicken and crayfish,\u201d Mr. Peters said. \u201cAnd this was the first year there was a vegan dish. \u201d The teams were required to interpret \u201cPoulet de Bresse aux \u00c9crevisses,\u201d a Lyonnaise classic. The American version involved the chicken with morel mushroom sausage, braised wings, a wine glaze and sauce Am\u00e9ricaine, a kind of lobster sauce. Alongside were a chicken liver quenelle with foie gras, corn custard,   peas and toasted pistachios, as well as lobster tail with Meyer lemon mousse. The garnishes included preparations using carrots, Vidalia onions, black truffles, carrots, peas and potatoes. They brought some of the ingredients from the United States. For the vegan dish, the chefs prepared California asparagus with cremini mushrooms, potatoes, a custard made of green almonds, Meyer lemon confit, a Bordelaise sauce and a crumble using an almond and vegetable yeast preparation that mimicked Parmesan cheese. The team arrived in Lyon 10 days ago. After the winners were announced at 7:25 p. m. local time, Mr. Peters, who had been cooking since 8:40 a. m. said his energy was starting to come back. An estimated 300 American supporters were in the hall to cheer the team. Unlike some teams, the Americans were supported only by commercial sponsors and contributions, with no government funding. \u201cI don\u2019t think our government knows who we are,\u201d Mr. Keller said. Mr. Keller said he could not estimate how much participation in the contest cost. But he said that experience was essential. \u201cWe learned along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cOur win was built on the shoulders of a thousand people. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562094.3693361}
