He had been a bit difficult for us to locate since a   he helped organize for Donald J. Trump became an issue in the village\u2019s mayoral race. BOLINGBROOK, Ill.  \u2014  It was supposed to be an easy glide to yet another term for the longtime mayor of this suburb of Chicago. But then Mayor Claar helped throw the   and things got complicated. Jackie Traynere, 54, a labor organizer, is mounting an ambitious challenge against him. Here\u2019s the story of one village election on Tuesday that has become as much about Mr. Trump as the candidates on the ballot. \u2022 Ms. Traynere was so mad about the   event last fall that she decided to run against Mr. Claar. The Democratic apparatus in Illinois  \u2014   senators, members of Congress, you name it  \u2014   is lining up behind her. \u2022 Mayor Claar hadn\u2019t answered our interview requests, so we had been hoping to catch up with him Friday. \u2022 Finally, we talked with him at City Hall  \u2014   he does not regret the   though he has been disappointed by the reaction. Here\u2019s how the search unfolded. A little about Bolingbrook, 30 miles southwest of Chicago: About 74, 000 people live here and it\u2019s fairly diverse. The mayor\u2019s race is officially nonpartisan, and usually only several thousand people show up to vote. But with a challenger to Mr. Claar and all the attention on the race, this year could be different. The \u201cRog Mahal\u201d  \u2014   also known as the Bolingbrook Golf Club  \u2014   was the scene of the   for Mr. Trump. It was built by the city for $36 million in 2002, according to The Chicago Tribune, and many people in Bolingbrook see it as a sign of lavish excess. Mayor Claar\u2019s election HQ is along a stretch of strip shopping centers, tucked between an optometrist\u2019s office and a cellphone store. Campaign signs are plastered on the glass doors, and little wooden Uncle Sams decorate the entry. Three workers are milling around. One of them: the mayor\u2019s wife. Ms. Claar was polite but said she had nothing to add about how the campaign was going or why Mayor Claar might not want to meet. Onward. Around here, Mayor Claar has plenty of fans. Everyone seems to know him. He\u2019s been around through this village\u2019s expansion. Subdivisions have replaced cornfields. The population has almost doubled since 1990, and Mayor Claar has been there through it all. At Sophia\u2019s House of Pancakes, Ms. Traynere is meeting with supporters over club sandwiches and bowls of soup. She seems energetic and talks fast, but she also says she\u2019s starting to come down with a cold as her campaign reaches the homestretch. Her complaints about her competitor, the mayor? She says the village\u2019s debt is too high. She says he runs the whole village  \u2014   top to bottom  \u2014   and that he can be a \u201cbully. \u201d But most of all, she says the Trump event turned her stomach. \u201cTrump\u2019s own words,\u201d she says are what threw some residents here for a loop. Bolingbrook is 20 percent black, 25 percent Hispanic and 11 percent Asian  \u2014   a big change, she says, from when she was growing up here. \u201cThe way he talks about minorities,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s not what we experience in our community. That just doesn\u2019t jibe with our town. \u201d She goes on: \u201cWhen people realize that that was the mayor who brought him here, that definitely turned their head to think, \u2018hmm, maybe I ought to look at a few other things. \u2019\u201d But why is such an array of prominent Democrats lining up behind her for a little municipal race? Critics say it seems a bit much. Her supporters don\u2019t seem the least bit troubled by all the backing, though. They\u2019re thinking more about the mayor and the  . Off to City Hall  \u2014   we need to find Mayor Claar. After a wait in the lobby of Bolingbrook\u2019s municipal building, Mr. Claar suddenly appears in the doorway. Mayor Claar has gotten word of our search for him, and is actually clutching a printout of the story we have been writing today. For the record, he acknowledges that he has gotten our earlier phone messages and email requests for interviews, but says that he simply had not wished to talk to us. That said, he shows us to a conference room and patiently takes more than half an hour of questions. The mayor says that the   he helped throw for Mr. Trump is the essential reason that he finds himself with such a   race. He doesn\u2019t regret the  . Not at all, he says. But he adds: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that some people will take that one thing over 31 years and that\u2019s it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563141.745591}
