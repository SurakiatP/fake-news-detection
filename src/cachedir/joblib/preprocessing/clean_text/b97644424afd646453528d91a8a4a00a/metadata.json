The state, meaning the apparatus of government, is \\x93the system\\x94 that controls the American people.\\nMost people believe they control the political system through elections. Little do they know that the government and the corporate state own and control the state and the people. In other words, the system is rigged, as Donald Trump says . The system must keep this information invisible and it does so through constant conditioning of the public mind.\\nNow consider what has happened and is happening to Julian Assange. Consider Edward Snowden.\\nAssange created WikiLeaks in 2006, exposing, among other things, malfeasance in the conduct of Bush the Lesser\\x92s \\x93War on Terror.\\x94 Progressive Democrats loved Assange then.\\nBut by 2010, with George W. Bush out of power and Barack Obama continuing old wars and starting new ones, the truths that were being outed by WikiLeaks were hitting too close to home. WikiLeaks got its hands on a treasure trove of State Department and Pentagon emails and documents being dispatched across the globe.\\nI wrote at the time in \\x93 A war on the truth ,\\x94 that what WikiLeaks was revealing was:\\nthe result of a secretive, unaccountable and over-powerful government; a perfidious empire that seeks to rule the world by guile, cunning or force, if necessary. And the response by the United States government and by authorities in some of the U.S.\\x92s puppet states \\x97 like Great Britain, which arrested Assange, and Sweden, which brought spurious charges of rape against him \\x97 demonstrate the length the ruling elites will go to suppress the truth.\\nTruth is the enemy of a totalitarian regime. Fooling, lying, spying: That is the way of the totalitarian regime. Fooling, lying to and spying on friends and enemies, and even worse, its own citizens.\\nJust before I wrote that, we now know, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was contemplating various ways to shut WikiLeaks down. During a November meeting, sources say, Clinton suddenly blurted out, \\x93Can\\x92t we just drone this guy?\\x94\\nAccording to sources present at the meeting:\\nThe statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, \\x93walking around\\x94 freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States. Clinton was upset about Assange\\x92s previous 2010 records releases, divulging secret U.S. documents about the war in Afghanistan in July and the war in Iraq just a month earlier in October, sources said. At that time in 2010, Assange was relatively free and not living cloistered in in the embassy of Ecuador in London. Prior to 2010, Assange focused Wikileaks\\x92 efforts on countries outside the United States but now under Clinton and Obama, Assange was hammering America with an unparalleled third sweeping Wikileaks document dump in five months. Clinton was fuming, sources said, as each State Department cable dispatched during the Obama administration was signed by her.\\nClinton and other top administration officials knew the compromising materials warehoused in the CableGate stash would provide critics and foreign enemies with a treasure trove of counterintelligence. Bureaucratic fears about the CableGate release ultimately proved to be well founded by Clinton, her inner circle and her boss in the White House.\\nEfforts to shut down WikiLeaks included an American intelligence-initiated operation to entrap Assange in a phony rape charge. The U.S. government also pressured PayPal, VISA and MasterCard to shut down donations to WikiLeaks. The Swedish bank handling Assange\\x92s legal defense fund was pressured by the U.S. government to freeze the account. The firm hosting WikiLeaks\\x92 website was pressured to shut the site the down.\\nNow WikiLeaks is revealing widespread corruption, vote rigging, media manipulation and other damning evidence against the Democrat Party, Hillary Clinton and her minions. WikiLeaks and Assange are prying the lid off the propaganda machine and exposing the corrupt system.\\nIn response, U.S. intelligence (an oxymoron) initiated another effort to entrap Assange in a sex-related scandal; this time by connecting him with a phony \\x93dating site\\x94 and alleging he solicited sex with an 8-year-old girl.\\nJohn Kerry\\x92s State Department pressured Ecuador to cut off Assange\\x92s internet connection. There is a new move afoot to figure a way to pry him out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and turn him over to U.S. authorities, where he will no doubt disappear into the bowels of indefinite detention.\\nOnly the power of propaganda keeps the people from overthrowing the U.S. government by force. So truth is the enemy of the state and the state will do everything it can to suppress it.\\nThat\\x92s not surprising. What is surprising is the vast number of people on both \\x93sides\\x94 of the political spectrum outside of government who see truth seekers and truth disseminators like Assange, Snowden and Bradley Manning as enemies rather than friends of liberty.'"}, "time": 1742561768.0891168}
