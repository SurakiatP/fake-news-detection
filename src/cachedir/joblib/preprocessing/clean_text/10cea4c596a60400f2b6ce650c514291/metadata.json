S. citizens were armed to repel a tyranny. Senator Ted Cruz ( ) stressed this message when reminding NRA members why the right to keep and bear arms is so important. Cruz said: When the Second Amendment was drafted it wasn\u2019t about hunting. Hunting is a lot of fun. In Texas I enjoy hunting. Target shooting is great fun. The Second Amendment is not about target shooting either. The reason the Second Amendment is in the Bill of Rights is because the Second Amendment reflects the fundamental right of each and every one of us to protect our homes and our families and our children from anyone that would seek to do them harm. And the Second Amendment was also designed as a check on government tyranny. That an armed citizenry is a free and independent citizenry empowered to defend our fundamental liberties. Cruz\u2019s words are a reflection of James Madison\u2019s message in Federalist 46, wherein Madison explained that Americans are exceptional because armed, and the citizens\u2019 right to bear arms ensures that they can band together to repel tyranny from an overreaching central government. Looked at in another light, Frum\u2019s tweet is reminiscent of the kind of haughty statements made by British military leadership during the American Revolution. After all, that was a war in which new world colonists \u2014  largely unorganized and without military training, particularly in the South \u2014  rose up to defeat a   and fully militarized British Army. Their motivation was freedom through victory they were determined to cast off the yoke of King George III, with its myriad taxations and the subsequent deprivation of liberty. The NRA\u2019s fight is likewise a fight for freedom \u2014  and it is one they are winning. Commentators like Frum and   despots who believe the American people are willing to trade their freedom for an overbearing government have missed, not only the last 10 years of the NRA\u2019s expansion in members and power, but   American gun owners\u2019 determination to live in liberty\u2019s shadow.
