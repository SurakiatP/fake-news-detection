Trump\u2019s biggest concern about his convention speech was how much to reveal about himself and his family in an address that is often the most personal one a presidential candidate delivers. But the political firestorm over his wife\u2019s speech, which borrowed passages from Michelle Obama\u2019s convention remarks in 2008, raised the stakes exponentially. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Thursday night cannot merely be his best ever. It also has to be bulletproof. By Tuesday morning, word had spread throughout his campaign that any language in Mr. Trump\u2019s address even loosely inspired by speeches, essays, books or Twitter posts had to be either rewritten or attributed. Mr. Trump\u2019s chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, reassured colleagues that the acceptance speech was wholly original, according to two staff members who spoke with him and described those conversations on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Miller also told campaign aides that he had looked closely at passages that Mr. Trump had contributed  \u2014   handwritten on unlined white pages  \u2014   and was confident they contained no problems. (Mr. Miller declined an interview request.) Even so, one of the staff members downloaded   software and ran a draft of the speech through the program. No red flags came up. The intense scrutiny of Mr. Trump\u2019s words added new pressure to a speechwriting process that has been one of the most unpredictable and   in modern presidential campaigns. A month ago, Mr. Trump began giving dictation on themes for the speech, and he tossed ideas and phrases to Mr. Miller or other advisers on a daily basis. On printed copies of each draft, he circled passages he liked, crossed out or put question marks beside lines that he did not favor and frequently suggested new words or phrases. \u201cI\u2019ve been amending the drafts \u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview in his Manhattan office before the convention. \u201cI get ideas from a lot of different places, a lot of smart people, but mostly I like language that sounds like me. \u201d Yet in the aftermath of Melania Trump\u2019s speech, campaign advisers have fretted that they do not know for sure where Mr. Trump gets his ideas and language  \u2014   whether they are his own, in other words, or are picked up from Twitter, television, or, say, a best seller by Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News, a commentator whom Mr. Trump likes. Borrowing or adapting may not always be tantamount to plagiarism, but several Trump advisers, who also insisted on anonymity, said that after the furor over Ms. Trump\u2019s remarks, the campaign cannot allow a similar blowup. Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist who is advising a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Trump, said that the candidate could not afford any mistakes. \u201cHis speech is the whole game,\u201d Mr. Rollins said. \u201cViewers have to watch it and say, \u2018There is the next president of the United States. \u2019\u201d In the interview, Mr. Trump said his speech would center on his vision of a strong and secure America that \u201conce existed and no longer does, but can again under a Trump administration. \u201d His greatest challenge, he said, was \u201cputting myself in the speech\u201d  \u2014   discussing his upbringing and early experiences and relating them to the hopes and aspirations of other Americans. \u201cI was never comfortable getting personal about my family because I thought it was special territory,\u201d Mr. Trump said, glancing at a picture of his father on his desk. \u201cIt can feel exploitative to use family stories to win votes. And I had a very happy and comfortable life growing up. I had a great relationship with my father. But my focus needs to be on all the Americans who are struggling. \u201d He said he was unsure if he would discuss his older brother Fred, who died as an alcoholic in 1981 at 43  \u2014   and whom he has described as an example of how destructive choices can damage lives that seem golden. \u201cWithout my brother Fred I might not be here,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe was really smart,  . I don\u2019t drink or smoke because of what happened to him. I focused on building my business and making good choices. I may talk about that, but I don\u2019t know if I should. \u201d Acceptance speeches seldom seem complete without anecdotes about personal trials and triumphs: Mitt Romney, trying to persuade voters to see him as more than a rich businessman, devoted about a fourth of his 2012 address to his parents\u2019 unconditional love, his Mormon faith and reminiscences about watching the moon landing. In 2008, Barack Obama described how his grandfather benefited from the G. I. Bill and how his mother and grandmother taught him the value of hard work. And Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 speech vividly recalled the life lessons he learned from his mother about fighting and working hard, from his grandfather about racial equality  \u2014   and from his wife, Hillary, who, Mr. Clinton said, taught him that every child could learn. Mr. Clinton finished his speech with a   line tying his Arkansas hometown to the American dream. \u201cI end tonight where it all began for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI still believe in a place called Hope. \u201d James Carville, a senior strategist for Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, said that if Mr. Trump hoped to change the minds of those who see him as divisive or bigoted, he would need to open himself up to voters in meaningfully personal ways in his speech. \u201cIf he\u2019s really different than the way he seems in television interviews or at his rallies, Thursday\u2019s speech will be his single greatest opportunity to show voters who he really is,\u201d Mr. Carville said. Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, said that Thursday\u2019s speech would be \u201cvery much a reflection of Mr. Trump\u2019s own words, as opposed to remarks that others create and the campaign puts in his mouth. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not an editor  \u2014   he is actually the creator of the speech,\u201d Mr. Manafort said. \u201cMr. Trump has given Steve Miller and I very specific directions about how he views the speech, what he wants to communicate, and ways to tie together things that he has been talking about in the campaign. The speech will end up being   because the speech\u2019s words will be his words. \u201d Mr. Trump prefers speaking off the cuff with handwritten notes, a style that has proved successful at his rallies, where he has shown a talent for connecting with and electrifying crowds. But his adjustment to formal speeches remains a work in progress: He does not always sound like himself, and reading from a text can detract from the sense of authenticity that his supporters prize. One question is whether, or how much, he will  . He has sometimes seemed unable to resist deviating from prepared remarks, often to ill effect  \u2014   ranting about a mosquito, or joking that a passing airplane was from Mexico and was \u201cgetting ready to attack. \u201d \u201c  is instinct, all instinct,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI thought maybe about doing a freewheeling speech for the convention, but that really wouldn\u2019t work. But even with a teleprompter, the speech will be me  \u2014   my ideas, my beliefs, my words. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564138.7422678}
