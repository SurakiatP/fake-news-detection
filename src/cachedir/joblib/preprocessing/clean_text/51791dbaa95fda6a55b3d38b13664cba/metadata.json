Its Juno spacecraft made its fifth      dive of Jupiter on March 27, its eight instruments gathering data on the planet\u2019s interior as it accelerated to 129, 000 miles per hour. On each flyby, the public nominates and then votes on the atmospheric features Juno\u2019s camera should record. This time, one of the winning targets was a boundary between two atmospheric regions. The bluish streak on the right is part of a persistent storm. Juno snapped this image 7, 900 miles from the planet. This week, NASA released an image of Jupiter taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which is in orbit around Earth. The distance, 415 million miles, is the closest that Earth gets to Jupiter, which makes it a good time for Hubble to perform a    survey of the solar system\u2019s largest planet. The space telescope is able to discern features on Jupiter as small as 80 miles across. \u201cWe can map out the full planet,\u201d said Amy A. Simon, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. who led the observations. \u201cOn a first glance, the Great Red Spot is still strikingly colored. It stands out quite well. \u201d Dr. Simon said that Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere appears to be more turbulent than in the past couple of years. \u201cThat\u2019s telling us something about the deeper atmosphere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be analyzing this over the next few months. \u201d Because the Hubble observations roughly coincided with Juno\u2019s flyby, scientists will be able to match the   with a wider view of the planet. \u201cWe could do a    there and help out Juno at the same time,\u201d Dr. Simon said.'"}, "time": 1742561718.7063396}
