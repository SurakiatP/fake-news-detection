WikiLeaks also released many thousands of emails taken from Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state serving under President Obama. \\nThe credibility of the emails has been occasionally questioned. Indeed, even if the organization only received and hacked actual emails and the like that had actually come from Democratic Party officials. WikiLeaks was still found, on multiple occasions, to have been improperly spinning the email contents. Such as the time a mundane email about then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s UN translation providing earpiece, was spun into a fake story about Clinton using an earpiece to be fed what she was supposed to say. \\nTrump is far from predictable enough for any observer to definitively suggest his course of action regarding Assange once he takes office. He continues to surround himself with figures ranging from \u201clevel-headed,\u201d establishment conservatives like Reince Priebus, to the far right controversial at best conservative media guru Steve Bannon.
