C. at the Partnership for a Healthier American 2017 Healthier Future Summit, former first lady Michelle Obama blasted \u201cpartisan\u201d critics of her 2010 \u201cLet\u2019s Move!\u201d program to combat childhood obesity, which included regulations on school lunch programs. [Obama said, \u201cSo we have a lot more work to do for sure but we got to make sure we don\u2019t let anybody take us back. Because the question is where are we going back to? I mean this is where you really have to look at motives. You have to stop and think, why don\u2019t you want our kids to have good food at school?  \u201cWhat is wrong with you? And why is that a partisan issue? Why would that be political? What is going on? Now that is up to moms. I\u2019m talking to moms, think about this, take me out of the equation, like me, don\u2019t like me, but think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap? Why would you celebrate that? Why would you sit idly and be okay with that? \u201d \u2018Cause here\u2019s the secret, If somebody is doing that, they don\u2019t care about your kids. And we need to demand everyone to care deeply about our kids. \u201d (  NTK) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN,  '"}, "time": 1742564555.4294224}
