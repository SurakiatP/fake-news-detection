Trump also told the German daily Bild that Kushner has \u201can innate ability to make deals. \u201d \u201cJared is such a good lad, he will secure an Israel deal which no one else has managed to get. You know, he\u2019s a natural talent, he is the top, he is a natural talent,\u201d he added, according to a translation from the Guardian. In the past, Trump has hinted that tapping Kushner for the role was a natural choice, saying his    \u201cknows the region, knows the people, knows the players. \u201d Kushner was the chief speech writer for Trump\u2019s address to Israel lobby AIPAC, and had a hand in Trump\u2019s foreign policy throughout his campaign. Israeli ministers have hailed the prospect of Kushner as peace broker. \u201cWe would be so happy if someone could bring peace to the Middle East. We welcome him,\u201d Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said last month. Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman echoed Hotevely, saying, \u201cWhat we know, he\u2019s a really tough, smart guy, and we hope he will bring new energy to our region. \u201d Kushner and his wife, Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, are Orthodox Jews. Speaking to Bild, Trump slammed the Obama administration\u2019s decision to forego the U. S. veto on an   UN Security Council resolution as \u201cterrible. \u201d He added that he hoped Britain would use its veto against any additional resolution in the next few days, saying he wasn\u2019t sure the U. S. would play ball despite Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s assurances to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during Sunday\u2019s peace summit in Paris that the Obama administration would prevent further action at the UN. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the U. S. would do so  \u2014   extraordinarily enough. They won\u2019t do it, right? Do you believe the U. S. will place a veto?\u201d he said, according to the Guardian\u2019s translation. \u201cI have Jewish friends who organized a donor event for Obama. I say to them: \u2018What on earth are you doing? Okay  \u2014   what are you doing? \u2019\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742561808.743745}
