[A YouGov poll shows that CNN falls behind MSNBC and Fox News in brand perception, the Daily Caller reports.  The poll asked respondents, \u201cIf you\u2019ve heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, was it positive or negative?\u201d Of the three cable networks, Fox News was the only network to score a neutral brand perception. CNN and MSNBC both scored negative on brand perception. \u201cCNN\u2019s negative acceleration point happened in   2016, around the time Anderson Cooper interviewed Melania Trump, notably discussing her husband\u2019s famous \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape,\u201d YouGov\u2019s Ted Marzilli notes. \u201cAlso at that time, a local North Carolina Republican office was firebombed, causing   media to pounce on CNN for suggesting Trump\u2019s rhetoric spurred the incident. \u201d Marzilli adds that particular news events and President Trump\u2019s bashing of the network\u2019s news coverage have taken a toll on CNN. Trump has consistently called CNN \u201cfake news,\u201d along with the New York Times, for its    coverage of his administration and its penchant for making several mistakes when reporting on the administration: FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn\u2019t tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017,  On Tuesday, CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta inaccurately claimed that Trump made no mention of the \u201cadministrative state\u201d in his speech to a joint session of Congress. Trump alluded to the \u201cadministrative state\u201d while talking about his lobbying ban for executive branch officials and hiring freeze for   federal government workers. CNN dedicated much airtime in January to memos alleging that Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was in communication with Russian officials. The reports turned out to be false.'"}, "time": 1742563317.035367}
