Thomas Hauser\u2019s \u201cMuhammad Ali: His Life and Times\u201d was another superb book about the singular, most-globally-recognized athlete of all time and, again, an athlete from the era in which I was raised. \\nHowever, the REAL text books were books like \u201cThe Four Agreements\u201d by Don Miguel Ruiz, \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d by Eckhart Tolle, and \u201cConversations with God, Book 1\u201d by Neale Donald Walsch, all of which dealt with the human spirit and personal struggle. \\nHowever, in the world of business and markets, the books which are always within arm reach are, in order of least-to-most importance, \u201cThe Battle for Investment Survival\u201d by Gerald M. Loeb (1935), \u201cReminiscences of a Stock Operator\u201d by Lefevre and Lowenstein (1923), \u201c Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World\u201d by Michael Lewis (2011), \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d by Ayn Rand (1957) and finally \u201cWhen Money Dies: The Nightmare of the Weimar Collapse\u201d by Adam Fergusson (1975). \\nAs a snapshot of the societal impact of the Great Keynesian Experiment through which are currently traversing, \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d tells you EXACTLY where we are today complete with gutted-out American manufacturing and massive corruption, intervention, and interference brought about by the odious partnership between government and the elite 1%. The one book that describes the probable outcome of all of the money-printing ($57 trillion) of the post-2008-meltdown era is \u201cWhen Money Dies: The Nightmare of the Weimar Collapse\u201d and it is this book that is sitting under the desk phone in my office. \\nThe last paragraph sums it all up with the following ghastly summary: \u201cIn hyperinflation, a kilo of potatoes was worth, to some, more than the family silver; a side of pork more than a grand piano. A prostitute in the family was better than an infant corpse; theft was preferable to starvation; warmth was finer than honour; clothing more essential than democracy, food more needed than freedom.\u201d THAT paragraph is like \u201cThe Ghost of Christmas Yet-To-Come\u201d in Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d and it is truly frightening. \\nThe use of history books is, for me, a necessity and the following two quotes are the reasons why: \\n\u201cHistory never repeats itself but it rhymes.\u201d \u2013 Mark Twain . \\nand, \\n\u201cThose who cannot remember the past doomed to repeat it.\u201d \u2013 George Santayana \\nIn the bigger picture concerning the global capital markets, I see enormous changes coming and it is all laid out in front of us like those little solar lights that illuminate the path from my deck down to the water on a very dark night. In \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d Ayn Rand describes what America would look like when the business \u201celite\u201d finally own the government and legislature and the justice system. Nothing is more relevant than looking at the events that have transpired since the Financial Crisis of 2008 that didn\u2019t \u201cnearly\u201d take down the financial system; it DID take it down but criminal collusion manufactured the bail-out mechanism that allowed it to continue to function in \u201cWalking Dead\u201d fashion. \\nAll you need to do is look at Deutsche Bank to witness all of the same insanity, greed and aberrant behaviors that were so very prominent among the bankster crowd of 2004\u20132008 being replayed here in 2016 by the German\u2019s beloved DB . \\nIn \u201cBoomerang\u201d, Michael Lewis walks us through the mindsets of the European bankers and politicians and especially the citizenry, whose contempt for the former two is most acute in Ireland, where one might have thought a few of them might have been carted off to jail. \\nHowever, nothing can send chills up and down your spine more than the last of my list, \u201cWhen Money Dies.\u201d We have all heard stories about the Weimar hyperinflation and how the indiscriminate albeit well-intended printing of \u201cReich marks\u201d sent post WWI Germany into chaos and bedlam and unimaginable human suffering. \\n\u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d describes the environment created BY the crime; Michael Lewis walks us through the incredible sense of entitlement among the populist movement responding TO the crime; but Adam Fergusson paints a horrific portrait of the outcome OF the crime. It is a \u201cmust-read\u201d for everyone that is playing around with stocks and bonds or trying to manage \u201cCash\u201d these days. Can\u2019t happen here in \u201cthe modern world\u201d? Well, it is happening right now as we speak in Venezuela where prison inmates have been resorting to cannibalism due to dire food shortages and government corruption. \\nI write all of this nonsense because as a former resident of the U.S., I was there for the Watergate hearings; I watched Nixon resign; I watched Jimmy Carter have his legacy tarnished by an Arab oil embargo, 12% inflation, massive line-ups at the gas pumps and a hostage crisis. I watched Presidential campaigns in 1972 and 1976 first-hand and have always paid a great deal of attention since. The bare facts behind this year\u2019s race are ugly; you have two candidates that are equally annoying, unequivocally flawed and universally repulsed by the vast majority of voters. \\nWhat hits me between the eyes is that for the first time in history, we are witnessing a race so thoroughly \u201cun-presidential\u201d that it resembles a WWF wrestling match complete with enough \u201csmackdowns\u201d and \u201cwhup-ass\u201d remarks to put Vince McMahon to shame. \\nThe global champion of democracy and capitalism, apple pie and Apple Computer now has the entire world looking on in fear and disbelief that either one of these two candidates could have access to the launch codes that could vaporize the entire planet in a heartbeat all because of a bad meal or a particularly stressful day. The days of Ronald Reagan running the country as Chairman of the Board are now over. And that, my friends, is not only sad; it is outright disturbing. \\nSo the U.S. dollar continues to roll higher and the gold market struggles to right itself against FOREX headwinds. The U.S. dollar responds to the pre-election tape-painting and the broadly-based consensus that once the election is over that the Fed will hike rates and send the USD index to 105. \\nHowever, given that I don\u2019t care a great deal for technical analysis, here is a Wiki snapshot of a classic \u201cGravestone Doji\u201d that indicates that a trend may be coming to an end. \\nNow take a look at the chart of the U.S. dollar index ($USD) that has finally turned up with a big Gravestone Doji to cap the current rally off the May, June and August lows, setting things up for another metals advance into year-end. \\nNow, we saw a Gravestone Doji a few months back in the HUI (NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index) around 175 but it decided to advance another 100 points before correcting, so don\u2019t get too excited (or committed) with this one for the USD. I only mention it because the USD is not as illiquid as the global gold market because the Americans have printed TRILLIONS of USDs since 2008 so it is not nearly as easy to manipulate FOREX as it is gold. Ergo, technical analysis works for the USD and it is useless for gold\u2014period. \\nI reported to you all that I had re-entered the GDXJ (VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF) position on October 13 th and added more on Friday the 14 th when I suddenly realized that I was far too complacent with the decaying currency sitting in my trading account. I was growing miserable, snarly, inattentive, and argumentative without my beloved GDXJ position and it was truly difficult to function. \\nThose around me were so happy to see me take my enormous profit on GDXJ and were more than happy with the new drapes and the new leash and the Gourmet Alpo and the \u201cdesigner doggie bags,\u201d but I now know that they thought of me as \u201cseriously depressed.\u201d I am now no longer upset and I am no longer depressed as I now own every single wonderfully decadent share of the GDXJ that I owned back in late 2015 when the junior miners were being shorted and sold by every HFT algorithm and every desk trader and every CNBC-following doorknob on the planet. \\nNow, for the traders out there? I have a sell order in for 50% of the GDXJ position at $45.00. If filled, we will own the remaining 50% at new breakeven cost of $32.20 at which point I sit back and chill. No reason to particularly worry with such a wonderful adjusted cost. \\nNow, most of you are dying to know how a) Stakeholder Gold Corp.\u2019s (SRC:TSX.V) Ballarat RAB drilling program is progressing and b) when the Canuc Resources Ltd. (CDA:TSX.V) /Santa Rosa RTO will be completed. Last update for the Yukon was yesterday and the first seven RAB holes are now en route to the assay lab in Whitehorse where the turnaround should be 10-14 days. SRC CEO Chris Berlet and V.P. Exploration John Nebocat are in Dawson City today travelling to the property for a day full of comprehensive interpretation and analysis. I would expect a drilling update upon their return. I could talk all day about the large intercepts of quartz sericite alteration and the density of the rock they are encountering but until the assays are back from Whitehorse, it is pretty much meaningless. \\nI have been asked about the seasonality effect and the lack of news flow during the long Yukon winter and whether or not it will affect the stock price performance. The fact that SRC will have a full treasury after all 2016 exploration bills are paid allows a generous amount of working capital to be allocated to marketing. Since getting the story \u201cout\u201d is crucial to the survival of all junior miners, SRC has already secured a booth at the January 2017 Vancouver Resource Investment Conference and will be doing the same for PDAC in Toronto in March. While that is all fine and dandy, it is obviously imperative that SRC has a decent tailwind from positive assay results coming off the 2016 program. \\nAs for the Canuc/Santa Rosa RTO, all I can say is that every RTO to which I have been privy over the years takes longer than first thought and this one is no different. Between the lawyers and the regulators, it seems that just when you think you are getting the green light, they come up with something ridiculous like translating a document that is 15 years old from Spanish to English \u201cin order to protect the poor minority shareholders of Canuc Resources.\u201d In reality, all that needs to happen is for Canuc shareholders to vote on the transaction. It is they that are getting absorbed by the private company (Santa Rosa Silver Mining Corp.) so why not just ask them if they are OK with the terms of the deal and drive on? Alas, despite the delay, I simply cannot stand the wait as the Santa Rosa project will be a beauty. (If anyone wants to have a look at the old PowerPoint presentation that was used back in 2015, email me at [email protected] .) \\nOnly two more weeks until the elections are over and then it should be a \u201cSell the news\u201d scenario for the USD and that should provide the impetus for a sizzling year-end rally in the metals. Then, as 2016 ticks down, and with so many money managers having missed the gold rally, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there is a mid-December scramble for the mining shares and/or physical gold and silver as year-end window dressing is applied to \u201cmodern portfolio management.\u201d \\nRight. . . \\nOriginally trained during the inflationary 1970s, Michael Ballanger is a graduate of Saint Louis University where he earned a Bachelor of Science in finance and a Bachelor of Art in marketing before completing post-graduate work at the Wharton School of Finance.
