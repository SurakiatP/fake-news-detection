Gen. Prayuth   the junta chief and prime minister, hinted that the perpetrators were \u201cbad people\u201d opposed to a new Constitution that was approved by voters on Sunday in a nationwide referendum. \u201cThere are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the referendum,\u201d he said in an address to the nation. The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, areas popular with tourists, killed four people and wounded dozens. The authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related. Analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many, but rather at damaging the tourism industry, a bright spot in Thailand\u2019s economy. \u201cWhatever the motives are, the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta\u2019s claim that the   situation would be stable,\u201d said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThese attacks create effects that discredit the authorities, terrorize the public and harm the   economy. \u201d The police have portrayed the attacks as \u201clocal sabotage,\u201d not as terrorism. The timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism. The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother\u2019s Day in Thailand. Four bombs struck the royal residential town of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok. The police there detained two men for questioning on Friday in connection with the attacks, Reuters reported. The   Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control. The junta ensured its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it. Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted the military\u2019s suspicion that the attacks had been carried out by people disgruntled over the vote. The bombings were \u201cclearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries,\u201d he said. Last year, a bombing in Bangkok killed 20, most of them tourists from China. Thai officials attributed the bombing to Uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China. General Prayuth, who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government, said this week\u2019s bombings \u201churt the hearts\u201d of the Thai people. \u201cWhy now, when the country is getting better, the economy is getting better, and tourism is getting better?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to ask why, and who did it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562324.8443284}
