In the song, after meeting a girl, he tries talking her up. \u201cI\u2019m from New York,\u201d he tells her. \u201cShe like my accent. \u201d That the tongue of New York  \u2014   the birthplace of    \u2014   would be anything but the genre\u2019s normative voice is a reality that local rappers have been ignoring for years now, even as rap\u2019s center abandoned this city for ones far away: Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and beyond. New York is rap\u2019s ancestral home, and also, it turns out, home to its greatest stylistic conservatives, stubbornly standing their ground while the crowds disperse. And yet New York retains a sort of mystique: To become the sound of the city still feels like a    goal. But for more than a decade, such consensus has been tough to come by  \u2014   every attempt at a new New York style was greeted with skepticism and reluctance. A Boogie may have cracked the code. \u201cI think about it a lot every day,\u201d he said one evening last week. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for things right now in my city. It\u2019s a lot of pressure. \u201d The    rapper was in the back seat of a black S. U. V. slowly making its way around Highbridge, a geographically isolated corner of the southwest Bronx where he was born and largely raised. Every now and again, he would open up the window to call out to an old friend or point to a personal landmark and tell a story. Over there, an apartment building where he used to record in a closet. A couple of blocks away, a stoop on which he wrote the lyrics for \u201cBando,\u201d one of his hits. When the driver tried to turn onto one busy block, A Boogie stopped him: \u201cThis is the bad block right here,\u201d he said. At the beginning of this year, A Boogie  \u2014   born Artist Dubose  \u2014   was still a fixture in this neighborhood. But on Valentine\u2019s Day, he released his debut mixtape, \u201cArtist,\u201d full of songs that merged sensitivity and bluster delivered in strident,   melodies. By this summer, a handful of his tracks  \u2014   \u201cFriend Zone,\u201d the tough \u201cBando,\u201d the breezy \u201cMy ______\u201d  \u2014   had become fixtures on New York radio and made A Boogie the most promising young rapper the city has produced in some time. He has found a way to make a New York rap sound that\u2019s modern, not preoccupied with the formalist bullies of the 1990s (the L. O. X. DMX) that still define the city to so many. A few times in recent years, new New York sounds arrived and threatened upheaval: ASAP Rocky\u2019s polyregionalism, French Montana\u2019s morbid celebrations, the occasional \u201cChicken Noodle Soup\u201d novelty. But A Boogie\u2019s sound acknowledges the youthful power of the internet and the   inclusion of melody in   while still being rooted in   New York roughneck business. \u201cThere\u2019s so few New York movements  \u2014   we\u2019ve got to be a part of this one,\u201d said Craig Kallman, the chairman and chief executive of Atlantic Records, who signed Highbridge the Label, A Boogie\u2019s label, to a joint venture. Several of the songs on \u201cArtist\u201d were inspired by a rocky situation with a girlfriend, including a pregnancy scare. While writing about that experience, A Boogie began experimenting with how to best manipulate his voice, landing on a creaky, sweet, melodic style delivered with a bruiser\u2019s cadence. \u201cI was always scared to use that around people,\u201d he said. \u201cEven to this day, I\u2019m still developing my voice. I used it again in a different type of mood song, like a hood song, and it sounded crazy again and I was like, \u2018Damn, this is the voice right here.\u2019 It made me want to do mad music in different moods. \u201d That\u2019s meant flexibility in approach: sometimes his most rugged subject matter  \u2014   on \u201cArtist,\u201d and also \u201cHighbridge the Label: The Takeover Vol. 1,\u201d the mixtape he released in May with his labelmate Don Q  \u2014   comes in the softest voice, and vice versa. If there is a New York legacy A Boogie belongs to, it is perhaps the long tail of the era of   gangsters, from Biggie Smalls and the Bad Boy label to the days of 50 Cent and Ja Rule. Still, Mr. Kallman noted, \u201cI don\u2019t think necessarily the focus on the history is essential. \u201d Besides, it is a promising moment for young New York rappers, from A Boogie and Don Q to sly ruffians like Young M. A. to sharp lyricists like Dave East. Indeed, A Boogie\u2019s rise has been almost completely    \u2014   reminiscent of Bobby Shmurda\u2019s rapid ascent in 2014, but without a dance to encourage virality. He began by posting songs on Soundcloud, and also Facebook, where he would ask fans who liked samples of his songs if he could tag them when the full version was released. That became a sort of street marketing team. Soon after he released \u201cArtist,\u201d he first heard one of his songs on Hot 97, the venerated New York radio station, while he happened to be streaming on Facebook Live. By April, he performed a   show at B. B. King Blues Club  Grill. Around that time, he began a string of club performances alongside the Hot 97   D. J. and longtime New York rap agitator Funkmaster Flex, who first learned about A Boogie from the bloggers on his website, and from requests in Bronx nightclubs. \u201cFor the first time in a while, that New York sound, people are looking to put in their clubs up and down the East Coast,\u201d Funkmaster Flex said, before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush anything and say we\u2019re back. I don\u2019t want to jinx it. \u201d When A Boogie was young, he said, he sold marijuana \u201cto get the money to get to the studio. \u201d After getting in trouble as a teenager, he and his family relocated to Florida, where he was arrested at least five times, on charges including burglary and drug possession. (\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt nobody,\u201d he said.) His last year there, he was on house arrest, though he would sneak out to work with a local producer. He returned to Highbridge last summer, but a few months ago moved to a house in Westchester, and more recently, to one in New Jersey, which he shares with Don Q and the label\u2019s owners, QP and Bubba. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hate,\u201d he said. \u201cNot in the neighborhood, but outside the neighborhood, and people bring that over here. I don\u2019t never know who\u2019s out here no more. \u201d A few weeks ago, one of his friends was shot and killed in the neighborhood. \u201cI felt like it could have been me,\u201d he said. Around the same time, he performed onstage with Drake during three consecutive shows at Madison Square Garden. After the visit to Highbridge, A Boogie\u2019s S. U. V. made its way to Blast Off Productions near Times Square, a tiny hotbox of a studio with Drake platinum plaques on the lobby wall and speakers strong enough to shake the doors. Even though he was feeling under the weather, he bought a box of Raw rolling papers in the smoke shop downstairs, then headed upstairs for a recording session. After a quick meal from Steak \u2019n Shake, A Boogie began rolling up some weed in the lobby while in the background, a surly beat throbbed. Soon he began singing in that appealingly cracked voice: He mumbled a few musical phrases to himself, then tried a couplet: \u201cRight when you thought that I was so  \u2019s when you turned me into a savage,\u201d lingering over the vowel sounds and pushing his voice even further into scratched territory. \u201cI ain\u2019t wanna make that type of song just now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy today. \u201d But the beat was putting him in a different head space, and squeezing out a different voice. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get back in that bag, talk about my feelings,\u201d he said, then closed his eyes and found the melody.'"}, "time": 1742563363.7243164}
