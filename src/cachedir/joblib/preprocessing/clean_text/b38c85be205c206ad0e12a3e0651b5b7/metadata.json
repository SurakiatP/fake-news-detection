[Speaking from President Trump\u2019s    estate in Florida, where Trump is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tillerson referenced Russia\u2019s 2013 agreement to oversee the destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical arsenal and said Russia has \u201cclearly failed in its responsibility\u201d to eliminate those weapons.  \u201cEither Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,\u201d he said. Tillerson stated that Russia\u2019s permission was not sought for the strike, but warnings were given to reduce the risk of Russian casualties. \u201cOur target in this attack was not Russia. Our target was this airfield and the Syrian regime. \u201d He also said the White House consulted with American allies in Europe and the Middle East, and their response was \u201coverwhelmingly supportive. \u201d \u201cI think it does demonstrate that President Trump is willing to act when governments and government actors cross the line,\u201d Tillerson said of the U. S. military action. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that President Trump made that statement to the world tonight. \u201d NBC News notes that Tillerson is scheduled to fly to Moscow next week \u201cfor   meetings with Russian officials on a trip originally intended to turn a new page in the U. S. Russian relationship. \u201d With masterful understatement, a senior State Department official said the Syrian situation was certain to \u201ccolor\u201d Tillerson\u2019s talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov provided some of that color on Friday, by stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cconsiders the U. S. strikes against Syria an aggression against a sovereign country violating the norms of international law, and under a   pretext at that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562248.0386953}
