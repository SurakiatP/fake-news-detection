So when a visitor recently asked an     in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew Ona Judge, the woman didn\u2019t miss a beat. Judge\u2019s escape from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796 had been \u201ca great embarrassment to General and Lady Washington,\u201d the woman said, before offering her own view of the matter. \u201cOna was born free, like everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was this world that made her a slave. \u201d It\u2019s always 1799 at Mount Vernon, where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before Washington\u2019s death, when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves. That liberation did not apply to Ona Judge, one of 153 slaves held by Martha Washington. But Judge, it turned out, evaded the Washingtons\u2019 dogged (and sometimes illegal) efforts to recapture her, and would live quietly in New Hampshire for another 50 years. Now her story  \u2014   and the challenge it offers to the notion that Washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding  \u2014   is having its fullest airing yet. Judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in \u201cLives Bound Together: Slavery at George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon,\u201d the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic. She is also the subject of a book, \u201cNever Caught: The Washingtons\u2019 Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge,\u201d by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. Most scholars who have written about Judge\u2019s escape have used it as a lens onto Washington\u2019s evolving ideas about slavery. But \u201cNever Caught,\u201d published on Tuesday by 37 Ink, flips the perspective, focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage. \u201cWe have the famous fugitives, like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass,\u201d Ms. Dunbar, a professor of black studies and history at the University of Delaware, said in an interview in Mount Vernon\u2019s    food court. \u201cBut decades before them, Ona Judge did this. I want people to know her story. \u201d Research on slavery has exploded in the two decades since Mount Vernon, Monticello and other founder home sites introduced   tours and other prominent acknowledgments of the enslaved. \u201cLives Bound Together,\u201d which runs through September 2018, was originally going to fill one    room in the museum here, but soon expanded to include six other galleries normally dedicated to the decorative and fine arts, books and manuscripts. \u201cWe had so much material, and it\u2019s such an important story,\u201d Susan P. Schoelwer, the curator at Mount Vernon, said. \u201cWe realized we could take many of the objects already on view and reframe them. \u201d The exhibition makes it clear just who poured from the elegant teapots and did the backbreaking work on the   estate. But integrating the harsh reality of slavery into the heroic story of Washington  \u2014   \u201ca leader of character,\u201d as the title of the permanent exhibition across from the slavery show calls him  \u2014   remains unfinished work, some scholars say. \u201cHe\u2019s a much more mythic figure than Jefferson,\u201d said Annette   the author of \u201cThe Hemingses of Monticello\u201d and a Harvard professor. \u201cMany people want to see him as perfect in some way. \u201d But his determined pursuit of Judge, she said, as much as his will freeing his slaves, reflects the basic   of slave owners. \u201cIt\u2019s saying, \u2018Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,\u2019\u201d she said. Ms. Dunbar, the author of \u201cNever Caught,\u201d first came across Ona Judge in the late 1990s, when she was a graduate student at Columbia researching free black women in Philadelphia. One day in the archives, she noticed a 1796 newspaper ad offering $10 for the return of \u201ca light Mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy hair\u201d who had \u201cabsconded\u201d from the president\u2019s house. \u201cI said to myself: \u2018Here I am, a scholar in this field. Why don\u2019t I know about her? \u2019\u201d Ms. Dunbar recalled. Since then, Judge\u2019s story has inspired several children\u2019s books, and even an episode of \u201cDrunk History. \u201d But \u201cNever Caught\u201d is the first   nonfiction account, drawing on some newly unearthed sources to track her from Mount Vernon to New York City, Philadelphia and then New Hampshire, at a time when gradual abolition left the line between slavery and freedom ambiguous. \u201cThere\u2019s a myth of the North as free, but her story shows how complicated that was,\u201d Ms. Dunbar said. It is in the meticulous ledgers of Mount Vernon that we first see Ona Maria Judge, who was born around 1773 to an enslaved mother and a father who was a white indentured servant. At age 9 she was brought to live in the mansion house, eventually becoming Martha Washington\u2019s personal maid. When Washington became president, Judge followed the first couple to New York and then Philadelphia, home to a growing free black community. Free blacks, Ms. Dunbar writes, aided Judge\u2019s escape in the midst of a presidential dinner, after she had learned that she was to be given to Martha Washington\u2019s granddaughter, Eliza. And it was free blacks who helped her catch a sailing ship to Portsmouth, N. H. where she married, had three children and lived on the edge of poverty, laboring in households far less exalted than the Washingtons\u2019. In two interviews published in abolitionist newspapers shortly before her death in 1848, Judge testified to the desire for freedom that drove her to run away from the Washington household, where she had \u201cnever received the least moral or mental instruction,\u201d she said. Judge\u2019s story, Ms. Dunbar said, explodes any notion of \u201cprivileged\u201d house slaves, or of the benevolence of the Washingtons, whose far from passive role in perpetuating slavery  \u2014   and in doling out sometimes brutal punishment to the rebellious  \u2014   is described in detail. Ms. Dunbar describes how the Washingtons quietly maneuvered around Pennsylvania\u2019s 1780 gradual abolition law, rotating their slaves in and out of the state every six months. And she recounts their shock at the \u201cingratitude\u201d of Judge, who fled \u201cwithout any provocation,\u201d the president wrote. After hearing that Judge was in Portsmouth, Washington, offering a story that she had been \u201centiced away by a Frenchman,\u201d discreetly sent a federal customs officer to bring her back, circumventing procedures laid out in the 1793 fugitive slave law he himself had signed. When Judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on Martha\u2019s death, George Washington dismissed her demand as \u201ctotally inadmissible. \u201d However much he might favor general emancipation, he wrote to the customs officer, granting Judge any say in her fate would only \u201creward unfaithfulness\u201d and give ideas to others \u201cfar more deserving of favor. \u201d In August 1799, Washington, through another associate, tried again to capture her, but was foiled when Judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared. Four months later Washington was dead, freeing all his slaves in his will. Judge and the others held by Martha Washington remained her legal property. Ms. Dunbar calls Washington\u2019s act \u201cno small thing,\u201d but does not see the former president, who had no biological children to disinherit, as the hero of the story. \u201cWhen it was safe, he emancipated his slaves,\u201d she said. \u201cHe dealt with it after his death. And you know what? That\u2019s what all the founders did with slavery: They kicked the can down the road. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562159.0814111}
