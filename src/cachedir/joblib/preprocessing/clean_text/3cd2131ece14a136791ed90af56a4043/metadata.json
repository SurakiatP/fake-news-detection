Australia. Yep, we\u2019re up there with Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \\nThe Australian taxpayer shovelled at least $88 million into the Clinton Foundation and associated entities from 2006 to 2014, reaching a peak of $10.3 million in 2012-13, Gillard\u2019s last year in office. Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard both involved in the influence-peddling political slush fund that is the Clinton Foundation. \\nOn the Clinton Foundation website, AusAID and the Commonwealth of Australia score separate entries in the $10 million-plus group of donors, one rung up from American teacher unions. \\nIn 2009-10 Kevin Rudd handed over another $10 million to the foundation for climate research, part of $300 million he squandered on a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. \\nGillard also donated $300 million of our money to the Clinton-affiliated Global Partnership for Education. \\nLo and behold, she became chairman in 2014 and has been \\xadactively promoting Clinton as president ever since \u2014 in a campaign video last December slamming Trump, in opeds trumpeting the next woman president and in appearances with Clinton spruiking girls\u2019 education. \\nThe Abbott government topped up the left-wing organisation\u2019s coffers with another $140 million in 2014, bringing total Australian largesse to $460 million, according to a press release from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. \\nAnd yet, apart from the beautiful friendship with Gillard, what did Australia get from the Clintons for all that cash? \\nA whole lot of trouble is what. \\nThe latest treasure trove of Wikileaks emails released last week shows that Australian green groups have been secretly funded to destroy our coal industry by environmental activists connected to the Clinton campaign. Apart from the friendship between Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard, what does Australia get from the Clinton Foundation for donating all that cash? A whole lot of trouble is what. \\nThe email account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta reveals extraordinary details of the sabotage of the $16 billion Adani coalmine in Queensland, which has damaged Australia\u2019s national interest and denied cheap electricity to millions of poor Indians. \\nLast August John Hepburn, former Greenpeace activist and founder of Australian anti-coal group the Sunrise Project, sent a crowing email to his American paymasters, the Sandler Foundation, which is also a major donor to the Clinton Foundation. (Founder Herb Sandler and mate George Soros funded another Clinton-aligned progressive group, the Centre for American Progress, previously chaired by Podesta.) \\n\u201cThe Adani Carmichael mine and the whole Galilee Basin fossil fuel industrial complex is in its death throes,\u201d Hepburn wrote in the email forwarded to Podesta. \\n\u201cI am going to buy a few bottles of bubbly for a celebration with the (Environmental \\xadDefenders Office) legal team, our colleagues at GetUp, Greenpeace, 350.org, ECF, Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Mackay Conservation Group, Market Forces and the brilliant and tireless Sunrise team.\u201d \\nIn another email forwarded to Podesta, Hepburn panics about an Abbott government inquiry into environmental charities and discusses hiding Sunrise\u2019s sources of funding to safeguard its charitable tax status. \\nHepburn boasts about the latest legal blow to Adani, when the Federal Court overturned its approval and the Commonwealth Bank quit the project. \\nIn it he now wants to \u201cescalate the campaign \\xadtowards the other 3 big Australian banks\u201d. \\nAnd he mocks miners who \u201ctry to claim that there is some kind of foreign-funded and tightly orchestrated conspiracy to systematically \\xaddestroy the Australian coal industry. (I seriously don\u2019t know where they get these wacky ideas from!)\u201d \\nAs if it\u2019s not bad enough that foreign-funded activists are meddling with our largest export earner, Podesta\u2019s emails also detail their insidious influence on indigenous land owners who blocked the Adani mine using powerful native title rights. \\nThis alliance of green groups with native title owners is a frightening development detailed in a new book by historian Keith Windschuttle, The Break-up of Australia: The Real Agenda behind Aboriginal Recognition. \\nHe reveals the imminent expansion of native title claims, either \\xadapproved or quietly being processed, stretch across a whopping 60 per cent of the Australian continent, an area twice the size of Western Europe. \\nAlready 6000sq km of the Kidman cattle empire in the Kimberley has been given, via native title, to green activists to be converted from productive cattle country to a wildlife conservation area. \\n\u201cIn return, the Yulumbu people get a paltry $50,000 a year royalty,\u201d Windschuttle writes. \\n\u201cAs a flora and fauna sanctuary it is economically defunct for the foreseeable future.\u201d \\nAt worst, writes Windschuttle, the upcoming referendum for indigenous constitutional recognition, proposed by Gillard in 2012, could pave the way for a separate Aboriginal state on native title land, funded by taxation, royalties and lease payments \u2014 passive welfare in another guise. \\nAt the very least, the \\xadalliance between foreign-\\xadfunded green groups and \\xadindigenous owners gives \\xadenvironmentalists the opportunity to take whole swathes of Australia out of the productive economy and shut down industries they don\u2019t like, from coal mines in Queensland to cattle farms in Western Australia. \\nThanks for nothing, Hillary and Julia.
