He was 81. His death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Lucasfilm, the company that created and produces the enormously popular \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. The Associated Press reported that a nephew, Drew Myerscough, said he found Mr. Baker dead at his home in the town of Preston. Mr. Baker was a little person whose adult height was widely reported to be 3 feet 8 inches. He referred to his short stature as \u201cmy height difficulties\u201d in an autobiographical sketch on his official website, but it would have been impossible for a taller man to play the role that made him famous. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to do it we can\u2019t find anybody else. You\u2019re small enough to get into it and you\u2019re strong enough to be able to move it,\u2019\u201d he said of  \u2019s cylindrical metal costume in a video interview in Stockholm that he shared on his site. \u201cI was a godsend to them, really. \u201d Mr. Baker was born on Aug. 24, 1934, in Birmingham, England. He began his entertainment career in 1950 as part of a traveling troupe in Britain called Burton Lester\u2019s Midgets. He soon left that act and toured the country for many years, performing in theaters, nightclubs and holiday resorts in a variety of roles: circus clown, performer in an   show and, later, part of a musical comedy and variety act alongside the performer Jack Purvis. (Mr. Purvis, who died in 1997, was also in \u201cStar Wars,\u201d as the cloaked Chief Jawa, who shoots and played roles in the second and third \u201cStar Wars\u201d films as well.) The traveling act brought Mr. Baker financial security and a measure of fame in Britain, but it was an entertainment ecosystem that was wiped out by the invention of television. Then came  . That role began with the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, released in 1977  \u2014   and now officially known as \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV  \u2014   A New Hope\u201d  \u2014   but it was a part he almost did not take. \u201cThis film came along and I turned it down,\u201d Mr. Baker said in the Stockholm interview. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be stuck in a robot, what for, for goodness sake. \u2019\u201d He ultimately relented and, he said, agreed to take the job as a favor to George Lucas. The role had no lines  \u2014   the character\u2019s signature beeps and boops were not voiced by Mr. Baker  \u2014   and, seated inside the robot, he never showed his face. But   so changed his career that in later years he told an interviewer that if he could go back in time, he would do it again without pay. \u201cHad I known I would have done it for nothing because he was broke at the beginning, he didn\u2019t have a penny, George,\u201d Mr. Baker said. But he might have asked for a share of the film\u2019s profits, he added, referring to the celebrated British actor who played   Kenobi. \u201cI\u2019d be a millionaire like Alec Guinness was!\u201d Mr. Lucas said in a statement on Saturday that Mr. Baker was \u201can incredible trooper who always worked hard under difficult circumstances. \u201d \u201cA talented vaudevillian who could always make everybody laugh, Kenny was truly the heart and soul of   and will be missed by all his fans and everyone who knew him,\u201d he added. Mr. Baker played   in six \u201cStar Wars\u201d films: the original, its two sequels, and the prequels released in 1999, 2002 and 2005. He also appeared in a number of other   movies, including \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame,\u201d \u201cTime Bandits\u201d and \u201cAmadeus. \u201d No information about his survivors was immediately available. His niece Abigail Shield first reported his death to the British newspaper The Guardian.'"}, "time": 1742563516.7346833}
