But it wasn\u2019t always the kind of energy a presidential nominee wants at the outset of a general election. Republican divisions were on colorful display and threatened to overshadow Mike Pence, the   nominee, who is well liked on the right. Our takeaways (and some of Wednesday\u2019s best photos): He stuck to the script, reusing familiar lines and boiling down the Trump campaign\u2019s message into a neat sales pitch. There was no swearing and no attacking other Republicans. In other words, Mr. Pence, the governor of Indiana, gave his speech like a career politician  \u2014   and it worked. Mr. Pence, overshadowed by Donald J. Trump throughout the   rollout, used his first prominent solo performance to describe the 2016 election as a choice between a candidate of change (Mr. Trump) and \u201ca stale agenda and the most predictable of names\u201d in Hillary Clinton. He vouched for Mr. Trump\u2019s moral character, calling him \u201cthe right man for these times. \u201d After two days of meandering speeches from obscure politicians and minor celebrities, Mr. Pence brought roars of enthusiasm from the crowd and set a high bar for Mr. Trump to clear, with his more freewheeling approach, on Thursday. The   in the Republican primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, did not endorse Mr. Trump for president. He congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination but urged Americans only to vote their conscience in the fall. At one point, Mr. Cruz explicitly looked past the 2016 election. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting not for one particular candidate or one campaign,\u201d he said, but rather to tell the next generation, \u201cWe did our best for our future and our country. \u201d His speech earned rounds of angry booing in the room from the   crowd and only scattered chants of support from friendly delegations. But with a soaring address that touched on traditional   themes and praised the Republican Party\u2019s historical role in ending slavery, Mr. Cruz staked out a position for himself as a premier torchbearer for conservative ideology  \u2014   even in defiance of an unorthodox nominee. As Mr. Cruz gave a cold shoulder to Mr. Trump, other   speakers tried a range of rhetorical strategies to persuade skeptics to back him. Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, noted Mr. Trump\u2019s shortcomings  \u2014   \u201cHe can be a little rough\u201d  \u2014   before defending him as a friend. Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, said that failing to support Mr. Trump was equivalent to endorsing Mrs. Clinton. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, even repurposed Mr. Cruz\u2019s words into a plea for unity. \u201cTed Cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this election, there is only one candidate who will uphold the Constitution. \u201d In a united party, these exhortations would be unnecessary. And every minute of airtime devoted to cajoling reluctant conservatives was a minute not aimed at winning over swing voters for the general election. Trump advisers promised that the gathering in Cleveland would not be standard fare, but rather a \u201cTrump convention. \u201d More precisely, it has been a Trump family convention. Traditional leaders like Mr. Walker and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, have been confined to earlier time slots. Leading off the crucial 10 p. m. hour have been members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family: Donald Jr. regaled the audience on Tuesday with tales of his father\u2019s business feats. On Wednesday, another son, Eric Trump, spoke of the   rehabilitation of Wollman Rink in Manhattan. The   schedule reflects Mr. Trump\u2019s narrow comfort zone and his conviction that the best surrogates are blood relatives. But it also has the effect of playing down the support he has earned from establishment Republicans just when his circle of allies needs to grow.'"}, "time": 1742563808.0434413}
