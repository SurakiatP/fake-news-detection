The whiplash legal drama over President Trump\u2019s immigration actions highlighted swirling confusion as his White House team tried to find its footing in a chaotic first few weeks on the job. Mr. Trump said that he might sign \u201ca   order\u201d as soon as Monday to replace the travel ban a   appeals panel unanimously refused to reinstate. For now, refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries can continue to enter the U. S. _____ 2. Undocumented immigrants are bracing for a surge in deportations as the federal government prepares to follow through on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to crack down on illegal immigration. A case in Phoenix illustrated their fears: Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos, 35, a married mother of two who sneaked across the border 21 years ago, was deported to Nogales, Mexico, after a routine   with the federal immigration agency. Her abrupt removal \u201cillustrates the new reality,\u201d the Mexican government said, warning its citizens in the U. S. to \u201ctake precautions and to keep in touch with their nearest consulate. \u201d _____ 3. Senate battles and unexpected revelations about nominees  \u2014   undocumented household workers, questionable stock trades, undisclosed financial holdings  \u2014   slowed the formation of the Trump cabinet to a crawl. Betsy DeVos became education secretary only after a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence  \u2014   and an acrimonious,   vigil on the Senate floor by the chamber\u2019s Democrats. Tom Price was confirmed as secretary of health and human services after another   marathon. This week, the Senate holds confirmation votes on Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, David Shulkin to head veterans affairs and Linda McMahon for administrator of the Small Business Administration. It will also hold a hearing on Andrew Puzder, whose nomination to be labor secretary has been opposed by labor groups concerned about his heavy opposition to workplace regulation. _____ 4. #LetLizSpeak became a rallying cry after Republican senators chided and formally silenced Senator Elizabeth Warren for impugning a peer, Senator Jeff Sessions, as she opposed his nomination for attorney general by reading a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King. The move unleashed a powerful backlash, not least among women who know what it\u2019s like to be told to hold their tongues. As our reporter wrote: \u201cRepublicans seized her microphone. And gave her a megaphone. \u201d Outside Washington, Republicans in state capitals are swiftly using their newfound power  \u2014      control in 25 states  \u2014   to advance a wave of legislation aiming to curtail union powers and abortion rights, loosen gun regulations, expand   programs and slash taxes and spending. _____ 5. Mr. Trump made further forays into foreign relations, tempering some of his harsher statements. To secure a phone call with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, he made conciliatory comments and affirmed his commitment to America\u2019s \u201cOne China\u201d policy. He also pulled toward the center on Israel, saying that the nation\u2019s move to expand its West Bank settlements is not \u201ca good thing for peace. \u201d North Korea tested a ballistic missile, prompting statements of solidarity from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Mr. Trump, who were at the president\u2019s    resort in Florida for a    outing. Above, the Trumps with Mr. Abe and his wife, Akie Abe, and Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots. The president meets this week with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on Monday, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday. _____ 6. Nordstrom became the latest business to wander into the president\u2019s sights when it decided to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s retail brand from its stores, citing poor performance. The fallout: a critical presidential tweet, a \u201cboycott Nordstrom\u201d movement from Trump supporters, a \u201csupport Nordstrom\u201d push from Trump opponents, and a dizzying example of the partisan tightrope companies now walk. _____ 7. The 59th Grammy Awards are tonight (CBS, 8 p. m. Eastern, red carpet a   earlier) and the race to watch is Adele versus Beyonc\u00e9, facing off in each of the top three categories: album, record and song of the year. James Corden, a   Grammy host, is planning to make the most of his 15 minutes (literally that\u2019s all he gets) and our writers have tips on five    artists to watch. Not interested in the music showdown? You might still be fascinated by this tale of how the 350 Grammy trophies are made by a craftsman who has been at it for nearly 30 years. _____ 8. The arc of women\u2019s working lives is changing. Compared with past generations, women are now more likely to work at every stage of their lives, including into their 60s and even 70s. Some older workers keep their jobs out of financial necessity, but economic research indicates that a growing number of women stay employed longer because they find their careers fulfilling. \u201cI feel 40,\u201d said Lee Ann Monfredini, above, 68 and a broker in San Francisco. \u201cI\u2019m really not that good at the retirement thing. And I love the joy of getting that big commission check. \u201d _____ 9. On TV, \u201cGirls\u201d returns tonight for its final season (HBO, 10 p. m. Eastern) and John Oliver will also be back in action after a long break (HBO, 11 p. m. Eastern). If you\u2019re on the hunt for weekend viewing suggestions, our Watching team has some ideas.

Romantics can check out our latest Modern Love podcast or revisit one of the column\u2019s perennially   entries: \u201cThe 36 Questions That Lead to Love. \u201d Those on the verge of a permanent pairing might want to also consult \u201c13 Questions to Ask Before Getting Married. \u201d Our \u201cCommitted\u201d series explores the   history of wedding announcements in The New York Times, with updates on noteworthy couples like the Gibbses, one of the first   pairs featured. Sixty years later, they are still happily together. _____ 11. And finally, more optimistic news on aging well, from a new scientific study of a    cyclist. You can take advantage of his workout approach  \u2014   brief bursts of strenuous activity mixed with   exercise  \u2014   in as little as one minute.
