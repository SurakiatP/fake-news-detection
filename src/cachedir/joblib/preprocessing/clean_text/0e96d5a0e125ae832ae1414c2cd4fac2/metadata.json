They think that because they share an accent with Rex Harrison from My Fair Lady this makes them geniuses.\" \\nHe continued: \\nSo John Oliver does a political show on American politics; he doesn\u2019t know much about American politics; he doesn\u2019t know much about politics generally; but he\u2019s been feted by the media because he\u2019s a comedian who\u2019s wildly to the left. So just like President Obama is going to be interviewed by Samantha Bee, who is legitimately the least funny person in human history, (she and Trevor Noah actually have a cage match next week to determine who\u2019s the least funny person in human history. Both of them I believe, beat Stalin for that title a while back, so now were going to unify the championships), so Obama\u2019s going to be on with Samantha Bee, where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortion\u2019s wonderful. \\nJohn Oliver was ripping on Donald Trump the other day at some awards ceremony, and because he\u2019s British, that means we\u2019re supposed to pay attention to him, even though we fought a revolution so we wouldn\u2019t have to pay attention to the Brits. Here\u2019s John Oliver talking about abortion: \\nThe screen then showed Oliver pontificating: \\nIn terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important; we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of women\u2019s bodies, and a very poor sense of grammar as well. So I guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. If you ask Donald Trump to draw a Fallopian tube, I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a child\u2019s drawing of a cobra. \\nShapiro fired back: \\nOkay. I would hesitate to ask John Oliver to draw a Fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here, because he obviously doesn\u2019t know. Now look, I criticized Trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasn\u2019t graphic enough. But let me, for those who missed it, explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion, which is what he was talking about, okay? What happens in a late-term abortion, what happens in a late-term abortion, is something completely awful; this is according to americanpregnancy.org., okay? Not a right-wing pro-life website: americanpregnancy.org: \"The fetus is rotated; forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs, shoulders and arms through the birth canal. A small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. The catheter removes the cerebral material,\u201d that would be the brains, \u201cuntil the skull collapses. The fetus is then completely removed.\u201d \\nShapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure: \\nOkay, that\u2019s one procedure that\u2019s used; that\u2019s \u201cdilation and extraction.\u201d In late-term abortions it usually one of these two; \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d or \u201cdilation and extraction.\u201d \u201cDilation and evacuation\u201d: The baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it; sometimes they don\u2019t use such injections; then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the child\u2019s body in the womb, and remove it piece by piece. \\nThen he proceeded to carve up Oliver: \\nSo I guess that Donald Trump could have been more graphic; I don\u2019t know that John Oliver would have enjoyed that, but he could have been more graphic, I suppose. But this is what they do, laugh it up, \u201cOh, he can\u2019t draw a Fallopian tube.\" \\nOkay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let\u2019s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. It\u2019s not waving a magic wand, and it\u2019s not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. I would like to see that. \"Okay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let\u2019s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like.\" Ben Shapiro \\nShapiro concluded: \\nBut of course he\u2019ll never do that, other than, \"It might look like a cobra; it might look like a cobra; maybe it\u2019ll look like a princess, waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina.\u201d The fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child-killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable. \\nVideo below: '"}, "time": 1742628500.1646795}
