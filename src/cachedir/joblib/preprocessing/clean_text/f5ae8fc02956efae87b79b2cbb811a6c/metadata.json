The electronic musician who calls himself Burial deals in blurry, melancholy, ominous implications. His first release since 2013 is a pair of tracks that are never far from dissolving into entropy. \u201cYoung Death\u201d can be glimpsed from the farthest fringe of dance music most of it has fairly steady but nearly subliminal beats, though they are submerged deep in the mix. Much closer to the foreground are crackly sounds  \u2014   a storm? a burning city?  \u2014   and voices singing words that would be soothing if they didn\u2019t sound so utterly lost: \u201cDon\u2019t fear,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d \u201cI will always be there for you. \u201d The beat is absorbed by the static, to be replaced by one that\u2019s slower and even less supportive. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, promise I\u2019ll be,\u201d a voice offers before the haze swallows it, too. \u201cNightmarket\u201d is an even more shadowy, attenuated travelogue. Its passages of blippy arpeggios are separated by lengthy stretches with echoes of wind chimes, distant keening voices, screams, whispers and stray spoken words  \u2014   \u201cCome with me,\u201d \u201cthe frontier,\u201d \u201cover here!\u201d  \u2014   that only lead deeper into the void. JON PARELES The title of Laura Marling\u2019s ravishing new song isn\u2019t meant as a descriptor, but rather a note of anguish  \u2014   like the word \u201cwater\u201d as rasped by someone crawling across a desert. \u201cOh my hopeless wanderer,\u201d she sings at the start of the track, tracing an upward arpeggio in a minor key. \u201cYou can\u2019t come in, you don\u2019t live here anymore. \u201d Still, Ms. Marling toys with aspects of seduction in the song\u2019s arrangement, which leans heavy on a sinuous electric bass, and in the video, which she directed herself. Inspired by a series of dreams she had while making her new album  \u2014   \u201cSemper Femina,\u201d due out in March  \u2014   it\u2019s a vision of human bodies as sculptural forms, and also an argument for physical intimacy as just another mode of performance. NATE CHINEN If you are the sort of person who expends much energy stressing about the fact that rapper du jour Lil Yachty had not, until recently, listened to the music of the Notorious B. I. G. then little in this   freestyle  \u2014   on the Beats 1 radio show of his longtime antagonist Ebro Darden  \u2014   will change your mind. Rather than concede to the beat  \u2014   Craig Mack\u2019s \u201cFlava In Ya Ear,\u201d the remix of which featured B. I. G.  \u2014   and perform a flow that recalled the original, in an act of homage, Yachty goes rogue, rapping in elongated sentences that stretch past the ordinary beat boundaries. It\u2019s not quite virtuoso, but it\u2019s intriguing  \u2014   the sound of a rapper following the beat in his head, not his earphones: I\u2019m in a Benz and I\u2019m getting a BentleyI\u2019m reading texts from last night, she said \u2018I love how you bent me\u2019I just bought a Benz and it said \u2018please take me\u2019You wanna buy it but you can\u2019t, so you\u2019re rentingYou take it back in six months, if there\u2019s no denting JON CARAMANICA \u201cArkansas,\u201d by the rising Texas country singer Troy Cartwright, is wonderfully patient. On this song, from his recent EP, \u201cDon\u2019t Fade,\u201d he muses about the stability of a relationship (\u201cIs this love or is this convenience? \u201d) and, after a couple of minutes, comes to no conclusions. And yet his voice is remarkably free of anxiety  \u2014   he\u2019ll wait as long as it takes, play it as it lays. That\u2019s clearest when he\u2019s not singing at all: the   at the song\u2019s end that\u2019s just melancholy, stretched out ambient notes with cricket noises screaming for attention in the background. J. C. You won\u2019t hear Paul Simon\u2019s voice until after the   mark on \u201cStranger,\u201d a hypnotic new track featuring elements of his recent songs \u201cThe Werewolf\u201d and \u201cThe Clock. \u201d Made by Nico Segal and Nate Fox of the Social Experiment  \u2014   a Chicago group best known for its affiliation with Chance the Rapper  \u2014   it\u2019s a remix and   but also an imaginative new creation. Those first two minutes involve some sharp, brooding horn playing by Mr. Segal, who until recently went by the name Donnie Trumpet. The production on the track is dreamy but also clearly drawn, so that Mr. Simon\u2019s voice, when it does surface, practically crackles in the mix. N. C. \u201cWhen and where did we go cold?\u201d Oliver Sim of the xx wonders in \u201cOn Hold,\u201d the single previewing the xx\u2019s album \u201cI See You,\u201d due Jan. 13. It\u2019s a familiar sentiment for the xx, an English band known for   introspection and dialogues of estrangement sung by Mr. Sim and Romy Madley Croft. But now the band is visible by daylight, and they even smile now and then. The video clip for \u201cOn Hold\u201d is set under the cloudless blue skies of Marfa, Tex. the town known for Donald Judd\u2019s Chinati Foundation, a Minimalist monument. When Mr. Sim and Ms. Madley Croft aren\u2019t trading recriminations and regrets (via landlines) the video shows glimpses of   life, including a romance between a football player and a cheerleader. Meanwhile, the song presents the xx as no longer rigorously minimalistic. A dance beat periodically surges in the mix, echoing what Jamie xx has been doing as a solo act and club D. J. meanwhile, a sample from Hall  Oates\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Go for That\u201d suggests that the xx isn\u2019t entirely isolated from pop after all. J. P. The new album by the cornetist and composer Taylor Ho Bynum is \u201cEnter the PlusTet,\u201d a rich textural odyssey featuring a   orchestra. It\u2019s a grand statement, but hardly the only thing Mr. Bynum has been working on. A couple of months ago, at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, he introduced a smaller band he calls Rank Sentimentalist, whose ranks include the electric bassist Stomu Takeishi and the cellist Marika Hughes. This video captures the opening song in the set: a   hallucinatory cover of \u201cBlack Lake,\u201d by Bj\u00f6rk. Stick with the clip for the full     minutes, and you\u2019ll begin to understand how improvisers like Mr. Bynum can turn a brief scrap of melody into something as churning and vast as an oceanic swell. N. C. Jamire Williams is a drummer with a   capacity for groove, which has served him well as a sideman. He also has his own band, Erimaj  \u2014   but on \u201c      EFFECTUAL,\u201d he pares down almost entirely to solo drum kit, creating a series of poetic experiments in rhythm and tonal color. The album, produced by Carlos Ni\u00f1o, recalls jazz precursors like Max Roach as well as   loops and West African folk drumming. And while there isn\u2019t much in the way of melody, the closing track, \u201cCollaborate With God,\u201d features some atmospheric keyboard work by Chassol, the French soundtrack composer who can also be heard on Frank Ocean\u2019s recent visual album, \u201cEndless. \u201d N. C. A technological collapse is just the entry point to a personal one in \u201cA Lost Machine,\u201d from a Grandaddy album due in March. The music unites fragility and majesty, placing Jason Lytle\u2019s high, quavery voice atop a piano hymn that swells into a vastly reverberant processional, like Neil Young leading Pink Floyd. The lyrics start out by sketching a   landscape, where wandering people desperately seek shelter in a \u201ccanyon land\u201d littered with old, obsolete gadgets. But that\u2019s their problem: Halfway through, Mr. Lytle turns his voice into a chorale and laments: \u201cEverything about us is a lost   about we is a forgotten dream. \u201d A broken world can\u2019t compare to a broken heart.
