[\u201cI honestly think there\u2019s something to it,\u201d Duncan said when asked about the notion of a deep state. \u201cYou go back to October. The New York Times reported that there were wiretaps. There were transcripts of things that were said in private conversation. \u201d  Added Duncan, \u201cIn broader context, we need to think of the entrenched bureaucrats and whether they can be fired once they\u2019re ratted out for leaking information, how we fire folks that have worked for the government for a long time  \u2014   career or not. \u201d Shifting to immigration, Duncan said, \u201cWe are a very benevolent country. We have always taken refugees. \u201d Paraphrasing the Statue of Liberty inscription, he said, \u201cGive us your tired, your poor, your hungry. \u201d \u201cBut folks had to go to Ellis Island,\u201d added Duncan, \u201cand wait to be screened before they were able to come into the country. And then once they came, they were required to assimilate. \u201d \u201cWe have thrown assimilation out the window,\u201d he stated.
