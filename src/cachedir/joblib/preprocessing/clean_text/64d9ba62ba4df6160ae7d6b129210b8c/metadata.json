It is not being openly scrutinized outside of this audience of a few special interests .\u201d \\nBy failing to live up to their duties in a functioning democracy, the mainstream media have played their part in granting the government a previously unthinkable amount of power. The Clinton presidential campaign is a case in point. Unencumbered by the law and unscrutinized by the media, Clinton as president will wield a dictator\u2019s authority. \\nSnowden believes journalists simply must resume criticizing the powers that be, and provoking public debate \u2013 and the topic of spying and hacking should be top of the agenda. \\n\u201c We have technologies that can protect communications in an unbreakable format when they\u2019re in transit. Governments have reacted to this as if we\u2019ve thrown them in a pool of acid, saying you know, \u201cyou\u2019re shutting us out, you\u2019re going dark.\u201d This is false. \\nAny government official who claims we\u2019re going dark is lying. We know this because we have classified documents from inside governments and we have reportage from journalists who have been in private sessions with these officials. Things are pretty bad for our side. For the government\u2019s side, it\u2019s never been easier. How do we reconcile this with this idea that these are theoretically, as far as our understanding of mathematics goes, unbreakable communications? \\nIt\u2019s because what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re thwarting mass surveillance when we use encryption. We\u2019re not stopping targeted surveillance. Because even, again, if you have the most well-encrypted device in the world, if the government spends a million dollars to pay a hacker to exploit your phone personally, they will very likely succeed. \\nIn our current state of the art, offense is easier than defense. This is an unfortunate artifact of the fact that governments around the world have prioritized offensive capabilities for the benefit of spying on people so much more strongly than they have defensive capabilities, preventing our countries from being hacked. And this is what\u2019s leading to the kind of dynamics we see today. \\nWhether it\u2019s the Office of Personnel Management; whether it\u2019s this recent Democratic National Committee hack; whether it\u2019s all of these other things about infrastructural attacks; fear of the power grid being attacked\u2014these were preventable problems. \\nBut unfortunately we don\u2019t have this pressure\u2014that should be simply blistering\u2014coming from newspapers, going, \u201cWe are the most advanced societies in the world, we are the most connected societies in the world, and in some sort of computer-based conflict. We have more to lose.\u201d \\nWe can hack Russia ten times; it will cause less damage to them than one hack to us will cause. We can hack North Korea 1,000 times, and they will suffer less damage than if they hacked us a single time. This is not a game that we want to get into, so why are we doing so? It\u2019s because policy is short-sighted.\u201d \\nThe whole interview is available here:'"}, "time": 1742564099.9103084}
