But on a recent Friday, Lady Elizabeth  \u2014   the orchestrator of some of Britain\u2019s most aristocratic parties  \u2014   was in her    sitting room. She was wearing a gray Tomasz Starzewski jacket bought on sale more than 40 years ago, drinking tea from a   tankard (an eBay find) and discussing her recovery from her weekly lottery   addiction. \u201cI still do a lucky dip if it\u2019s a huge amount of money,\u201d said Lady Elizabeth, who has also organized events for Tom Cruise and other celebrities seeking discretion. On her feet were what looked like Roger Vivier court shoes, but when a reporter suggested she might like to remove whatever was stuck to the bottom of them before having her photograph taken, Lady Elizabeth, 75, handed the footwear to her liveried butler. \u201cCertainly, my lady,\u201d he said, before getting rid of the price tags that revealed that the shoes cost \u00a325 (about $35). \u201cMarks  Spencer\u2019s best,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said, looking delighted at this evidence of her frugality. And really, why shouldn\u2019t she be? Among her \u201cgrander family,\u201d as she calls them, frugality is a trait to be celebrated. The queen has been known to take public trains. Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge (whom Lady Elizabeth refers to as \u201cCatherine\u201d) is applauded for wearing dresses more than once. Let somebody else be the embarrassingly profligate relative that makes the monarchy look bad. Lady Elizabeth  \u2014   daughter of Princess Anne of Denmark, goddaughter of King George VI  \u2014   is just another   entrepreneur, albeit possibly the only one with the word \u201clady\u201d in her email address. \u201cI do not know how to be a lady who lunches,\u201d she said. \u201cI love my work, and my work pays for my home. \u201d She asked the butler to bring her her nicotine sweets. She gave up smoking in the \u201960s, picked it up after 17 years, then quit with difficulty again 11 years ago. If she were to start again, the sitting room would rebuke her. Every surface is crammed with decorative eggs  \u2014   536 of them, by her grandchildren\u2019s last count  \u2014   that she began collecting after her stepfather presented her with an alabaster one as a worry bead for her right hand when she first put down the cigarettes. Hers is a   business. One of her projects is the queen\u2019s 90th birthday this month. The milestone is being marked with street parties, pageants and ceremonies, but Lady Elizabeth handled the private family celebration, which, like all of her events, she was \u201cnot prepared to discuss. \u201d Still, she is as unguarded as one can possibly be when bound by confidentiality agreements, referring to one of Ivana Trump\u2019s   husbands as \u201clooking like a frog. \u201d (Mrs. Trump is a former client. Things did not end well.) Of the overweight king of Tonga, whom she was looking after, along with all the other foreign heads of state, at the 2011 royal wedding, she said, \u201cHe thought he\u2019d break the furniture in Buckingham Palace. \u201d The chairs there are \u201cvery low,\u201d she said, \u201cvery wonderful Louis Quatorze. It looks as if you sat on it, it would break. But it doesn\u2019t. \u201d During a discussion about the lost art of conversation because of cellphones, she took her incessantly ringing land line off the hook, letting the receiver dangle at her stockinged feet, and leaned in, saying: \u201cI think I can tell this. It\u2019s a bit about the royal family. \u201d She described how the queen had had her grandchildren over for dinner. \u201cAnd she said to me that she found it really difficult,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t really know how to talk each other. And she said, \u2018I suppose it\u2019s because they\u2019re always getting up and down and helping somebody and putting something in a dishwasher or whatever they\u2019re doing, because they don\u2019t have enough staff. \u2019\u201d On the subject of Her Majesty: For the record, the queen is a \u201cmost meticulous hostess,\u201d though she does not insist only on Malvern water or yellow freesias, as has been reported. \u201cPeople love creating myths,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said. \u201cIt makes them feel very  . \u201d In fact, it was a gardener at Windsor Castle who decreed the yellow flowers. For the wedding of William and Kate, for which Lady Elizabeth was an adviser (and planned the wedding eve family dinner) the couple had very strong ideas that the queen \u201cwas marvelous and listened to,\u201d she said. Traditional royal weddings have no reception afterward  \u2014   guests just depart after the service  \u2014   but William and Kate wanted one after seeing that was what their friends had had. \u201cAnd so the palace had to learn quite a lot about different canap\u00e9s, because they weren\u2019t used to doing them,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said. Her code name around the office for the queen is (or was until it\u2019s been published) Shirley Temple, though Lady Elizabeth said she can\u2019t remember why. Referring to her staff of five, she said: \u201cWe literally had the funniest names possible for everybody. And the people who were the most aware of their celeb importance that I\u2019ve ever had got names that were truly extraordinary. \u201d While looking at wedding sites with the actress Isla Fisher, who was marrying Sacha Baron Cohen, Lady Elizabeth was amused that Ms. Fisher (code name: Sally Dangletrot) kept three different wigs in the car to disguise herself. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known her if she was passing down the street,\u201d she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say that because it\u2019s quite rude. \u201d Lady Elizabeth started her business at age 18, in 1960. Her inspiration was the stress of planning her own 1959 debutante party, which prevented her from enjoying the evening. Chasing down R. S. V. P. s was a particular headache, and she claims credit for inventing \u201cthis ghastly thing called the reply card\u201d to solve the problem. The first time she created one, she forgot to leave a space for people to write their names, and so she ended up with a bunch of yeses and nos but no clue who they were from. Her first event for the queen was a disco at Windsor Castle for Prince Charles, then 15, and Princess Anne, then 13. \u201cMy business started before the discoth\u00e8que was invented,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when this man told me he was going to charge me \u00a325 to put on records for the evening, I thought, \u2018Is this man absolutely crazy?\u2019 Anybody can put on a gramophone record. \u201d She soon learned it was \u201can art form. \u201d A party for the Rolling Stones ended with the police showing up as guests were drunkenly throwing unopened bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon into the Thames, but generally Lady Elizabeth\u2019s events are known for their calm elegance and thoughtful touches. At a   dinner for 40 people last month hosted by royalty at the cavernous, drafty Victoria  Albert Museum, Lady Elizabeth marched over to \u201cmy little Indian caftan man on the Portobello Road\u201d and bought a load of white pashminas to drape on each chair. She hid   bottles underneath cushions. (She also suggested to guests that they wear \u201cheat tech from Uniqlo. \u201d) \u201cIt\u2019s that ghastly boring phrase \u2018the devil\u2019s in the details. \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe devil is in the detail, and the detail doesn\u2019t need to cost very much. \u201d She can do strict protocol  \u2014   working out what year various marquesses or earls were created to determine seniority (and thus seating arrangements)  \u2014   but she is not afraid to break it, along with convention. Glynn Woodin, who has worked with her for 30 years as the managing director of Mustard Catering, a society favorite, recalled that recently she decided the damask tablecloth (Mr. Woodin described its color as \u201ceau de vie with a bit of olive\u201d) would look better flipped upside down, using the rougher textured side. \u201cWe were doing a party absolutely littered with royals,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and I would be horrified to use a cloth on the wrong side, but it was exactly right. \u201d She has never advertised. Instead, she attributes her success in part to being \u201cterribly, terribly shy\u201d  \u2014   she still bemoans a party she never quite made it to years ago where, dressed in a red velvet trouser suit and with her hair freshly done, she stood by the elevator watching people go in, unable to summon the nerve to do the same. And so she arranges party spaces with the timid in mind. \u201cThe downfall of any party in the countryside is to walk into a hall and be confronted by a dance floor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd some young man has driven you down, so he\u2019s got a girl on both arms, and what do you do with yourself?\u201d Her solution: a   bar, which she calls a \u201cpicking up and dumping ground. \u201d With multiple events a week, she said she has little time for hobbies, though she was an avid \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d watcher (dismayed as she was by the dining room tablecloth  \u2014   \u201ca   table was a butler\u2019s pride and joy\u201d). She has a fondness for foraging, especially for mushrooms. \u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful book called \u2018Food for Free,\u2019 and it\u2019s quite amazing what you can eat from the hedgerows,\u201d she said. She paused to contemplate what she would do if she retired, but then quickly got back to work.'"}, "time": 1742561898.744536}
