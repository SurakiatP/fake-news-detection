Sent to him in digital form by an agent of an unknown author, Paula  Hawkins, it was a     novel with three untrustworthy female narrators  \u2014   one of them an unhappy, alcoholic divorc\u00e9e named Rachel Watson who believes she has witnessed something key to a woman\u2019s disappearance. \u201cIt was eerie, creepy and enticing,\u201d Mr. LeBoff said about the twisty, Hitchcockian tone of Ms. Hawkins\u2019s book. \u201cIt just added up to a juicy piece of material. \u201d Mr. Platt and DreamWorks Pictures apparently agreed, and without the headache of a bidding war, they soon optioned the rights. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until the following year, around the time the screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson (\u201cSecretary\u201d) was turning in her first draft of an adaptation, and Ms. Hawkins\u2019s American publisher, Riverhead Books, was releasing her novel here, that those associated with the screen version of \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d realized this was more than just an ordinary    project. Their source material seemed to be everywhere. \u201cI kept seeing girls on the subway reading the book,\u201d said Ms. Wilson, who made a pastime of surreptitiously photographing people with noses buried in \u201cThe Girl on the Train. \u201d \u201cI sort of started a catalog of girls reading the book, on the subway, in cafes I saw a man reading it in a diner. It sort of confirmed the zeitgeist of something that Paula had captured. \u201d Within two weeks of hitting shelves and   \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d shot to the top of the New York Times   list. In reviews, it was often compared with \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Gillian Flynn\u2019s suspense phenomenon of 2012, which resulted in a   film adaptation grossing roughly $369 million worldwide and earning Rosamund Pike an Oscar nod. While Mr. Platt and DreamWorks didn\u2019t have the same luxury of time as the \u201cGone Girl\u201d production  \u2014   an almost      journey from print to screen  \u2014   they had Ms. Wilson\u2019s adaptation as interest in Ms. Hawkins\u2019s book exploded. Tate Taylor, who directed another     adaptation, \u201cThe Help,\u201d was brought in. By then, everyone was in   mode, Mr. Taylor said. \u201cThey were like: \u2018We\u2019ve got to get this thing made. We\u2019ve got lightning in a bottle here. We\u2019ve got to get it out for fall of 2016.\u2019 So we just amped it up. \u201d On a trip to London to meet with Emily Blunt, who would be cast as the     Rachel, Mr. Taylor also met Ms. Hawkins for what he called \u201ca   business talk. She said, \u2018What are your intentions?\u2019 and I said, \u2018This needs to be really dark and sexy, and it needs to be truthful.\u2019 And she said: \u2018I love it! Let\u2019s get a gin and tonic.\u2019 That was the entire thing. \u201d Another consequence of the book\u2019s meteoric rise was that they now had a   audience to worry about. \u201cIn the movie world, everyone is looking to break through all the noise with a brand, and a   book is such a thing,\u201d Mr. Platt said. \u201cBut all of the sudden, you have expectations. What starts to creep into the conversation is how much you veer from the source material and how much you don\u2019t. You ask yourself, \u2018How can we make something that really works as a film, but yet still satisfy a very large fan base? \u2019\u201d No one needs to remind him that when the film opens on Oct. 7, roughly 21 months after its original January 2015 book publication date, it will have to satisfy a fan base that has only continued growing. Having now spent more than 80 weeks and counting on the   list, \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d has hit No. 1 in hardcover and   trade paperback and   paperback. Riverhead has printed close to 1. 4 million copies of a special movie   edition. Given the ubiquity of \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d billboards, bus shelter posters and book displays in supermarkets, bookstores and airports nationwide, even publishing insiders have trouble pinpointing the exact cause of the exponential increase in sales. That said, every time Universal runs the film\u2019s moody trailer  \u2014   as it did on Aug. 9, right before Michael Phelps won his 20th Olympic gold medal  \u2014   Riverhead sees a buying surge. Ms. Hawkins, speaking by phone from London, said she had watched the finished version of the film and spoke about what it was like to see characters she created walking, talking and moving around. \u201cIt\u2019s a shocking film in parts, really frightening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd thing, because I actually know what\u2019s happening, but it felt really fresh to me. \u201d Her positive response puts her in the position of addressing some readers\u2019 irritation about changes made for the screen. To appeal to the larger American audience, the action, which originally had Rachel peering woozily into other people\u2019s backyards from a commuter train running through suburban London, now puts her on the   rail line riding from Westchester County to Manhattan. \u201cWhat I say to everyone is, \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as a 100 percent faithful adaptation of a book to screen,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hawkins said, adding that early on, when it came to selling the film rights, agents asked her, \u201c\u2018Would you have a massive problem if the location was moved?\u2019 I said, No, because what\u2019s important really is the train, not what exists on the outside. \u201d Audiences should also not expect to catch a glimpse of the   Ms. Hawkins, even though, at one point, she had a cameo in the film. \u201cI was on the set, and Tate persuaded me to be on the train as one of the other passengers,\u201d Ms. Hawkins said with a laugh. \u201cTo be very honest with you, I was cut. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562366.395415}
