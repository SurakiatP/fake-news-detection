Trump\u2019s more inflammatory remarks and disavowing Mr. Trump himself. We mapped out Mr. Ryan\u2019s rhetorical footwork: A statement from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign on barring Muslim immigrants: \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on. \u201d He added, \u201cUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. \u201d Mr. Ryan: \u201cThis is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for and, more importantly, it\u2019s not what this country stands for. \u201d _____ Mr. Ryan, on endorsing Mr. Trump: \u201cI\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point. I\u2019m not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. \u201d _____ Mr. Ryan, on a   meeting with Mr. Trump: \u201cIt was important that we discussed our differences that we have. But it was also important that we discuss the core principles that tie us together. \u201d _____ Mr. Ryan on when he might give his endorsement:  \u201cI don\u2019t have a timeline in my mind, and I have not made a decision. Nothing has changed from that perspective, and we\u2019re still having productive conversations. \u201d _____ Mr. Ryan endorses Mr. Trump: \u201cThrough these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be voting for him this fall. \u201d _____ Mr. Trump, on a judge of \u201cMexican heritage\u201d presiding over Trump University cases:  \u201cI\u2019m building a wall. It\u2019s an inherent conflict of interest. \u201d Mr. Ryan:  \u201cI disavow these comments  \u2014   I regret those comments that he made. Claiming a person can\u2019t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. \u201d But not retracting his endorsement: \u201cI believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than with her. \u201d _____ Mr. Ryan, addressing the Republican National Convention: \u201cOnly with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance at a better way. \u201d _____ Mr. Trump, on Khizr Khan\u2019s remarks that he has not sacrificed:  \u201cI think I\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. \u201d Mr. Trump, on Ghazala Khan: \u201cIf you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably  \u2014   maybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me. \u201d Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, after Mr. Khan called on Mr. Ryan to repudiate Mr. Trump:  \u201cThe speaker has made clear many times that he rejects this idea, and himself has talked about how Muslim Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. \u201d _____ Mr. Ryan, in a statement, on honoring military sacrifice:  \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it. As I have said on numerous occasions, a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values. I reject it. Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice  \u2014   and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan  \u2014   should always be honored. Period. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562983.9430792}
