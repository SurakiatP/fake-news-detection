She has absolutely nothing new to offer that President Obama hasn\u2019t already tried. \\nClinton admits in her speech that things aren\u2019t all they should be in the economy after seven-plus year of Obamanomics. \u201cThe challenges we face are significant,\u201d she said. She even took a couple subtle digs at Obama, complaining about \u201clong-term neglect\u201d of poor communities and the fact that the unemployment gap between blacks and whites has been widening, whereas it was narrowing when her husband was in the White House. \\nSo what are the \u201cbig, bold\u201d ideas she said she\u2019d implement that will \u201cdrive growth\u201d? Spend more money on infrastructure, raise taxes on the rich, impose more mandates on businesses that raise the cost of labor, make college cheaper and saddle the economy with more regulations. \\nIs Clinton really not aware that this is exactly what Obama prescribed, and that his policies have produced the worst economic recovery in history? \\nHer biggest idea is to make \u201cthe biggest investment in American infrastructure in decades,\u201d saying that will create \u201cmillions of good paying jobs.\u201d \\nApparently she\u2019s forgotten that Obama\u2019s stimulus plan included, as Obama put it, \u201cthe largest new investment in our nation\u2019s infrastructure since Eisenhower built an interstate highway system in the 1950s.\u201d \\nHow did that work out for jobs? We\u2019ve had one of the slowest rates of job growth since the Great Depression, and annual economic growth never topped 3%. Oh, and according to Hillary, our roads and bridges are still crumbling. \\nClinton also says she wants to invest in \u201cadvanced manufacturing.\u201d But Obama has already nearly doubled spending on this \u2014 as part of his plan to create a million manufacturing jobs in his second term. (Manufacturing jobs have climbed only 330,000 since he made that promise.) \\nOther \u201cbold\u201d Clinton ideas are also straight out of the Obama playbook: She wants a \u201ccleaner, more resilient power grid,\u201d free child care, paid maternity leave, more power to unions. She wants to expand on the growth-killing Dodd-Frank bill. \\nPlus, of course, she wants to raise taxes on the rich, as if Obama hasn\u2019t already done that several times. \\nWhat\u2019s most amusing about Clinton\u2019s speech, however, is her claim that cutting taxes and reducing regulations as a growth strategy \u201chas been proven wrong again and again.\u201d \\nIn fact, the strongest periods of growth in the past three decades occurred during the tax-cutting, deregulating Reagan years, and after Bill Clinton agreed to cut taxes and deregulate the banking industry. In the 1960s, it was the result of Kennedy cut taxes. \\nThe inconvenient truth here is that not one of the items on Clinton\u2019s list will do anything to get the economy out of its Obama-induced malaise.
