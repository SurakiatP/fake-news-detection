Perhaps wrestling choreographers turned to political choreography for better salaries and higher stakes.\\nTrump campaign manager Kellyann Conway made the announcement.\\nvia Breitbart :\\n\u201cI think when the President-elect, who\u2019s also the head of your party, tells you before he\u2019s even inaugurated that he doesn\u2019t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone, and content to the members,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd I think Hillary Clinton still has to face the fact that the majority of Americans don\u2019t find her to be honest and trustworthy.
