On Monday evening, the singer announced online a surprise concert in Washington Square Park in Manhattan with just enough time for fans to drop their forks, reroute their taxis and arrive to see her sashay onstage in a bomber jacket with fluorescent green sleeves and a winter hat sprinkled with stars. Madonna stood in the middle of the round fountain at the center of the square, holding a red guitar and pledging her support for the Democratic presidential nominee. She welcomed everyone to \u201ca surprise, impromptu rally for Hillary Rodham Clinton. \u201d And the crowd, which had been huddled around the edges of the fountain, leapt to its feet. She then broke into her song \u201cExpress Yourself,\u201d modifying the lyrics to say, \u201cMake her express herself. \u201d The Material Girl\u2019s message was decidedly feminist and   J. Trump, the Republican nominee. \u201cWomen are marginalized, let\u2019s face it,\u201d Madonna said between songs. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we still live in an extremely chauvinist, sexist, misogynist country. And that\u2019s why Hillary Clinton needs to be president. \u201d The show was just five songs long: Madonna\u2019s own \u201cExpress Yourself,\u201d \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Me\u201d as well as \u201cImagine\u201d and a   of \u201cIf I Had a Hammer\u201d and her \u201cRebel Heart. \u201d It was mainly a singalong, in the folk music tradition of the Village. People held signs, shouted \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d and appeared to know all of the words. Those in attendance included unsuspecting tourists in the right place at the right time,   New Yorkers who had gotten texts while leaving work and volunteers for Mrs. Clinton, many of them young women, who had spent the day calling and texting voters in battleground states. There were also some super fans. \u201cI literally stalked this for 48 hours,\u201d said David Yontef, 46, who lives in Chelsea and works in advertising. For more than a day, he said, there had been false leads on the location of the secret concert. \u201cI was going to hop on a train to Philly then it seemed like it might be in Michigan  \u2014   I was refreshing the browser every 10 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThen suddenly at 7 p. m. they said 7:30 here. We left dinner on the table, threw money on the table and jumped in a cab. This is history. This is Madonna, and she\u2019s trying to get the first woman in the White House. \u201d Was he satisfied with the show? \u201cOh my God,\u201d he said, \u201cit was everything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561707.3081324}
