[The lawsuit was filed in May 2016 by deputies working for President Barack Obama, who was ideologically opposed to any civic or legal recognition that men and women are biologically different as well as legally equal.  That   hostility towards biological heterosexuality is deeply unpopular among Americans, who prefer that civic society help women and men cooperate to ensure the next generation is birthed and educated. For example, most Americans recognize that women and men have a civil right to prefer their   institutions, including bathrooms, changing rooms and sports leagues. The decision to quit the   lawsuit was denounced by groups who are trying to impose a nationwide \u201cgenderless society\u201d which would suppress any civic or legal recognition of the differences between the two sexes. For example, Chase Strangio, a   activist at the ACLU complained that the decision by Trump\u2019s Attorney General Jeff Sessions means \u201cthere is no civil rights division\u201d at the agency. There is no civil rights division at DOJ anymore. We are the civil rights division. We are the resistance. And we will win.  \u2014   Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) April 14, 2017,  There is no civil rights division at DOJ anymore. We are the civil rights division. We are the resistance. And we will win.  \u2014   Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) April 14, 2017,  ACLU, @LambdaLegal, @ACLU_NC condemn Trump Administration\u2019s withdrawal of #HB2 lawsuit https:  .   \u2014   ACLU National (@ACLU) April 14, 2017,  The May 2016 lawsuit was filed then by Obama\u2019s Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and it demanded that the state\u2019s residents give up their civil right to have   public bathrooms and locker rooms for both biological sexes. The lawsuit was reinforced by Obama\u2019s directions to the nation\u2019s   schools, which told administrators to accept and support any child\u2019s claim they are transgender, to hide children\u2019s sexual claims from their parents, and to punish other  children who decline to use pronouns favored by a \u201ctransgender\u201d child   \u2014   such as \u201chim\u201d or her\u201d  \u2014   even in science class. In the lawsuit against North Carolina, Obama\u2019s lawyers claimed   facilities discriminate against men or women who want to live as members of the opposite sex. They insisted that 1970s civil rights laws actually require that a person\u2019s feeling about their maleness or femaleness, dubbed \u201cGender Identity,\u201d be treated as more important than their actual male or female heterosexual biology. \u201cTransgender men are men  \u2014   they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women  \u2014   they live, work and study as women,\u201d declared Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice\u2019s civic regulation division, in a May press conference. Gupta was forced out of the agency after Americans choose Trump as their new president in November. Since then, Obama has twice admitted that his focus on transgender ideology helped Trump win the election. On Friday, Gupta denounced the Justice Department\u2019s decision. Sadly predictable. They can dismiss but they cannot erase. The fight for LGBTQ justice is strong. https:  .   \u2014   Vanita Gupta (@vanitaguptaCR) April 14, 2017,  Despite pressure from business, the establishment and the sports industry, North Carolina\u2019s voters and legislators decided that the state officials will decide who is treated as a legal male or a legal female in the state. They passed HB2 in 2016, and then defeated a business boycott of the state by passing H142 in March 2017. Both laws were bitterly opposed by transgender activists because they reinforce the existing rules that treat men and women as equal, different and complementary in a heterosexual society, while also allowing people to flip their legal sex once they undergo a medical procedure. Transgender activists vowed to continue their lawsuit against the state, and their political campaign against the \u201cgender binary. \u201d The state\u2019s HB142 law is being defended in court by a Democratic Attorney General. But we\u2019re not backing down. Our lawsuit with @ACLU and @ACLU_NC will continue. We will keep fighting. #WeObject https:  .   \u2014   Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) April 14, 2017,  It is unclear if the Justice Department will fully switch sides and help defend the state\u2019s   HB142 law. The transgender hostility to heterosexual differences is deeply unpopular among Americans, and only about   of Americans support the idea that people should be allowed to easily change their legal sex. The number of transgender Americans is very low. Advocates claim that a third of one percent of Americans are at least somewhat transgender. But a study of the 2010 census showed that only about  400 adults had changed their name from one sex to the other.'"}, "time": 1742564243.5235202}
