They could be displaying the latest designer styles in Paris or New York, but instead they are here, in Istanbul, wearing high heels, flowing tunics and colorful head scarves. The fashion show, part of Istanbul Modest Fashion Week, was held at an   railway station, with   train cars and vintage luggage as props. This is not the Islamic fashion of Riyadh or Kabul, nor is it the dark and dreary dress stereotyped in the West. Islamic fashion here is a colorful, creative and joyful enterprise. It is also a huge business. \u201cWe\u2019re taking over,\u201d said Dina Torkia, a Muslim fashion blogger from London, who wears a head scarf and was mobbed by fans hoping for a photo. \u201cThere are a lot of us Muslim girls who wear the hijab, and we like fashion. \u201d As Europe grapples with the burkini  \u2014   a   swimsuit that some French beach towns have tried to ban as a symbol of the oppression of women  \u2014   Islamic dress in Turkey has become a symbol of religious freedom from the strictures of secularism. Istanbul has sought to become an Islamic fashion capital, an ambition that reflects the degree to which Turkish society has been reshaped under the Islamist government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Under Turkey\u2019s old   secular system, the head scarf, or hijab, was seen as a symbol of backwardness and banned in government offices and schools. In recent weeks, as France debated the burkini, Turkey again chipped away at old taboos, allowing female police officers, for the first time, to wear head scarves on the job. No longer an object of derision in Turkey  \u2014   and with the backing of the Islamist government  \u2014   the head scarf has spurred an Islamic fashion revolution, complete with fashion houses, magazines, bloggers and Instagram stars. Powerful women in the region, like Mr. Erdogan\u2019s wife, Emine, and Sheikha Mozah, a wife of a former emir of Qatar, have become fashion icons for young conservative women. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Muslim market? \u2019\u201d said Kerim Ture, a former technology industry executive who now runs the Islamic fashion house Modanisa, based in Istanbul. \u201cBlack burqas. That was the stereotype. \u201d Mr. Ture employs several   designers, and has partnerships with brands in Dubai and Malaysia. Popular colors these days are yellow and baby blue, as are camouflage and tropical leaf patterns. Saudi Telecom has invested in his company. \u201cOur main purpose is to make women feel better,\u201d he said. \u201cTo feel the glamour and the shine inside, even if they are covered. \u201d Mr. Ture said he did not come from an especially religious family, but he has supported Mr. Erdogan, whose policies, arguably, have made his business possible. \u201cMy mother is covered,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sister is not covered. It\u2019s a Turkish family. \u201d Mr. Ture organized the Istanbul Modest Fashion Week, the fancy affair held at the train station, in May, the city\u2019s first such event. Designers from around the Islamic world unveiled their collections there. But most of the models in the show were not Muslim. Russian and Eastern European models tend to be taller than Turkish women, Mr. Ture said, and are better able \u201cto carry the stuff, easier to show the glamour. \u201d One of the designers in the show was Loubna Sadoq, a Muslim woman in her 40s who lives in Amsterdam and began wearing a hijab a few years ago. \u201cI was on a religious journey, and I wanted more peace in my life,\u201d she said. Her new fashion sense, though, did not last long. \u201cI have another lifestyle,\u201d she said, mentioning bikinis and bars. \u201cBut I am still religious. I still pray. And I wear a scarf when I go to the mosque. \u201d Now she is an entrepreneur, selling head scarves made from natural fibers, like bamboo. Muslim fashion designers are essentially trying to answer a single question: How can a woman be fashionable and true to her religion at the same time? \u201cGod doesn\u2019t send in a fax, or email, of how we are going to be wearing things,\u201d Mr. Ture said. \u201cDon\u2019t be a sex object on the street for men. That\u2019s the message. Don\u2019t provoke them. \u201d Ms. Sadoq said the rules of Islamic dress were simple. \u201cThere is no difference between modest fashion and mainstream fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to adjust some things, like the length and width. You shouldn\u2019t see skin, and it shouldn\u2019t be tight. That\u2019s it. \u201d But as secular Turks fear religion encroaching on daily life, Turkey\u2019s conservative Muslims fear the opposite  \u2014   that Islam is becoming watered down by commercialism. A small group of conservative Muslims protested outside the fashion show, chanting, \u201cGod is great!\u201d One of the protesters, a man, told the gathering that the Quran is clear that women should be veiled, and he lamented that God\u2019s instructions have become \u201ca tool for the immorality called fashion. \u201d Some of the clothes displayed at the show seemed to push traditional boundaries: slightly   tops, a little skin here, a plunging neckline there. \u201cLengths got shorter, everything got tighter,\u201d said Gamze Ucar, 38, whose family runs a textile business and believes that some items worn by Muslim women nowadays violate Islamic rules. \u201cTrousers are everywhere. \u201d As the market for couture Islamic clothing has grown in recent years, mainstream designers have sought a piece of the action. DKNY and Tommy Hilfiger have designed Ramadan collections, and Dolce  Gabbana sells abayas, long outer garments, priced at more than $2, 000 apiece. Noor Tagouri, a journalist from the United States who has said she wants to be America\u2019s first   television anchor, said she often receives emails from Christians who say, \u201cWe like the clothes, but we are not Muslim. \u201d Her response: \u201cO. K. you can still wear it. You can still rock it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628538.5446484}
