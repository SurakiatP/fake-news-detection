A man known only by that alias has hired a lawyer from a prominent Manhattan firm to plead with two federal courts in five days to keep his name out of the impending prosecution of the alleged criminal conspiracy known broadly as Bridgegate. So far, he is winning the fight for anonymity. On Tuesday, an appellate court in Philadelphia blocked the scheduled release of a list of people who prosecutors believe were somehow involved in the scheme to tie up traffic at the New Jersey end of the bridge in September 2013. The court set a hearing on John Doe\u2019s appeal for June 6. So, the riddle of John Doe\u2019s identity and motivation will keep the politically curious guessing for a few more weeks, at the least. Who, they wondered, could have played a notable role in the highly publicized scheme and still hope to avoid being linked to it? And why did he wait until the eve of the scheduled release of the list of \u201cunindicted  \u201d to try to suppress it? \u201cThere are no coincidences in New Jersey politics,\u201d said John S. Wisniewski, a Democratic state assemblyman who was   of a legislative committee that investigated the   scheme. \u201cI\u2019m certain that there is an important reason for whoever John Doe is to have retained counsel, a reason that only recently came up. \u201d Whoever he is, Mr. Wisniewski said, John Doe had the resources and connections to hire Jenny Kramer, a former federal prosecutor who is now with the Chadbourne  Parke law firm. Ms. Kramer filed a motion in federal court in Newark last week, arguing that her client would be \u201cpublicly branded a felon\u201d by his inclusion on the list, even though he has not been charged with a crime. Prosecutors have not said how many names are on the list, but they have obtained indictments against only three former allies of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, suspected of plotting to tie up traffic in Fort Lee, N. J. They contend that the three  \u2014   Bill Baroni, David Wildstein and Bridget Anne Kelly  \u2014   sought to punish the borough\u2019s mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Mr. Christie for   in 2013. Mr. Baroni was the governor\u2019s top executive appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge. Mr. Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy last May, was a deputy to Mr. Baroni at the agency. Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly, who was a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, are scheduled to stand trial in September on nine counts, including conspiracy to commit fraud. Mr. Wildstein has stated that there is evidence that Mr. Christie knew about the scheme while it was being carried out, but the governor has said he found out about it afterward and quickly informed the public. Unless those denials have been refuted by prosecutors, Mr. Wisniewski said, \u201cit probably is unlikely that the governor is on this list. \u201d He declined to speculate about John Doe\u2019s identity, but trying to puzzle it out has been something of a parlor game among those who have continued to follow the case. Holly Schepisi, a Republican state assemblywoman who was on the committee with Mr. Wisniewski, called it a \u201cBridgegate fantasy league\u201d that had people swapping rosters of possibilities and wishes. \u201cThere are some people out there who still hold out hope, for whatever diabolical reason, that John Doe is somebody very senior,\u201d Ms. Schepisi said. Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science at Montclair State University, said in an interview on Tuesday that there was \u201cwidespread speculation\u201d that John Doe could be Mr. Christie. \u201cIt is someone who has an enormous amount to lose,\u201d Ms. Harrison said. \u201cWho has the most to lose?\u201d Ms. Harrison noted that Donald J. Trump, the Republican candidate for president, was scheduled to attend a rally in New Jersey on Thursday that will raise money to pay for Mr. Christie\u2019s aborted presidential campaign. \u201cSo there is at least some advantage he has gained from the delay of this,\u201d she said, referring to the governor. But Assemblywoman Schepisi said she was reasonably certain that John Doe was not Mr. Christie, but another current or former public official or government employee. Beyond that, she said, she had heard plenty of guesses, but \u201ceverybody\u2019s speculating. \u201d Susan Wigenton, the judge in the United States District Court in Newark who denied John Doe\u2019s motion to keep the list confidential, said that the public\u2019s right to know outweighed the interests of privacy of the people on the list, for \u201cwhom the government has sufficient evidence to designate as having joined the conspiracy. \u201d Ms. Schepisi said she thought John Doe had a strong argument against being implicated in a conspiracy without being charged and having a chance to defend himself. She said she imagined he had good reason to want to keep his presence on that list a secret. \u201cWhen people hear the phrase \u2018unindicted \u2019 the implication is no longer, unfortunately, O. K. you didn\u2019t commit a crime it is, you very probably did something criminal and somehow you skated,\u201d Ms. Schepisi said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a big scarlet letter put across your chest for the rest of your life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562956.2686558}
