This is absolutely ridiculous. Neither the Russian government nor any of its representatives have alluded to this. They are, however, calling for an international investigation regarding \u201cmurky details\u201d that surround the U.S. moon landings between 1969 and 1972. ( source )   Why a mainstream news outlet like the Washington Post would title an article \u201cRussian official wants to investigate whether U.S. moon landings actually happened \u201d is curious, to say the least ( source ) Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for Russia\u2019s official government Investigative Committee, has argued that such an investigation could bring to light what\u2019s been kept in the dark for a number of years with regards to these trips into outer space. Markin and the Russian government are referring to the disappearance of film footage from the original moon landing in 1969. They are also referring to the (approximately) 400 kilograms of lunar rock that was obtained during multiple missions between 1969 and 1972. \u201cWe are not contending that they did not fly (to the moon), and simply made a film about it. But all of these scientific \u2013 or perhaps cultural \u2013 artefacts are part of the legacy of humanity, and their disappearance without a trace is our common loss. An investigation will reveal what happened.\u201d\u2013 Vladimir Markin ( source ) From the U.S. side, NASA did admit that the original recordings of the first moon landing had been completely erased. Despite this, they also said that they had managed to remaster the original television broadcast of the landing.   According to Bob Dean, United States Army Command Sargent Major, who also served at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) of NATO as an intelligence analyst, there is more footage that has been erased and hidden than we\u2019ve not been told about: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, my government, NASA, which many of us in the United States say stands for Never A Straight Answer, proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film of the Apollo Program \u2014 the flight to the Moon, the flight around the Moon, the landings on the Moon, the walking guys here and there. They erased, for Christ\u2019s sake, 40 rolls of film of those events. Now we\u2019re talking about several thousand individual frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined that you did not have a right to see. Oh, they were \u2018disruptive,\u2019\u2018socially unacceptable,\u2019\u2018politically unacceptable.\u2019 I\u2019ve become furious. I\u2019m a retired Command Sergeant Major. I was never famous for having a lot of patience.\u201d (source) What Really Happened Out There? \\nFor anybody who has done any research regarding our trips to the moon, there is definitely no lack of mystery. A lot of this has been sparked by NASA astronauts themselves who have made some remarkable claims. There are so many statements from so many astronauts it\u2019s really hard to pick the best ones. \\nYou may instantly place this topic in the conspiracy realm, but with all of the evidence that\u2019s emerged within the past few years alone, nobody can rely have any sound rebuttal against it. Remember, a wise man once said that \u201ccondemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.\u201d \\n\u201cI happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomenon is real, although it\u2019s been covered up by governments for quite a long time. Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. We are not alone, they have been coming here for a long time.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 14, 6th man to walk on the moon. ( source )( source )( source )( source ) \u201cThere is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been monitoring us for a very long time. That their appearance is bizarre from any type of traditional materialistic western point of view. That these visitors use the technologies of consciousness, they use toroids, they use co-rotating magnetic disks for their propulsion systems, that seems to be a common denominator of the UFO phenomenon.\u201d ( source ) \u2013 Dr. Brian O\u2019Leary, Former NASA Astronaut and Princeton Physics Professor \u201cIn my opinion I think they were worried that it would panic the public if they knew that someone had vehicles that had this kind of performance \u2026 so they started telling lies about it. And then I think they had to cover another lie, you know, tell another lie to cover their first lie, now they don\u2019t know how to get out of it. Now it\u2019s going to be so embarrassing to admit that all these administrations have told a lot of untruths\u2026. [and that] there are a number of extraterrestrial vehicles out there cruising around.\u201d ( source ) \u2013 Gordon Cooper, Former NASA Astronaut, Aeronautical Engineer, and test pilot; one of the seven original astronauts in Project Mercury, the first manned space program of the United States \\n\u201cAt no time when the astronauts were in space were they alone. They were under constant surveillance by UFOs.\u201d\u2013 Maurice Chatelain, who worked at NASA. He holds 12 patents. His expertise was to invent radio equipment used to go to the moon. Here is an example of one of his patents.
