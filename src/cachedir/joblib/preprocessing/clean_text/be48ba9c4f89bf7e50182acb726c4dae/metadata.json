This Saturday\u2019s People\u2019s Climate March may take place in record temperatures, as forecasters say the mercury could reach the   degree mark. [Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, Virgin Airlines founder Richard Branson, and former vice president Al Gore are expected to attend, according to the Washington Post.  Tomorrow, we\u2019re marching for a better world. March with us and #BeInconvenient https:  .  #ClimateMarch pic. twitter.   \u2014   Al Gore (@algore) April 28, 2017,  The people backing the march range from the Communist Party USA, the Sierra Club, CODEPINK, and the Barack   Organizing for Action. But the man funding many of the organizations listed on the march\u2019s website as members of the steering committee have received millions of dollars from George Soros, the   billionaire who has deep roots in the U. S. environmental movement and other liberal causes. \u201cThe \u2018People\u2019s Climate March,\u2019 scheduled for the 100th day of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, claims to be a movement of the people. But is it really?\u201d Newsbusters reported on Friday. \u201cIt turns out   of the steering committee organizations have one thing in common  \u2014   donations from George Soros,\u201d Newsbusters reported. \u201cThe liberal billionaire gave them more than $36 million combined. \u201d \u201cBetween 2000 and 2014, Soros gave $36, 018, 461 million to 18 of the 55 steering committee members of the People\u2019s Climate March,\u201d Newsbusters reported. \u201cDonations to six of those groups were more $1 million each: Center for Community Change, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) People\u2019s Action, Public Citizen and Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201d Newsbusters noted that only three of these six organizations  \u2014   NRDC, Public Citizen and Union of Concerned Scientists  \u2014   have climate as all or part of their mission, calling into question why so many   focused groups are taking part in the march. \u201cThe presence of many   related organizations leading the march indicated that this climate march (just like the March for Science and the Women\u2019s March) is not about a single issue, but about attacking the new administration,\u201d Newsbusters reported. The People\u2019s Climate Change website states: Everything we have struggled to move forward in the United States is in peril. Our loved ones feel under siege, and those in power in Washington are advancing a dark and dangerous vision of America that we know is untrue. To change everything, we need everyone. On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, we will be in the streets of Washington D. C. to show the world and our leaders that we will resist attacks on our people, our communities and our planet. We will come together from across the United States to strengthen our movement. We will demonstrate our power and resistance at the gates of the White House. We will bring our solutions to the climate crisis, the problems that affect our communities and the threats to peace to our leaders in Congress to demand action. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports, \u201cEnvironmentalists will once again rally in the nation\u2019s capital this weekend, this time for the People\u2019s Climate March,\u201d noting that the march \u201cwill be more political and aimed at specific Trump administration policies. \u201d The Post said it\u2019s \u201cunclear\u201d just how many people will show up, but \u201corganizers are prepared to accommodate 50, 000 to 100, 000 people. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561691.0256798}
