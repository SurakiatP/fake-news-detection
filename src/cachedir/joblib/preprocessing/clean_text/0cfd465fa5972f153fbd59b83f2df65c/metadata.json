Our politicians and media have totally obscured the truth behind these and subsequent attacks that we call \u2018terrorism.\u2019 While we mourn 9/11, US B-52 heavy bombers are raining bombs on what\u2019s left of Afghanistan in a futile attempt to crush tribal forces (aka Taliban) fighting western occupation. \\nWe did the same thing in Laos in the 1980\u2019s, as President Barack Obama properly noted during his visit there last week. Laos has never recovered and Afghanistan won\u2019t either. \\nSince 2015, the US has dropped at least 32,000 \u2013 1,000-2,000 lb. bombs on Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and Afghanistan \u2013 all Muslim nations. US bomb inventories are running critically low as arms makers work overtime. \\n9/11 was a revenge attack conducted by mostly Saudi nationals who claimed they wanted to punish the United States for supporting Israeli oppression of Palestine, and for what they claimed was the US \u2018occupation\u2019 of Saudi Arabia. \\nThat\u2019s as much as we really know. We have never gotten the full story about 9/11. The best we can do is ask \u201cqui bono,\u201d who really benefitted from the attacks? \\nThe 9/11 narrative was immediately twisted by President George Bush into a spurious claim that America had been attacked by Muslims because of its \u2018freedoms\u2019 and her \u2018way of life.\u2019 This deceit opened the Pandora\u2019s box from which issued the rising wave of Islamophobia and Crusading fever sweeping over the US and Europe. \\nAmerica was attacked for what it had been doing all over the Muslim world, not for what it was. Most Americans don\u2019t know that the first CIA \u2018regime change\u2019 in the Mideast occurred in Syria, way back in 1948. We\u2019re still at it today. \\nEver since, the US, Britain and France \u2013 the imperial three musketeers \u2013 have been breaking and making regimes across the Mideast and Africa, and installing vicious dictators to do our bidding, earning enemies from West Africa to Tajikistan. \\nHillary Clinton said this week that if elected president she would advance \u2018American exceptionalism\u2019 and assure the new world order. These are code terms for imperialism and hegemony. If Clinton wins, look forward to foreign and military policy directed by Goldman Sachs and the neoconservatives. \\nDonald Trump vows a major increase military spending at a time when America\u2019s infrastructure is rusting or collapsing and its debt soaring. Both Trump and Clinton warn of growing security threats to America from ISIS and North Korea. In reality, the greatest internal threat is the type of Saturday night gang shoot-outs in Chicago that have killed 500 people so far this year. \\nISIS is a military pipsqueak \u2013 a bunch of 20-something hooligans. North Korea only wants to be left alone to its misery. Washington, Paris, and London need the ISIS bogeyman today, just as they needed al-Qaida and the Soviet Union before, to justify budget-busting new arms spending and keeping the population whipped up with bogus war fever. \\nInternationally, the greatest threat to America\u2019s security is, of course, nuclear armed Russia which has enough intercontinental and sea-launched missiles to wipe the United States off the map. Accordingly, Washington\u2019s most important foreign and national security priority is maintaining calm, well-mannered relations with Russia and its leadership. \\nInstead, we have Hillary Clinton and her frantic war party neocons trying to provoke Russia at every turn and giving Moscow the impression that she will start a war with Russia. It was precisely such war talk and sabre rattling that in 1983 during the Able Archer crisis brought the US and USSR to within minutes of a full-scale nuclear war. \\nFor all Trump\u2019s bluster and Islamophobia, he is absolutely right about seeking good relations with Moscow. The schoolyard demonization of Russian President Vladimir Putin by the Clinton camp and its tame US media is childish, shameful and unworthy of a great power.  '"}, "time": 1742628411.2601972}
