Keith Ellison (D-MN) already in the running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), another extremist is considering entering the race. Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, made a name for herself at the Democratic National Convention with a speech proclaiming that she had an abortion because a baby would interfere with her career plans. \\n\u201cI wanted a family, but it was the wrong time,\u201d Hogue said in her speech justifying her abortion. \\nA veteran of the \u201cprogressive\u201d movement, she worked for David Brock\u2019s Media Matters , a George Soros-funded group that works to push the media even further to the left by eliminating conservative news and viewers. She also worked for MoveOn.org, another Soros-funded group that got its name from a desire to \u201cmove on\u201d from Bill Clinton\u2019s disgraceful sexual affair with a White House intern, and stop the Republican Congress from impeaching the former president. Clinton was impeached by the House but not convicted in the Senate. \\nHogue\u2019s speech was described as the first time that a woman boasted about having an abortion at a national political party convention. Cecile Richards of Planned Parenthood, which performs abortions, said she was \u201cso proud\u201d to watch it. \\nHogue\u2019s old employer, Media Matters, said the speech was designed to eliminate the \u201cstigma\u201d that abortion is morally wrong and/or socially unacceptable, and that the media should have given it more attention. \\nBut the millions of Democrats who are pro-life, an estimated one in three, may not have appreciated the spectacle. \\nKristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, says , \u201cFor years, Democrats have been eroding their base of pro-life voters as abortion opponents flee to the Independent category and Republican Party. Democrats for Life of America staff have done an analysis that shows a close correlation between loss of pro-life Democratic seats and the overall decline of Democrats in Congress. The recent election reflects the party\u2019s shift to wholesale support for the abortion industry.\u201d \\nShe said the Democratic Party lost the November 8 election, \u201cthanks in large part to the party\u2019s extreme abortion position,\u201d and that \u201cthe party is slowly dying and on the way to being irrelevant if it does not start a dialogue with its pro-life members.\u201d \\nHillary Clinton supported abortion up until the moment of birth and advocated taxpayer funding of abortion. \\n\u201cStanding on a severe party platform on abortion, Hillary Clinton lost soft Republicans, anti-abortion Independents, and millions of pro-life voters in her own party,\u201d the group said. \u201cShe lost key states, long part of the Democrats\u2019 Blue Wall, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin\u2026\u201d If the Democratic Party continues moving left on the issue, she said, it risks becoming \u201cthe party of coastal, urban elites\u201d without support in Middle America. \\nHogue\u2019s group, NARAL Pro-Choice America, was established in 1969 as the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. NARAL\u2019s co-founder, Dr. Bernard N. Nathanson, was an abortionist who converted to the pro-life cause when he became convinced by science that the fetus was an unborn baby with the right to life. Later, he converted to Catholicism. \\nAnother important item on Hogue\u2019s resum\u00e9, her time serving as a \u201cSenior Advisor\u201d to the Soros-funded Media Matters, has become more significant after the release of one of the Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaks. It shows staffers for Media Matters attending the national Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in order to discover and expose \u201ctruly crazy\u201d views held by conservatives and wondering if any other liberals were there \u201con the sly\u201d to secretly monitor what was going on. \\nThe idea that women should celebrate abortion because it enables feminists to pursue careers may have been popular at the Democratic Party\u2019s convention, but it is not considered morally acceptable by many people, including women. \\n\u201cWhat Hogue and NARAL don\u2019t seem to grasp is that their definition of feminism, along with the targeting of a weaker individual\u2014a woman\u2019s own child\u2014diminishes women as a whole,\u201d countered Carole Novielli at Live Action News. \u201cThe sign of a strong woman is not in how quickly she will sacrifice her own flesh and blood for personal ambition, but in how she maintains her dignity and that of her child while working through a challenging situation to find real solutions.\u201d \\nFormer abortionist Nathanson said in an interview that the abortion rights movement used deception and dirty tricks to make abortion legal and socially acceptable in the United States. One tactic, he said, was to depict Catholic opponents of abortion as \u201csocially backward.\u201d He said \u201cthe media drum-fired all this into the American people, persuading them that anyone opposing permissive abortion must be under the influence of the Catholic hierarchy and that Catholics in favor of abortion are enlightened and forward-looking.\u201d \\nAs revealed in the Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks, the same strategy is still being used today. John Halpin, a senior fellow for the Soros-funded Center for American Progress, referred to Catholic beliefs on sexuality matters as \u201cseverely backwards.\u201d \\nPhiladelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput cited this and other material in the emails as evidence that the Clinton entourage was \u201criddled with anti-Catholic bigots.\u201d He noted that Sandy Newman, president of Voices for Progress, had emailed Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta to ask about whether \u201cthe bishops opposing contraceptive coverage\u201d in Obamacare could be the tinder for a revolution. \u201cThere needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages [sic] dictatorship,\u201d Newman wrote. \\n\u201cOf course it would be wonderful for the Clinton campaign to repudiate the content of these ugly WikiLeaks emails,\u201d Chaput said. \u201cAll of us backward-thinking Catholics who actually believe what Scripture and the Church teach would be so very grateful.\u201d \\nRather than repudiate the emails, a pro-abortion feminist who is proud of her abortion is now apparently in the running for the position of DNC chair. \\nIf she does run, The Huffington Post says the DNC contest could be seen in \u201cprogressive circles as a proxy do-over of the Sanders-Hillary Clinton Democratic primary, with all the acrimony that came with it.\u201d Ellison backed Sanders and Hogue supported Hillary. \\nHogue was photographed on the verge of tears as the news came in on election night that Clinton was going down to defeat. Cheers, not tears, greeted her news at the convention that she had an abortion because having a baby was an inconvenience.
