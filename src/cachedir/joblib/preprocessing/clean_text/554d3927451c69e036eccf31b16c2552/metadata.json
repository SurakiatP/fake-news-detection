These are agents of change for life, and they are willing to use any means necessary to tips the scales into something they can work with. There is every indication that the agenda is to stir social unrest and further division, and with enough fake riots and manufactured anger, things might lead to a full-fledged civil war in America. Problem. Reaction. Solution. \\nLou Dobbs called for Soros to be investigated and held liable for inciting riots that are causing property damage and personal harm:\\nShould DOJ investigate Soros & his links to non-profits for their role in inciting riots that have caused property damage & personal injury?\\n\u2014 Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) November 12, 2016 \\n\\nOne has to wonder how man degrees away this network is from those that appear to be involved in staging tragedies (such as shootings and terrorist events) for media exploit.

Madsen writes, \u201cThe Purple Revolution will resist all efforts by the Trump administration to push back against the globalist policies of the Clintons and soon-to-be ex-President Barack Obama. The Purple Revolution will also seek to make the Trump administration a short one through Soros-style street protests and political disruption.\u201d\\nWe KNOW who is behind this, and we are putting them on notice, there will be a changing of the guard on January 20th, 2017. Who will protect you from the long arm of the law then? \\n\\nThis article was written by SGT Report and originally published at SGTReport.com . '"}, "time": 1742628441.3413131}
