The bullet sped toward    Carlos Vasquez, who ran just steps ahead of the gunman. But it missed its mark, just outside the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx, and kept whistling through the air. It sailed for 150 yards along East 154th Street, down the slope between Courtlandt and Elton Avenues, staying airborne as the ground fell away. Maribel Cavero, 45, was crossing the street at the base of that hill, unaware that a shot had been fired during a running fight between young men in the housing project. She had just delivered a carton of sugar substitute to her diabetic grandmother on East 154th Street and was on her way to pick up her    niece from school. The bullet slowed and tumbled as it dropped. Then, with the last of its fading energy, it tore into Ms. Cavero. Alejandro Almonte, 45, a   heard Ms. Cavero yelp and saw her fall. He later said he thought she must have had a seizure. He ran to where she lay, facedown, on the blacktop by a small car\u2019s bumper. She was dying, the bullet having pierced her heart at about 12:50 p. m. on Nov. 2, a sunny Wednesday. The slug passed through her chest and rolled to a stop under a Jeep parked near a   house at 426 East 154th Street. The bullet was strangely pristine, hardly deformed by its deadly work. As investigators began to piece together how the woman had been shot, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, looked uphill, where the bullet had been fired, and downhill, where it had come to rest, and surveyed the maze of telephone poles, streetlights, wires, cars and trees in between. The bullet had improbably traveled nearly two city blocks to strike an unintended victim and log the precinct\u2019s 14th  \u2014   and final  \u2014   homicide of 2016. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have hit a tree?\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cA light pole? A sign?\u201d It was grim news for detectives in the 40th Precinct, where The New York Times has been examining every homicide logged in 2016, a succession of   assassinations, gang killings, domestic murders and random slayings. Half the cases remained unsolved, and Sergeant LoPuzzo\u2019s investigators were already struggling to find the person responsible for the fatal shooting of another innocent bystander, Jessica White, cut down on a playground in June. Now, less than a mile away and five months later, the police had another mystery and another blameless bystander lying crumpled on the ground. Detectives were initially unable to explain what had happened. The mayor\u2019s office called the chief of detectives, and the chief of detectives called Sergeant LoPuzzo. The message was simple: Do all you can. The department flooded the streets with rookies who picked through trash and shined flashlights in alleyways and sewer grates searching for any potential evidence. Detectives checked Ms. Cavero\u2019s background for clues. The head of Bronx detectives, Deputy Chief Jason Wilcox, stalked the streets between the projects and the businesses on Third Avenue, the area around him abuzz with the police. It was a striking show of force, and a marked escalation from the police response after Ms. White was killed as she tried to shield her children from gunfire. As the afternoon hours wore on, Sergeant LoPuzzo and his detectives started getting breaks. Things lined up in ways they seldom do in this part of the Bronx, where witnesses rarely agree to testify and investigative staffing is one of the lowest in the city despite a   rate that is the highest. By late the next night, Orlando Oquendo, a    who the police believed had fired the bullet, was in handcuffs, having been identified in a lineup by Mr. Vasquez, the man who said he was the target. Mr. Oquendo, who still looked very much a teenager, had been arrested several times, including twice on gun possession charges, according to court documents and his mother. \u201cThat kid was on a road,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cIt was just a matter of time. \u201d Less than 48 hours elapsed from death to arrest, and what detectives in this corner of the city say they hope for but rarely see came to pass: The police and the people in the community had cooperated to solve a killing. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to read like a book,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said weeks later, explaining how he wished all cases went that way. \u201cWhere you can read all the steps in the investigation, and what they saw and what they found and what the video shows and what the evidence shows. So it\u2019s all one big package. \u201d It was a luxury, the sergeant said, his squad often did not have. The day she died, Maribel Cavero and her    mother, Maria Reyes, had cooked crabs for an early lunch, using a recipe from their native Ecuador. Together, with Ms. Cavero\u2019s younger sister, Alexandra Cavero, 44, they sat at a small table in the family\u2019s   apartment in the Melrose Houses, only a block from the corner where the shot would be fired. Ms. Cavero regaled them with family gossip and news from their home country. The sisters had joined their mother in the United States in 2008, about 12 years after she followed her own mother from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to the South Bronx in hopes of more earnings and a better life. When lunch was finished, Ms. Cavero\u2019s mother reminded her to drop off the box of sugar substitute to her grandmother, Marcela Troncoso, the    family matriarch, who lived in an apartment on East 154th Street. As she did most days, Ms. Cavero was headed to pick up her sister\u2019s    daughter, Gabriela Encalada, from school, because her sister had to leave for her job as a bus driver. But Ms. Cavero would make time for the delivery. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m in a hurry, but I\u2019ll do it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Reyes said in a recent interview. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll do it. \u2019\u201d Ms. Cavero had no husband, no boyfriend and no children, her relatives said. She enjoyed certain solitary pursuits, like romance novels and the online game FarmVille. And aside from family, her regular social activity was Mass at Immaculate Conception Church on East 150th Street. \u201cShe lived in her own world,\u201d her sister said. \u201cShe was still very na\u00efve. \u201d With what relatives called a tranquil focus, she poured her energy into caring for her mother and helping to raise her niece, whom she considered like a daughter. She loved tragic poetry, her sister said, and the writings of Pablo Neruda and the novels of Cor\u00edn Tellado, a prolific romance writer. At night, she would watch Elvis Presley movies, referring to the singer as her eternal love. She watched James Bond movies, too, but told friends she avoided real romantic entanglements because in her view they always brought pain. \u201cIn high school, they used to say she seemed like she was in love because when she was into a book, into a piece of literature, she expressed it, and the others would tell her, \u2018You\u2019re in love,\u2019 and her answer would be \u2018Yes, I\u2019m in love with life,\u2019\u201d her sister said. \u201c\u2018In some ways you seem like a little girl, and in some ways you\u2019re like an old lady,\u2019 I used to tell her. \u201d Ms. Cavero worked for a few years as a   nanny, her mother said. But as the children she watched grew, the $   job ended and she wound up working another job her stepfather found for her at a McDonald\u2019s on Sixth Avenue and 28th Street in Manhattan. The shifts began late in the day, which gave her time to pick up Gabriela. But they often ended near midnight. Coming home that late, she usually called her mother to tell her she was leaving work. Her mother said Ms. Cavero was afraid of the neighborhood. \u201cThis is a bad place here,\u201d Ms. Reyes said. \u201cSometimes gunfights are heard outside. \u201d When the McDonald\u2019s was being remodeled in the fall, Ms. Cavero seized the opportunity to go to Ecuador. She stayed for 45 days with her father, Luis Cavero. She wasn\u2019t thrilled to return to New York, where she had been frustrated in finding meaningful work, and she talked of moving home once her niece was older, her sister said. \u201cWhy did this happen?\u201d her sister asked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. She was a person who had no vices. \u201d For the investigation into Ms. Cavero\u2019s killing, finding the small, smooth slug under a Jeep near the body was the case\u2019s first big break. Detectives who found it cordoned off the area with crime scene tape. One hunched down, unloaded the magazine of his own   pistol and pulled out a bullet to compare. The slugs were the same size. Another bystander told officers he had seen a man running wildly with something black in his hand through the Melrose playground a block and a half away. Detectives traced a ballistic path westward along East 154th Street and found a plumber who told them he had seen the shooting as he walked with his lunch from the Twin Deli Grocery at East 154th and Courtlandt. The plumber told detectives he saw one young man chase another, then stop and raise his arm. He heard a gunshot and the tinkle of a brass shell hitting the sidewalk as the gunman turned back and sprinted into the Melrose Houses. The shell was there, under some scaffolding, on the northeast corner, and detectives placed a white foam cup over it to preserve it as evidence. After detectives went looking for surveillance video, they found footage from at least five nearby stores and buildings, a bonanza in a neighborhood where security cameras are scarce and often out of order. One video showed a teenager racking a gun, dropping something, then firing. On the street, besides the shell casing, detectives discovered an object they believed had also fallen from the gunman\u2019s hands: a silver cigarette lighter. Television satellite trucks began showing up, a rare but welcome sight for investigators in this part of the city, who hoped publicity might encourage witnesses to come forward. The evening news broadcasts were soon underway, and in a place where even horrific killings often draw only brief coverage, the local stations were going big with the news of an innocent bystander shot dead. For Sergeant LoPuzzo, a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes does nothing to blunt his frustration over witnesses who will not speak. In case after case, as recently as a shooting on New Year\u2019s Day, even seriously injured victims tell a similar story: \u201cFelt pain, saw nothing. \u201d But the Cavero case was already going differently, and then a call came from the 40th Precinct station house on Alexander Avenue. Detectives told the sergeant, who was still at the scene, that a man had walked into the   squad room claiming to have been in the gunman\u2019s cross hairs. \u201cI said, \u2018Do not let him leave,\u2019\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo recalled. Within minutes, the man, Carlos Vasquez, was putting his account in writing in front of a detective. In his statement, he said he saw the news of Ms. Cavero\u2019s death on television and realized \u201cthat a woman was shot and killed by the bullet that was intended for me. \u201d \u201cI informed my family that I was going to the precinct so I can tell the detectives what happened and tell them I wanted this guy brought to justice,\u201d he said in his statement, which both he and a detective signed. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the rare things where he\u2019s got a conscience,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo later said. Mr. Vasquez had been arrested more than a dozen times and had been convicted of drug dealing and illegal possession of a knife. He was a   if   drug dealer. He sold in the Melrose Houses near the corner of East 153rd Street and Courtlandt Avenue, where his mother lived, according to court records and the police. In implicating Mr. Oquendo, Mr. Vasquez never explained how the fight had started. In his own words, he said he had left his building on Nov. 2 \u201cin search of marijuana\u201d and was waiting for a dealer near a flagpole at the neighboring Jackson Houses when two men assaulted him. He ran. But before he could make it to the safety of his mother\u2019s house, one of the assailants closed the gap, with a gun in hand. \u201cAs I\u2019m running, I turn around to see him point a gun at me and fire it,\u201d Mr. Vasquez said in his statement, though he did not know Mr. Oquendo\u2019s name. \u201cI ducked between cars. \u201d Even before Mr. Vasquez came in, detectives reviewing the recovered video images from the deli\u2019s cameras thought they had identified a suspect. Officers assigned to a plainclothes   unit recognized the person in the surveillance footage as Mr. Oquendo, the teenager with a lengthy arrest record who was known to officers as \u201cGumby. \u201d The case detective, Ivan Monge, also knew the gunman when he saw the video. He had arrested Mr. Oquendo\u2019s older sister on assault charges in October. \u201cI told myself, \u2018Wait, this is Gumby, this is Oquendo,\u2019\u201d he said. Detectives did not recover the gun. But with the videos, the witnesses, the bullet, the shell casing and the name of the suspect lining up, Sergeant LoPuzzo\u2019s team made one more breakthrough: Detective David Rodriguez remembered that the suspect\u2019s mother was an old neighbor of his from Spanish Harlem. They had grown up together, their families had attended the same church and they had spoken after one of Mr. Oquendo\u2019s previous arrests. The detective contacted the mother\u2019s relatives on Facebook and eventually got her on the phone. He told her he needed her to bring in her son safely. \u201cLike a mother, she didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Detective Rodriguez said. \u201cAnd she wanted the proof. \u201d Detective Rodriguez went to her home and took her to the squad room, where he showed her a wanted flier with an image of her son taken from the videos. She came in only \u201cbecause she trusted him,\u201d said Detective John Caruso, another detective working on the case. Finally she broke down. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said, according to Detective Rodriguez, \u201cthat\u2019s my son. \u201d By the next night, the detectives were packed in the lobby of the Legal Aid Society\u2019s office on East 161st Street in the Bronx. Steven Mechanic, a veteran public defender who had represented Mr. Oquendo against several criminal charges in the past, surrendered him to the police. \u201cThere are no winners in this case,\u201d Mr. Mechanic said later, declining to discuss the new charges or Mr. Oquendo\u2019s previous convictions. Mr. Oquendo was led away. His parents cried. \u201cHe told me he came over from Cuba on a boat, 20 years ago,\u201d Detective Rodriguez said of the suspect\u2019s father. \u201cI know the mother\u2019s side of the family personally. I\u2019ve known them for years. He comes from a good family, but everyone takes their own path in life. \u201d Orlando Oquendo\u2019s mother sat in her living room in the Jackson Houses one recent night, with a stack of letters written by her son in jail piled on her lap. She nodded toward the streets outside her   window and spoke of her son\u2019s sorrow for Ms. Cavero\u2019s death. \u201cIf he did do it, it was not intentional. It was not toward her,\u201d she said of the shooting. \u201cA person was lost, so it\u2019s going to hurt. \u201d She felt a kinship for Ms. Cavero\u2019s family. Both were Latino families, she said, one from Puerto Rico and Cuba, the other from Ecuador. Both were churchgoing, and both were living in a   area they wanted to escape. Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother said that taking the apartment in the Jackson Houses 11 years ago was the worst decision she had ever made. Mr. Oquendo, the fourth of her six children, was troubled and, from a young age, attended a special school for emotionally disturbed children. It was hard to stay neutral in the project\u2019s   gang feuds, and he got into fights constantly. He seemed unable to back down from a threat. He would not \u201cstay shut\u201d when challenged, said his mother, who spoke on the condition that her name not be published. \u201cHe had good hands. He could defend himself. \u201d Twice, her son was accused of crimes involving guns, according to court documents and law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential records. In February 2014, a young woman told the police that Mr. Oquendo, who was 15, fired several shots at her, one official said. He was indicted on a gun possession charge in that case, which was transferred to family court and sealed. Then, in August 2015, he was arrested when a police officer saw him drop a .  revolver wrapped in a   on Courtlandt Avenue near East 157th Street, a criminal complaint said. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was given a conditional discharge, the official said. Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother said he was supposed to be graduating from high school this month and then going to work for his father\u2019s plumbing business. Her son had been coaching young basketball players at the local Classic Community Center, on the courts where Chris McCullough of the Brooklyn Nets once reigned. He had proposed to his longtime girlfriend, telling her they could someday move to a safer neighborhood with their son, O. J. born on Aug. 16. \u201cIf this kid could relive this day, I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t do the same thing that he did,\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cBut once you pull that trigger, you can\u2019t pull that back. \u201d Still, the pressures were mounting, said Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother, who referred to him as her \u201cprayer baby\u201d for his constant comfort of her. He watched her battle diabetes and heart disease and saw his maternal grandmother dying of colon cancer. The streets enveloped him, she said. In October, he had a dispute with Mr. Vasquez outside a local barbershop. On the day of the shooting, Mr. Vasquez\u2019s nephew, a friend of the Oquendo family, sent messages to Mr. Oquendo\u2019s sister to find out what had happened. After speaking with Detective Rodriguez, Mr. Oquendo\u2019s mother reached her son and asked him to surrender. \u201cI told him, \u2018The best thing to do is to turn yourself in, and let\u2019s see what happens,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my son out on the run. \u201d Now, he is in a Rikers Island jail cell, facing a   indictment on murder and other charges. He turned 18 there and spent Thanksgiving and Christmas alone. But his letters and cards keep coming, almost daily, filled with apologies for letting his mother down and promising to come home. In a letter on Dec. 30, he told her not to worry, writing, \u201cGod has a plan,\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s hope God gives us a short, easy punishment. \u201d Ms. Cavero\u2019s relatives, who are tracking the suspect\u2019s court appearances, are afraid of just that: a light sentence. Detectives said that Mr. Oquendo\u2019s intended victim, Mr. Vasquez, picked him out of a police lineup, but that the plumber who witnessed the shooting had been too afraid to try the same. DNA tests on the silver lighter recovered near the shell casing were inconclusive. In her living room, two blocks from the Oquendo family, Ms. Cavero\u2019s mother, Ms. Reyes, also sat on a couch with a pile of envelopes, these containing court papers and other official documents. She thought back to the moment the police informed her of her daughter\u2019s killing. Detective Monge, the case detective, had knocked on her door to deliver the news in Spanish, and she was grateful for his compassion. But even after a wake, in which her daughter was dressed all in white, and a funeral, in Ecuador, she said the randomness of the death  \u2014   in which a person with no enemies or vices was taken violently  \u2014   remained the abiding mystery. It is a question the police cannot answer. \u201cThat is what I ask myself,\u201d Ms. Reyes said, tears falling down her cheeks. \u201cWhy did this happen this way?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563578.4050534}
