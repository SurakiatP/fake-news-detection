A story in The Times on Wednesday explores how the war between the presidential candidates might also lead to war at family dinner. Do you take the year off? Do you put a moratorium on politics at the table? You could. Or you could let Sam Sifton show you how to make a gravy so good it heals all divides. Sam runs the New York Times Food section, operates the paper\u2019s Cooking app, does a column for The Times Magazine and actually wrote the book on Thanksgiving  \u2014   2013\u2019s amusing, invaluable \u201cThanksgiving: How to Cook It Well. \u201d On the latest episode of Still Processing, Sam has advice for orchestrating a smooth, enjoyable feast. And so do we. (To start, make extra gravy. \u201cThanksgiving this year is going to be tough enough without skimping on the gravy,\u201d Jenna says.) Sam had us over to his wonderful kitchen in Red Hook, Brooklyn, to instruct us on making that gravy (Wondra: who knew?) and talk about the rules for peace, harmony and, if you\u2019re going that route, potluck. \u201cThis Thanksgiving is gonna be different for lots of folks all across the country,\u201d Sam says. \u201cSome families will be largely jubilant with some   people in the corner of the table. And others will be largely sad with some jubilant outliers. . .. And if you find yourself as the outlier in one of those situations, as many Americans will at Thanksgiving, I think we just gotta  \u2014   this year and perhaps always  \u2014   practice radical acceptance of where you are and who you\u2019re with. \u201d \u201cThe best ways to find those connections and that community is over food,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mess with the food too much. \u201d The Food section has an entire feature on Thanksgiving from all cultures, from all over the country, that is like being in 50 kitchens at the same time. If you\u2019re taking a break from your own family\u2019s dinner, let your mouth water at the ones the Food section discovered. Bon app\u00e9tit, y\u2019all.
