He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years,\u201d the star\u2019s publicist, Leslee Dart, said in a statement to Variety. \u201cThis is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject. \u201d   is the only actor to have won three Best Actor Academy Awards (Jack Nicholson and Walter Brennan each won three apiece, but not all in the lead Actor category) for his roles in Lincoln (2012) There Will Be Blood (2007) and My Left Foot (1989).
