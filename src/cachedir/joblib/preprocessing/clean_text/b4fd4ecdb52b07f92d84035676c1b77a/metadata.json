Three arrests in under a week is a tremendous result. \\n\u201c We don\u2019t know at this stage how long Gerrard has been back in the UK for, but he told our officers that the pressure of being on the run had got too much for him . \\n\u201c The fugitives on our Most Wanted list really do have nowhere to hide. I would urge any of the remaining ones to take note \u2013 save yourself the trouble and hand yourself in because we will never stop hunting you and you will face justice, \u201d he added. \\nCrimestoppers director of operations Roger Critchell said: \u201c The fact Robert Gerrard handed himself in to police is again an indication that when the pressure mounts, hiding places become harder to find. \\n\u201c This is a great result as it follows two fugitive arrests in the last week from our sister campaign targeting those on the run in Spain. These campaigns really do work .\u201d \\nHis next hearing will be at Manchester Magistrates\u2019 Court on November 23. \\nVia RT .
