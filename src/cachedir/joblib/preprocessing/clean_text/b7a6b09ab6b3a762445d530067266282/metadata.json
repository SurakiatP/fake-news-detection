But since then it\u2019s all been back to the Britain we know and hate \u2013 sex abuse, measles outbreaks, HMV going under, your failing post-war-era Health Service, David Cameron, how do you people cope?\u2019 \\nThe news came as a surprise to analysts, who had predicted that up to 25,000 Romanian and Bulgarian jobseekers would arrive at Heathrow each day. BAA Ltd, the owners of Heathrow, had already warned that this would be \u2018roughly 24,990 more than we can cope with per day\u2019 and even hinted that queues could develop in the arrivals lounge. \\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage was \u2018incensed\u2019 by the news. \u2018It\u2019s a shocking insult to the people of Britain,\u2019 said Farage. \u2018We\u2019ve been preparing a well-honed tirade of crackpot dogma, frosty glares and grumbling about the strain on public services to welcome these people to this country, only to find they\u2019re only interested in coming if there are jobs! That\u2019s the problem with foreign freeloaders, they just aren\u2019t willing to put the work in. What am I going to do with this \u2018Boris Out\u2019 placard now? I can\u2019t possibly use it for any other political purpose.\u2019 \\nFor Domescu, the final straw came during the funeral of Margaret Thatcher last week. \u2018I was still thinking of coming to Britain, but then they broadcast those pictures of your Chancellor Osborne openly weeping on national television and it finally hit home how bad things must be for that to happen,\u2019 she said. \u2018So I\u2019ll just stay here after all \u2013 the weather\u2019s far nicer and I hear there\u2019s a job going at the local horse abattoir.\u2019 Share this story...'"}, "time": 1742561854.7403464}
