There\u2019s no one better. \u201d  Lee said, \u201cThis is an outstanding nominee. I\u2019ve argued in front of this judge, when he was sitting on the 10th Circuit, where he now sits. He\u2019s an outstanding judge, and extraordinary. There\u2019s no one better. He\u2019s the kind of judge every lawyer wants to argue in front of, because he\u2019s the kind of judge who reads every opinion, every brief, every citation. And he seeks to decide each case on the basis of the law and facts in front of him. This is the kind of judge we want sitting on the US Supreme Court, someone who reads the law in an effort to decide what it says, rather than what he wishes it said. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564048.3118012}
