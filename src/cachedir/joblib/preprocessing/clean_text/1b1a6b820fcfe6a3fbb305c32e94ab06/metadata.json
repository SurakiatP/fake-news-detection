S. government will be prohibited from giving any money to the UN, or any of its affiliates, until President Barack Obama confirms the UN resolution has been repealed and can certify that he has done so. America provides the UN with 22 percent of its budget, contributing $8 billion to the largely   organization annually.  \u201cUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 falsely claims that Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the eastern part of Jerusalem and Jewish communities in the West Bank are illegal under international law, and that the Old City of Jerusalem, along with the Temple Mount, the holiest site for the Jewish people, and the Western Wall are \u2018occupied Palestinian territory,\u2019\u201d the Safeguard Israel Act states. The  December 23   resolution 2334 passed nearly unanimously despite the Obama administration\u2019s decision to break with tradition and abstain from voting instead of vetoing it. Because the United States is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, an American veto would have automatically stopped the resolution and prevented it from passing. \u201cPresident Obama betrayed decades of robust bipartisan American support for Israel at the United Nations by permitting the passage of a biased resolution that condemns our close friend and ally,\u201d Sen. Cruz said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Thursday morning. \u201cThe Security Council\u2019s resolution is only the latest example of the UN\u2019s long history of obsessive hostility towards Israel. \u201d Sen. Graham said, \u201cI begged the UN months before, don\u2019t put me in this box. I think most Americans believe the United Nations has become more   more  . \u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m a big internationalist, but we\u2019re gonna stop the money until we get this fixed. \u201d The Safeguard Israel Act also notes that during his final address to the UNSC on December 16, outgoing UN   Ban   admitted UN bias against Israel when he stated, \u201cDecades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports, and conferences criticizing Israel. \u201d The legislation adds, the \u201cUnited Nations passes more resolutions condemning Israel than any other country in the world. \u201d Last week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on a   vote objecting to the Security Council vote. Despite strong bipartisan support for the measure, at least 75 Democrats and four Republicans voted against it many of the opposing Democrats accused Republicans of introducing HR 11 to attack Obama unfairly in the last two weeks of his presidency. Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( ) Rep. David Price ( ) and Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) were among Democrats to vote against HR 11.
