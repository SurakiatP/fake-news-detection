[\u201cNot because it would have prevented Friday\u2019s attack but surely we should be able to withdraw Swedish residency rights from people who support violent extremism,\u201d wrote the Greater Gothenburg police chief on Sunday, two days after an alleged terror attack in Stockholm in which four people died and many were injured.  But government minister Morgan Johansson slapped down Nord\u2019s \u201cproblematic\u201d suggestion, for which he said the police chief needs to \u201cexplain himself\u201d. \u201cWe have freedom of speech in Sweden. This means people have the right to hold repulsive opinions here,\u201d said Johansson. \u201cBut there are always limits  \u2026     For example when it comes to hate speech,\u201d he added. Asserting that migrants with residence permits are in Sweden because they are in need of protection, the Social Democratic party politician warned that \u201cthere is a risk [migrants who support violent extremism] could face persecution if they were sent back\u201d. Nord told the Gothenburg Post on Sunday: \u201cWe should be able to tell   who are going around proposing the nation become a totalitarian state, be it political or religious, that they have to go back home where they belong. \u201d Noting how currently Sweden can only deport individuals found guilty of committing or funding acts of terror, the police chief argued that it should also be possible for the nation to expel people who say they support groups which back violent extremism. \u201cSure there are going to be people who say ISIS is great and that religious extremism is fantastic. But then I don\u2019t think these people should be allowed to stay in Sweden where they are bankrolled and have their lifestyles paid for by the government. \u201d \u201cIslam itself is not extreme, but there are forms of Islamism and jihad which are causing problems,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt this point in time, we know that there are many people going around and giving lectures in support of this sort of extremism. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair,\u201d Nord added, telling the newspaper that police receive intelligence about Islamist preachers \u201call the time\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that we allow bad people to canvass here, waving ISIS flags,\u201d said Nord. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to those who have fled from Islamic State. \u201d \u201cI realise that the things I\u2019m saying here could be read as political statements. But we\u2019re living in a new reality now in which, sometimes, it\u2019s important that we be allowed to talk about things we observe,\u201d he told Expressen.'"}, "time": 1742628307.0114145}
