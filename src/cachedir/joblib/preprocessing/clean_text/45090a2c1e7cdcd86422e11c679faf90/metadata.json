[  of ESPN\u2019s \u201cRussillo and Kanell Show,\u201d Ryen Russillo admits that since politics became so pervasive in sports talk, he no longer knows what his job is anymore. He came to his current profession because he loves to talk about sports, but that appears to be an outdated business model.  \u201cNow I feel like if I\u2019m not doing a social awareness show three out of five days a week, I feel like I\u2019m doing it wrong,\u201d Russillo lamented during his show. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly think that\u2019s the play,   for what I\u2019m supposed to do as a sports talk show host for the next 10 years. \u201d The    from Laramie Wyoming, who has   the show since 2009, added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. If I were doing the   show three days a week, would I have 90% support from  ? Because that\u2019s what it feels like right now. \u201d Russillo found it funny that another ESPN host Dan Le Batard criticized an ESPN memo instructing hosts not to talk about Trump\u2019s current immigration ban. Russillo said, \u201cLike, I think the majority of everybody I work with does all the time  \u2026     I saw a show the other day tease that one of the hosts was upset about the travel ban. That was the tease for a show. Can you imagine if I teased this show and said, \u2018Coming up, why all of you are wrong about Trump, and why he\u2019s awesome. \u2019\u201d Russillo knows all too well that ESPN and other sports networks wouldn\u2019t be keen on that idea, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really weird that the job now feels like you have to have a take, and it better be along the lines of so many other people in the media or you\u2019re just gonna be uncool, you\u2019re gonna be ostracized. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562816.6130853}
