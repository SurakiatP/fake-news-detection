(Photo by AFP) \\nOne of the most important questions is will US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton rig the election to win the White House like she did in the primaries against Bernie Sanders, asks Myles Hoenig, an American political analyst and activist. \\nRecent polls show that Clinton\u2019s national lead over Trump is shrinking as the Election Day is approaching. \\nThe former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. \\nLibertarian candidate Gary Johnson has 3 percent support among likely voters, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein has 2 percent support. \\n\u201cIn every election the race tightens towards the end,\u201d Hoenig told Press TV on Thursday. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other. With Obama and Romney, or even Gore and Bush, many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president, regardless of who was pulling whose strings,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cThis election is more polarized than ever. With the Podesta leaks showing Clinton\u2019s overt racism (calling Donna Brazille a buffalo) as well as proving that President Obama lied to the public about when he learned of Clinton\u2019s inappropriate use of her emails, and with the news of Trump\u2019s ACCESS Hollywood tape receding into America\u2019s short term memory span, it\u2019s no wonder the polls are tightening,\u201d the analyst stated. \\n\u201cThe question of the day is will Clinton rig the election like she did the primary, being the only way she could have won,\u201d he asked. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing both Johnson\u2019s and Stein\u2019s numbers dropping but so many are not polled that those numbers are harder to verify,\u201d the commentator noted. \\n\u201cThis is the biggest crap shoot of an election in years!\u201d he said in his concluding remarks.
