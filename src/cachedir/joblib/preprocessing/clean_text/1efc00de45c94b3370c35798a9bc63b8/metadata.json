Trump has been very vocal about his creepy sexual fetishization of his daughter Ivanka \u2013 and yet another deeply uncomfortable video has surfaced of him hitting on his daughter. \\nDuring a 2013 tapping of the \u201c Wendy Williams Show ,\u201d Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka appeared together as guests. \\nWendy asked each to name what they have in common, during a reoccurring segment called \u201cFave Five.\u201d While Ivanka safely and logically responded, \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201cgolf.\u201d Trump, however, gave the game an incestual twist, replying \u201cSex.\u201d \\nConsidering Donald J. Trump\u2019s record at subjecting Ivanka to his perversion, this shouldn\u2019t even be surprising, but it is absolutely disgusting. It is shocking and just plain gross. In 2006, Trump allowed Howard Stern the go-ahead to call Ivanka a \u201c piece of ass ,\u201d and agreed with this assessment (no pun intended) of his daughter. \\nThat same year he went on \u201c The View ,\u201d telling the ladies that he wouldn\u2019t disparage he posing for \u201cPlayboy\u201d and that if she wasn\u2019t his daughter he would be dating her. In 2003, he appeared with buddy Howard Stern, bragging about how his daughter\u2019s has the \u201c best body ,\u201d saying: \u201cYou know who\u2019s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She\u2019s 6 feet tall, she\u2019s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model\u2014a tremendous amount.\u201d \\nTrump\u2019s lack of discretion when referring to Ivanka is very, very weird and further proves that Trump is only capable of putting the women he interacts with into two camps: those he would have sex with and those he wouldn\u2019t. That Ivanka is his daughter does not change this. She is a woman he would have sex with, and nothing more. He pitifully can\u2019t even name anything they have in common. All that comes to mind is, as admitted by him, is sex. \\nMaybe Republicans should spend their time investigating Trump possibly molesting members of his own family instead of trying to needlessly take down Clinton, before her term (inevitably) starts. \\nWatch it here:'"}, "time": 1742562807.0702817}
