( source )   As you will see from the information below, it\u2019s not a big leap, which is why so many other scientists around the world support the extraterrestrial hypotheses. It\u2019s also important to note that this article is not implying that Carl Saga is a \u2018bad\u2019 person. If this information is indeed true, we still do not know the circumstances and details of it. It is a common occurrence for \u2018UFO\u2019s to be tracked on military radar , and more and more people are starting to believe that these objects are of extraterrestrial origin. and there is a good amount of evidence to believe that. One reason for this is the disclosure of evidence supporting such a hypothesis in recent years. If you want to see a fraction of that evidence, you can check out this article or the one pertaining to military radar linked above, or you can visit the exopolitics section of our website, here . If you really want to go in depth and read some proper studies on this topic, you can check out Richard Dolan\u2019s books . They are a great place to start, he is a brilliant academic and one of the world\u2019s leading researchers on the topic of UFOs. Sagan\u2019s Close Colleague Apart from the congressional hearings on this subject, and the fairly recent citizens hearing that took place, along with the release of official documentation, there has been a surge in people believing that ETs are real because of the work of scholars like Dr. Brian O\u2019Leary. Brian was a close colleague of Carl Sagan, who recruited him to teach at Cornell University in the late 1960\u2019s, where he researched and lectured in the department of astronomy and physics. After Cornell, he taught physics, astronomy, and science policy assessment at various academic institutions, including the University of California Berkeley, Hampshire College, and finally at Princeton University from 1976 to 1981. After this he went on to Washington, where he would become an advisor to various political leaders, presidential candidates, and the United States Congress.   Before all of this, Dr. O\u2019Leary was a NASA astronaut and a member of the sixth group of astronauts selected by NASA in August of 1967. One year after that, as mentioned above, Sagan recruited him to teach at Cornell. O\u2019Leary was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as secretary of the American Geophysical Union\u2019s Planetology Section. Furthermore, he was the team leader of the Asteroidal Resources Group for NASA\u2019s Ames Summer Study on Space Settlements. He was a founding board member of the International Association for New Science as well as founding president of the New Energy Movement. \u201cCarl Sagan called me from Cornell and asked me to join the faculty. I accepted the offer and spent many years at Cornell in the astronomy department, planetary science department. And I became very creative in research then, but still within the bounds of western science, but in the planetary exploration program. That was for a period of about a decade.\u201d ( source )( source ) As you can see, his resume is more than extensive, and O\u2019Leary is just one out of hundreds of people with this type of distinguished background to blow the lid on the extraterrestrial phenomenon. I use his video below in a lot of my extraterrestrial/UFO related articles, and I apologize to our regular readers, but I feel it\u2019s always useful to share with readers who have yet to come across it. The clip is taken from the Thrive documentary which, if you haven\u2019t seen yet, I highly recommend. You can read his entire biography \u2014 though I\u2019ll warn you it is quite large \u2014 HERE . Above I\u2019ve provided only the highlights of his impressive career. Brian passed away shortly after this video was taken. Apparently it happened shortly after having a heart attack and a diagnosis of intestinal cancer. What He Said Carl Sagan Did He had some interesting things to say during a live interview with Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot (view full live interview here , read transcript of video here ). O\u2019Leary and Sagan were close for a number of years, but had a little bit of a falling out when O\u2019Leary decided to leave Cornell. In the interview, he remarked: It was\u2026 One very cold snowy day in May, I landed in Syracuse, and there was a horizontal blizzard \u2014 in May \u2014 and I said: That\u2019s it for upstate New York . And Carl thought that was very frivolous. Because, of course, he was kind of an empire-builder kind of guy; and he also had a huge ego. After he left, O\u2019Leary started to examine some of Carl\u2019s work. He said that the famous \u201cFace\u201d in Cydonia on Mars \u2014 photographed by Viking in 1975, this enormous formation (about a mile across) resembled a human face and created a major buzz at the time \u2014 was tampered with by Sagan before being released to the public: It was very, very disappointing to me, because not only was Carl wrong, he also fudged data. He published a picture of the \u201cFace\u201d in Parade Magazine , a popular article, saying that the \u201cFace\u201d was just a natural formation, but he doctored the picture to make it not look like a face. At this time, Sagan and O\u2019Leary were arguably the world\u2019s two leading experts on Mars, and they entered into many disagreements over that face. This rift was made clear in O\u2019Leary\u2019s publication in 1998, \u201cCarl Sagan & I: On Opposite Sides of Mars.\u201d It can be found in The Case for the Face: Scientists Examine the Evidence for Alien Artifacts on Mars , eds. Stanley V. McDaniel and Monica Rix Paxson. Kempton, IL: Adventures Unlimited Press. In May of 1990, O\u2019Leary released a paper titled \u201c Analysis of Images of the Face on Mars and Possible Intelligent Origin \u201d which only further demonstrated his skepticism. It was published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Vol.43 No.5. O\u2019Leary also went on the record and stated: I began to realize, just directly from the scientific point of view, not only hearsay, that this man was colluding with NASA, that there might be more to this than before. . . . Carl was on a committee with a number of notable people. There was a report issued by the Brookings Institution in 1961 \u2014 and that\u2019s about when I knew Carl, during those years; the \u201960s mostly was when I worked closely with him \u2014 that he and this other group said: Well, if any ETs ever showed up on the Earth, it has to be covered up. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to be able to manage this, because if we can\u2019t, then it would be too much of a culture shock. Quite a shocking statement from someone of Brian\u2019s stature, isn\u2019t it? In the interview, he goes on to say that Carl and his colleagues recommended that the governments cover up the UFO phenomenon, and that he believes this provided justification for the ongoing cover-up It\u2019s important to note that this does not make Sagan a \u2018bad guy.\u2019 He was clearly the opposite of that, and his love for science and educating humanity was quite clear. If he was in favour of covering this up, if he did know about it, there is a very good chance it was done for what they perceived to be, good reasons. Sure, there might be some corporate reasons, and some other not so pleasant reasons the cover-up remains today, but it\u2019s plausible to assume that in the beginning, perhaps there was no I\u2019ll intent. \u201cBehind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.\u201d Former head of CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, 1960 (source) Why It\u2019s Time To Listen To Contactees, Abductees & Experiences/ A Psychological Standpoint Just to clarify, \u2018contactees\u2019 are usually those who have reported \u2018friendly\u2019 contact experiences with extraterrestrials, \u2018abductees\u2019 are those who have had what they perceive to be fearful experiences, and experiencers are those who neither view the experience as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad,\u201d but simply just an experience. It\u2019s important to note this, because various people have reported different types of experiences with different types of beings. \u201cYes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered\u2026 We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Edgar Mitchell, ScD, 6th man to walk on the Moon ( source ) ( source ) The reality is that some people who claim to have had contact with intelligent extraterrestrial beings actually have. John Mack, A Harvard professor, psychiatrist and Pulitzer Price recipient stresses that: \u201cYes, it\u2019s both. It\u2019s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it\u2019s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.\u201d ( source ) We published an article earlier this year regarding John Mack, and more than 60 school children witnessing non-human beings and a large craft landing. The children were interviewed by him, and it was quite a remarkable story with all of the children providing very similiar stories. Until this day these children have been speaking of it, an event occurred more than 20 years ago\u2026. \u201cThey describe these events like a person talks about something that has happened to them. I can tell that these are people of sound mind telling me something\u2026\u201d (quote continued and taken from the video linked below) -Dr. John Mack, professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School You can watch THIS video of Mack Interview the children, and you can read THIS article that goes more into detail on that case. According to retired McGill University professor in the Department of Psychology (research areas beings cognition and cognitive Neuroscience), Dr. Don Donderi: \u201cSome of what people report as UFOs are extraterrestrial (ET) vehicles. Some of those extraterrestrial vehicles actually have ET crews, and some of those ET crews catch and release humans.\u201d ( source ) Academicians like these, and others like Richard Dolan , David M. Jacobs and more have been studying this phenomena for decades, and the reports of beings and examining why they are here, what they are doing, what they look like and more has been documented by their (and others) research. What I find most fascinating about these stories is how many of them seem to compliment each other instead of contradicting each other, which just adds to the mystery. As far as physical research goes: \u201cThere are a great many photographs of such body marks, many of which are in an equilateral triangle pattern of red dots on the wrist or near the ankle. Also common are scoop marks,\u201d in which it appears as if a small amount of tissue was removed from beneath the skin, leaving an indentation.\u201d -Richard Dolan (taken from his book, UFOs for the 21st century mind ) Below is a clip of Dr. Roger Leir. a doctor of podiatric medicine, and arguably the best known individual with regards to extracting alleged alien implants. He has performed more than fifteen surgeries that removed sixteen separate distinct objects. These objects have been investigated by several prestigious laboratories, including Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, and many others. Unfortunately, he passed away in March 2014, but his legacy lives on. \\nTruth is, as former NASA astronaut and Princeton Physics Professor puts it, \u201cthere is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been visiting us for a vary long time.\u201d ( source ) Interesting Quotes About The UFO Phenomenon (A Few Out Of Many) ***Please keep in mind, the documentation regarding this phenomenon can be found from links that were mentioned in the very first paragraph of this article \u201d Everything is in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain, as well as the rest of the world.

Who they are, where they are from, and what they want should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not be the subject of \u2018rubishing\u2019 by tabloid newspapers.\u201d ( source ) \u2013 Lord Admiral Hill-Norton, Former Chief of Defence Staff, 5 Star Admiral of the Royal Navy, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee \u201cThere is another way whether it\u2019s wormholes or warping space, there\u2019s got to be a way to generate energy so that you can pull it out of the vacuum, and the fact that they\u2019re here shows us that they found a way.\u201d ( source ) \u2013 Jack Kasher, Ph.D, Professor Emeritus of physics, University of Nebraska. \u201cThis thing has gotten so highly-classified\u2026 it is just impossible to get anything on it. I have no idea who controls the flow of need-to-know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I\u2019ve never tried to make it to be my business since.
