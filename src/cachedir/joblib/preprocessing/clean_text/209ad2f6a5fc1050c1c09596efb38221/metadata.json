[Stelter appeared aghast after Carney suggested that there was no reason for reporters to \u201cpanic\u201d at the idea of a Donald Trump presidency.  Should Americans panic over @realDonaldTrump?

As an example, Carney pointed out that despite what cable news channels reported about Trump softening his position on immigration, he repeated his promise during his joint speech to Congress earlier in the week. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a real wall,\u201d Stelter protested. \u201cThis is what people say all the time,\u201d Carney replied. \u201cI believe there will be a real giant wall, and maybe it just got ten feet higher because he might have heard you say that. \u201d New York Times Washington Bureau Chief Elisabeth Bumiller boasted that they were increasing their staff of journalists in Washington D. C. to hold the administration accountable. \u201cI think it\u2019s extraordinary that the press sort of \u2018woke up\u2019 after Donald Trump\u2019s election to a moment of clarity about its job,\u201d Carney replied. \u201cI think that is one of the things that actually people find alienating. \u201d Carney suggested that Trump\u2019s worldview was fundamentally opposed to by many journalists who were tasked with covering the administration. \u201cThey can\u2019t hear the word or phrase \u2018economic nationalism\u2019 without thinking that is bad. They come from, I would say, a globalist secularist point of view and the idea of a president who uses the phrase \u2018America First\u2019 strikes them as disturbing,\u201d he said. Turning to the New York Times editor, Carney asked, \u201cDo you think you have enough people who understand and sympathize with Trump\u2019s worldview in your news organizations or do you think that you are predominantly staffed by people who view Trump\u2019s view as not just wrong but probably also evil?\u201d Bumiller shot back, \u201cDo you have enough people in your news organization who disagree with Trump\u2019s point of view?\u201d During the panel, Carney explained why he moved to Breitbart News from the Wall Street Journal. \u201cBreitbart is the most innovative and exciting source of journalism in America today,\u201d he replied, referring to the familiar \u201centrepreneurial spirit\u201d at Breitbart that he experienced when he helped create Business Insider.
