[The money will go from the pockets of Washington D. C.\u2019s taxpayers to the coffers of defense lawyers who are willing to represent the region\u2019s estimated 25, 000 illegal immigrants in court, the Washington Post reported.  Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said her city was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on their sanctuary city status, saying the illegal immigrant population would be supported by the \u201clegal community. \u201d \u201cWe must ensure that all District residents can take advantage of their federal and constitutional rights,\u201d Bowser told the Post. \u201cIf immigration enforcement changes and problems arise, D. C.\u2019s immigrant population will have our support and the support of D. C.\u2019s legal community. \u201d Washington is not the first in the country to begin a legal fund for migrants. Los Angeles, California, has started a much more significant fund, with nearly $10 million expected to be set aside to pay for the legal expenses of the area\u2019s massive illegal immigrant population, as Breitbart Texas reported.
