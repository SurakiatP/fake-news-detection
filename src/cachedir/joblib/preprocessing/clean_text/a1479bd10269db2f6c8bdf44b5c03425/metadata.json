Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. writing for the court, narrowed the definition of what sort of conduct can serve as the basis of a corruption prosecution. He said only formal and concrete government actions counted  \u2014   filing a lawsuit, say, or making an administrative determination. Routine political courtesies like arranging meetings or urging underlings to consider a matter, he added, generally do not, even when the people seeking those favors give the public officials gifts or money. That still leaves prosecutors plenty of room to pursue classic bribery and kickbacks. But there was widespread agreement among prosecutors and defense lawyers on Monday that the decision would make it harder for the government to prove corruption. The alternative to the new limits, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, would be to criminalize routine political behavior. \u201cConscientious public officials arrange meetings for constituents, contact other officials on their behalf and include them in events all the time,\u201d he wrote. The Supreme Court returned Mr. McDonnell\u2019s case to an appeals court for an assessment of whether prosecutors had presented evidence to satisfy the narrow definition of corruption announced Monday. If so, prosecutors may seek to retry Mr. McDonnell, but under the stricter standard. In a statement, Mr. McDonnell said that he was innocent and that he expected to be vindicated. \u201cI have not, and would not, betray the sacred trust the people of Virginia bestowed upon me during 22 years in elected office,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cIt is my hope that this matter will soon be over and that my family and I can begin to rebuild our lives. \u201d An appeal by his wife, Maureen, who was also convicted in the case, was put on hold while the court heard his case. Her conviction is likely to be thrown out now. Mr. McDonnell, a Republican who served from 2010 to 2014, was charged with using his office to help Jonnie R. Williams Sr. who had provided the McDonnells with luxury products, loans and vacations worth more than $175, 000 when Mr. McDonnell was governor. The gifts themselves were legal, and the question in the case was whether they were part of a corrupt bargain in which Mr. McDonnell reciprocated by using his office to help Mr. Williams. Mr. McDonnell arranged meetings for and attended events with his benefactor. But Mr. Williams, whose company made a diet supplement, did not have any real success in obtaining support from the state for his product. A jury found that Mr. McDonnell\u2019s actions amounted to corruption, and a federal appeals court upheld the conviction. Last year, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. McDonnell to stay out of prison while it considered whether to hear his case, McDonnell v. United States, No.  . That unusual order was a powerful hint that the court might rule in his favor. The hint proved right, though Chief Justice Roberts stopped well short of endorsing Mr. McDonnell\u2019s actions. \u201cThere is no doubt that this case is distasteful it may be worse than that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the government\u2019s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute. A more limited interpretation of the term \u2018official act\u2019 leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the statute and the precedent of this court. \u201d In their briefs to the Supreme Court, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s lawyers relied on the Citizens United decision in 2010, in which the Supreme Court said that \u201cingratiation and access\u201d were \u201cnot corruption. \u201d That year, the court ruled in favor of a former Enron executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, saying that a federal anticorruption law governing \u201chonest services\u201d applied only to bribes and kickbacks. Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s opinion did not address Citizens United or the First Amendment argument on which it was based. But he did say proof of something akin to bribery was required in corruption prosecutions. \u201cOf course,\u201d he added, \u201cthis is not to say that setting up a meeting, hosting an event or making a phone call is always an innocent act, or is irrelevant, in cases like this one. If an official sets up a meeting, hosts an event, or makes a phone call on a question or matter that is or could be pending before another official, that could serve as evidence of an agreement to take an official act. \u201d \u201cA jury could conclude, for example, that the official was attempting to pressure or advise another official on a pending matter,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \u201cAnd if the official agreed to exert that pressure or give that advice in exchange for a thing of value, that would be illegal. \u201d Mr. McDonnell\u2019s successor, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat who is facing a federal investigation involving campaign donations from a Chinese donor, issued a benign statement saying Mr. McDonnell and his family had \u201cremained in my thoughts and prayers,\u201d and noting that the former governor had \u201cmade mistakes and has apologized. \u201d He said he hoped the ruling would signal \u201cthe beginning of the end of this difficult process for our Commonwealth. \u201d But Anna Scholl, the executive director of Progress Virginia, a progressive advocacy group, said she was disappointed with the decision, \u201cwhich essentially gives elected officials a blank check to trade gifts for access and \u2018unofficial\u2019 favors. \u201d She said Mr. McDonnell \u201cdisgraced Virginia and the office he held, and Virginians should be outraged he has still not been held responsible. \u201d Mr. McDonnell had been a popular governor, but after his trial turned into the \u201ctawdry tale\u201d Chief Justice Roberts described, the public turned against him. Polls showed most Virginians thought he was guilty  \u2014   and the jury\u2019s decision reflected that, according to Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst in Richmond. \u201cMy sense was the jury\u2019s decision had almost nothing to do with the judge\u2019s instructions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury\u2019s decision was related to their revulsion at political figures being showered with gifts and loans on terms they couldn\u2019t possibly have for themselves. \u201d At the same time, officials in the state  \u2014   both Democrats and Republicans  \u2014   felt some sympathy for Mr. McDonnell because Virginia had no laws then barring what he did. (In 2015, after his conviction, lawmakers imposed a $100 limit on gifts from lobbyists.) Hundreds of people  \u2014   neighbors, friends, clergy and elected officials including Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat  \u2014   wrote letters to the judge who sentenced Mr. McDonnell, asking for mercy. \u201cThe McDonnell case was like a lightning bolt to the political class,\u201d Mr. Holsworth said. \u201cA lot of legislators were thinking, \u2018My goodness, there but for the grace of God go I. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562192.8547735}
