[Prosecutors rejected an appeal from an Austrian Muslim association to prosecute the populist politician for incitement after he made a strong   speech in Vienna in 2015. The Dutch prosecutors said the content of Mr. Wilders\u2019 speech was not punishable by Dutch law and that they will not pursue the matter any further, NU. nl reports.  Wilders was invited by the   migration Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) in 2015 to give a speech on Islamisation at the Hofburg palace. During the speech, Wilders said: \u201cIslam calls on people to become terrorists  \u2014   the Quran leaves no doubt about it. \u201d He also stated: \u201cIslam is an ideology of war and hatred. \u201d Wilders wrote a reply to the allegations saying that the charges were a \u201clegal jihad\u201d and \u201cwhile the elites are to blame for the existential crisis we are currently in, with their open   and unprecedented love for Islam and their cultural relativism, they sell us out completely and put our freedom and security at stake. \u201d The Dutch prosecutor explained their decision saying: \u201cOnly if a statement focuses on a group characterised by a belief may be punishable. \u201d \u201cWilders spoke on this occasion about Islam, not about Muslims, a group characterised by their Islamic faith. This falls under criticism in Dutch law and is not as insulting a group of people. \u201d Wilders reacted to the decision on Twitter writing: \u201cBeautiful. The only right decision. The truth must be said and can be correct about Islam!\u201d Mooi. De enige juiste beslissing. De waarheid moet gezegd kunnen worden, juist over de islam! https:  .   \u2014   Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) June 7, 2017,  The attempt to have Wilders brought to court for hate speech charges is not the first time the Party for Freedom (PVV) leader has been charged with incitement. Earlier this year, he was found guilty and fined 5, 000 euros for a speech he made in 2011 talking about the crime rates of Morrocan migrants in the Netherlands. Wilders\u2019 PVV made substantial gains in the Dutch national elections earlier this year becoming the second largest party in the country. As the coalition talks stall, Wilders has said the PVV is \u201cfully available\u201d to take part in a new coalition government. Current Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has consistently said that he would not work with the PVV, as have other parties. If coalition talks continue to break down, the Netherlands could face the option of calling another election.'"}, "time": 1742628552.6239493}
