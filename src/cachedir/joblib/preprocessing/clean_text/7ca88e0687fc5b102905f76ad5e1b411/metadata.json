Let\u2019s turn it over to Jonah Engel Bromwich for today\u2019s introduction. A California law that went into effect on Sunday barring drivers from holding phones while operating vehicles is among the most stringent in the nation. But experts say that it most likely won\u2019t be enough to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving. Jennifer Ryan, AAA\u2019s director of state relations, cautioned in a phone interview on Thursday that, \u201chands free is not risk free. \u201d Ms. Ryan said the California measure matched a larger trend of states bringing legislation    with contemporary phones. But while the state\u2019s provisions were particularly broad, she said, it was important for motorists to take responsibility for themselves and pay attention. The law goes beyond what federal authorities recommend to prevent distracted driving, which remains a significant cause of traffic fatalities. The latest statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that more than 3, 400 people died in 2015 in crashes that involved a distracted driver. Of those, 272 were teenagers. And while the use of smartphones is certainly part of the problem, many are unconvinced that keeping them out of drivers\u2019 hands will be a panacea. Some have speculated that the California law may encourage enthusiasm for   cars. When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure into law in September, he approved of another bill that allowed for the first tests of autonomous driving vehicles on public roads. Steve Finnegan, the government affairs manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California, said that while the new legislation \u201cis a step in the right direction,\u201d it does not address \u201cthe complete issue of distracted driving. \u201d \u201cOne of the bigger issues is cognitive distraction,\u201d Mr. Finnegan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what your hands are doing it\u2019s what your brain is doing. \u201d (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have metered paywalls.) \u2022 Senator Dianne Feinstein will be at the center of the debate over   Donald J.

Sausalito, a tiny waterfront community just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, is an inspiring place. So it was, many summers ago, that Otis Redding stayed on a houseboat there and came up with the first idea for an American classic. It was this weekend in 1968 that Mr. Redding\u2019s \u201c(Sittin\u2019 on) the Dock of the Bay\u201d was released. In August 1967, the   soul singer had come to San Francisco to do a series of gigs at Basin Street West, a storied club at the time. According to Jonathan Gould, the author of a forthcoming biography of Mr. Redding, the rock promoter Bill Graham offered Mr. Redding the use of his houseboat up in Sausalito. While relaxing there with his guitar, he is thought to have sketched the lines: Later, the guitarist Steve Cropper helped to fill out the rest of the song and it was recorded in November. But Mr. Redding never heard the single. Just 18 days after the studio session, he died in a plane crash in Madison, Wis. on Dec. 10, 1967. He was 26. On Jan. 8, 1968, the \u201cDock of the Bay\u201d album was released. The single rose to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s pop chart and stayed there for four weeks. It was the biggest hit of Mr. Redding\u2019s career. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.
