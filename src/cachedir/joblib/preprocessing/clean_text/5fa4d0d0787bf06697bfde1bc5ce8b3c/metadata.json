In the last three weeks, no compulsion has so consumed his psyche, and his Twitter account, as the deeply held and shallowly sourced belief that President Barack Obama tapped his phones. So why can\u2019t he just let go? First, aides say that Mr. Trump, who often says, \u201cI\u2019m, like, a really smart person\u201d in public, is driven by a need to prove his legitimacy as president to the many critics who deem him an unworthy victor forever undercut by Hillary Clinton\u2019s    win in the popular vote. \u201cThe Russia investigation is being used by his political opponents to delegitimize his entire presidency and to delegitimize his agenda,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a longtime Trump political adviser who remains close with West Wing aides. \u201cHe will fight back, and he does it better than anybody in this White House. And that includes all those Republican National Committee guys he hired to defend him. \u201d Second, fighting back  \u2014   in this case, against Mr. Obama, the F. B. I. director and members of his own party who say his claim about phone taps is false  \u2014   is an important part of the president\u2019s  . The two most influential role models in Mr. Trump\u2019s youth were men who preached the twin philosophies of relentless   and the waging of total war against anyone perceived as a threat. Mr. Trump, according to one longtime adviser, is perpetually playing a soundtrack in his head consisting of advice from his father, Fred, a   real estate developer who laid the weight of the family\u2019s success on his son\u2019s shoulders. Mr. Trump\u2019s other mentor was the caustic and conniving   lawyer Roy Cohn, who counseled Mr. Trump never to give in or concede error. Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation on Mr. Obama and an F. B. I. investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election echoes his actions in New York decades ago, when he engaged in bitter personal battles with the mayor, Edward I. Koch, and the city fathers of Atlantic City. The battles were often to the detriment of Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate and gambling businesses, according to Tim O\u2019Brien, author of \u201cTrumpNation,\u201d a 2005 biography that documented his early years.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new here in his behavior,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. O\u2019Brien, now the executive editor of Bloomberg View. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing this kind of thing for the last 45 years. \u2019\u2019\u201d \u2019\u201cHe\u2019s deeply, deeply insecure about how he\u2019s perceived in the world, about whether or not he\u2019s competent and deserves what he\u2019s gotten,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s an unquenchable thirst for validation and love. That\u2019s why he can never stay quiet, even when it would be wise strategically or emotionally to hold back. \u201d During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump fixated on almost every slight, especially in the news media, and singled out reporters for criticism at his rallies. A day after he was sworn in as the 45th president, he woke up furious that websites were running    pictures showing that his inaugural crowd was demonstrably smaller than Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 throng. He instructed his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to convene the press in the White House for a   over \u201cbiased\u201d reporting on crowd size, which delighted the new president but struck nearly everyone else as a bizarre overreaction. Mr. Trump\u2019s   Twitter message on March 4 amounted to a   declaration that he would be no one\u2019s victim. \u201cHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process,\u201d the president wrote in an unspellchecked outburst, one of several that morning. \u201cThis is  . Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d Toughness, more than any other attribute, is what Mr. Trump has sought to project during his short and successful political career  \u2014   and he believes his behavior makes him look tougher, no matter what the press thinks. As a presidential candidate, he wanted to look dour, and vetoed any campaign imagery that so much as hinted at weakness, aides said. Which is why every   snapshot  \u2014   down to the   scowl attached to his Twitter account  \u2014   features a   sourpuss. \u201cLike Churchill,\u201d is what Mr. Trump would tell staffers when asked what look he was going for. Third, diversion is an important motive. Mr. Trump was able to change the subject by attacking Mr. Obama and floating unsubstantiated theories. At the time of his   tweetstorm, he was trying to divert attention from a fresh embarrassment: Attorney General Jeff Sessions had failed to disclose, during confirmation hearings, that he had had contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States. \u201cWith almost every barbed, unscripted tweet, he deletes some story his administration wants to tell,\u201d said David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s top advisers. \u201cHe reacts to every affront, real or imagined, in Pavlovian fashion. He beats every perceived slight to death and, even when he\u2019s won the point, continues beating. \u201d Finally, Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t let up because no one can stop him. Within the White House, aides describe a nearly paralytic inability to tell Mr. Trump that he has erred or gone too far on Twitter. On the day Mr. Trump fired off his message about Mr. Obama \u201ctapping\u201d his phones, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus  \u2014   initially seen by some establishment Republicans as the best bulwark against Mr. Trump\u2019s   behavior  \u2014   told people the White House was convinced that there was something there. The problem is that the two advisers who aren\u2019t related to him but are powerful enough to try to change Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior are mostly disinclined to do so. His chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, a rhetorical bomb thrower himself, counseled Mr. Trump to moderate his behavior at the end of the campaign  \u2014   but he remains the West Wing adviser who most closely shares the president\u2019s views on surveillance. One of the only other people whom Mr. Trump views as a peer is his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, but he prefers to spend his capital on economic issues and climate change. In a recent meeting in the Oval Office, Mr. Cohn was speaking when Mr. Trump interrupted him. \u201cLet me finish,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cohn interjected, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction. Mr. Trump, unaccustomed to ceding the floor, let him make his point.'"}, "time": 1742628407.3283036}
