Trump for president, two months after Mr. Cruz pointedly declined to endorse his former rival in a speech at the Republican National Convention. \u201cAfter many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Cruz wrote in a statement on Facebook. For Mr. Cruz, who has fashioned himself as the unbending conscience of modern conservatism, the decision to endorse Mr. Trump is the latest remarkable gamble in a career defined by them, placing him in the corner of an ideologically elastic candidate who savaged Mr. Cruz  \u2014   and, often, the senator\u2019s family  \u2014   at every turn during the nominating contest. But Mr. Trump\u2019s rise in the polls, combined with a handful of political overtures from Mr. Trump and his team in recent days, left Mr. Cruz effectively boxed in, raising the possibility that a narrow Trump defeat could be laid at his feet. In his statement, Mr. Cruz said he had based his decision on two factors: a prior pledge to support the Republican nominee  \u2014   which Mr. Cruz said in July had been \u201cabrogated\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attacks on him  \u2014   and his desire to defeat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. \u201cIf Clinton wins, we know  \u2014   with 100 percent certainty  \u2014   that she would deliver on her   promises, with devastating results for our country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cMy conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop that. \u201d But Mr. Cruz\u2019s statement went beyond the perfunctory, praising the policy aims and recent campaign promises of a man he once called a \u201cpathological liar. \u201d Mr. Cruz did not address the personal attacks that Mr. Trump had leveled  \u2014   always without hesitation, often without evidence  \u2014   against the Texas senator and his family during the nominating fight. Among other slights, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility for the presidency, citing his birth in Canada seemed to disparage the appearance of Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, in a Twitter post and insinuated that Mr. Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Then there was the   nickname: \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted. \u201d In recent weeks, several former aides and allies to Mr. Cruz had urged him not to publicly back Mr. Trump, on both principled and pragmatic grounds. Such support could be seen as jeopardizing Mr. Cruz\u2019s professed reputation for conservative ideological purity, given Mr. Trump\u2019s   political views, which Mr. Cruz delighted in highlighting during his presidential campaign. And by voicing his support so late in the campaign, the senator also risks feeding a perception, rampant among Senate colleagues, that he is a cynical political operator, mindful only of his own interests. At his convention speech in July, Mr. Cruz urged Republicans to \u201cvote your conscience,\u201d leaving the stage in Cleveland to cascading boos. The next morning, as delegates from his home state jeered him at a breakfast, Mr. Cruz said he refused to fall in line like a \u201cservile puppy dog. \u201d Mr. Trump, for his part, said this summer that he would not accept Mr. Cruz\u2019s endorsement anyway. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cgreatly honored\u201d to have the backing of a \u201ctough and brilliant opponent. \u201d As news of Mr. Cruz\u2019s plans surfaced, first on Politico, some Cruz allies wasted no time registering their displeasure. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get this Cruz sticker off my car,\u201d Rick Tyler, the senator\u2019s campaign spokesman, said shortly after the endorsement was announced. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to get the wrong idea and think I\u2019m a Trump supporter. \u201d Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative radio host who had supported Mr. Cruz, called the senator\u2019s decision \u201cthe worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. \u201d Voters\u2019 responses were often no kinder. \u201cI am ashamed to have supported you,\u201d one man wrote. \u201cConservatism is dead,\u201d said another. While Mr. Cruz is widely expected to pursue the presidency again, he faces a 2018 Senate   campaign first. In recent days, signs of a tentative peace between the Cruz and Trump camps had begun to surface. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign issued a news release that was supportive of Mr. Cruz\u2019s latest Senate venture: his opposition to the federal government\u2019s plan to end its oversight of the internet\u2019s master directory of website addresses. Mr. Trump also included a close Cruz ally, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, on a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, which Mr. Cruz praised in his statement. Mr. Trump also now employs some members of the Cruz orbit: Jason Miller, who was a top adviser to the senator\u2019s campaign, and Kellyanne Conway, who ran a   \u201csuper PAC\u201d before becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cHell froze over today,\u201d Ms. Conway wrote on Twitter after the endorsement, \u201cand it feels like heaven. \u201d Longtime Cruz supporters could be forgiven for experiencing whiplash. On Friday, Mr. Cruz cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to nominate justices \u201cin the mold\u201d of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. In the primaries, he regularly disparaged Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment on judicial matters, holding forth on a \u201cradical   extremist\u201d federal judge who happens to be Mr. Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. On Friday, Mr. Cruz named Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy as a bright spot. In the primaries, he attacked Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals as \u201camnesty. \u201d On Friday, Mr. Cruz cited \u201cnational security\u201d as a reason to to back Mr. Trump. In the primaries, the senator described Mr. Trump as so unsteady that he might even use nuclear weapons against a friendly country like Denmark on a whim. Though Mr. Cruz spoke warmly of Mr. Trump early in the primary season, telling donors he planned to \u201cbearhug\u201d him in the hopes of winning his supporters if Mr. Trump faded, he let fly a blistering critique of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and political integrity just before leaving the race. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something I haven\u2019t done for the entire campaign,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters in Evansville, Ind. hours before decisively losing the state\u2019s primary in May. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump. \u201d He went on to call Mr. Trump \u201ca pathological liar\u201d \u201cutterly amoral\u201d \u201ca serial philanderer\u201d and \u201ca narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country has ever seen. \u201d If voters did not stop him, Mr. Cruz said, \u201cthis country could well plunge into the abyss. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628578.5792592}
