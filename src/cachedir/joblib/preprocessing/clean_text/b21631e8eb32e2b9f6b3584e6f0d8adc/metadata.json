[According to numerous reports, the suspected London Bridge terrorist appeared in a Channel 4 documentary last year, which also featured the \u201cnew Jihadi John\u201d alleged Islamic State executioner Abu Rumaysah, hate preacher Mohammed Shamsuddin (also know as Abu Saalihah) and infamous social media radical Abu Haleema.  Twelve people, including four women in niqabs and men in Islamic robes, were arrested in Barking yesterday after raids at a flat believed to be the home of one of the attackers. A    man has been released without charge. The    suspected terrorist is known as \u201cAbz\u201d in the film. According to The Times, one of the suspects was born in Pakistan, grew up in Britain, and has been named by relatives as one of three men who rampaged through the capital this Saturday. He is thought to be the attacker who wore an Arsenal shirt and was later pictured dying on the street with a fake suicide belt strapped to him. According to an associate, interview anonymously on the BBC\u2019s Asian Network, he was reported to the   hotline numerous times. It was also claimed that, two years earlier, police were warned that the suspect was trying to radicalise children in a local park. Police have asked the press not to fully identify the terrorists at this stage, but say they know who they are and will release their names \u201cas soon as operationally possible\u201d. Mohammed Shamsuddin, who \u201cAbz\u201d is filmed alongside in the Channel 4 documentary, was an associate of notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who founded the   terror group  . Mr. Choudary has been linked to numerous murderous terrorists, including Michael Adebolajo, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby, and the   London bombers, and was convicted last year of supporting Islamic State. Abu Haleema and suspected Islamic State executioner Abu Rumaysah were also associates of Mr. Choudary, and both appear in the same film \u201cAbz\u201d. In the Channel 4 program, the suspected London attacker is shown in a scene when the group of radicals, led by Mohammed Shamsuddin, pray in a central London park and unfurl a black flag which is identified as that of the Islamic State. The group mock the police when they are questioned and tread a delicate line throughout the film, appearing to praise Islamic State, a banned group, but not openly backing them. Islamic State has now claimed the London Bridge attack. At one point near the Channel 4 film, Mohammed Shamsuddin laughs and smiles as he watches Islamic State execution videos. \u201cThe guy\u2019s foaming at the mouth, wow!\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m eating, hahahaha. \u201d Abu Haleema, who has associated with Islamic State recruiters, says: \u201cfor the record, I don\u2019t support the Islamic State\u201d when challenged, before bursting out into a fit or laughter. \u201cJust for the record so I don\u2019t get nicked [arrested]\u201d he adds.'"}, "time": 1742562771.6236613}
