The nonprofit warned that if current trends continue, the world could lose more than two-thirds of wildlife by 2020.\\n\u201cAs humanity continues to demand more and more of the earth and puts pressures on our natural capital, what we\u2019re seeing is the fraying of wildlife,\u201d said Colby Loucks , senior director for the WWF\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Program. \\nHumans have affected the entire spectrum of vertebrate life ? fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, the report says. The document\u2019s warning of vanishing wildlife refers to total population size, not the number of species that will go extinct. That\u2019s an entirely different problem .\\n\\nLoucks linked wildlife losses to what he called the \u201cfive horseman\u201d of the environmental apocalypse: habitat loss, over exploitation, pollution, invasive species and climate change. Those factors have undercut the 3,706 species documented by the WWF on land and in ocean and freshwater habitats.\\nFreshwater species have been hit hardest, with populations declining 81 percent, according to the report. The freshwater biome covers less than a 0.01 percent of the planet\u2019s surface, but holds about 1 in 10 known wildlife species.\\n\u201cThere\u2019s less of the cuddly panda phenomenon going on there, because humans need water to survive, to grow crops,\u201d Loucks said, noting that \u201coftentimes we see freshwater for human use,\u201d and not for conservation. \\nWhy are there massive die offs of different species of animals around the world ? \\nHumanity has expanded so much ? clear-cutting rainforests , poaching big game , overfishing the seas ? that it now requires the equivalent of \u201c1.6 earths to provide the goods and services we use each year,\u201d the report says.\\nWWF ranks what it calls the \u201cecological footprint\u201d of this consumption ? basically the amount of resources a human lifestyle requires in a defined region. Rich nations, including the United States, Canada and Australia, have some of the biggest footprints in the world.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people really know the extent of these declines,\u201d Loucks said. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019re going to need collective action to try and maintain both humans and what we need, as well as the natural world.\u201d \\nFreshwater species have been hit hardest, with populations declining 81 percent, according to the report.

The first full census of African elephants found a 30 percent drop across the continent in just seven years. Wide swaths of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef have become a coral graveyard . Even the loneliest frog on Earth died , a symbol of \u201cthe extinction crisis.\u201d \\nThe WWF report says there\u2019s still time to stop mass extinction. Major worldwide initiatives to halt climate change and recent shifts toward renewable energy ensure we are not \u201cstarting from scratch,\u201d the report says.\\n\u201cThe facts and figures in this report tend to paint a challenging picture, yet there is still considerable room for optimism,\u201d the report reads. \u201cIf we manage to carry out critically needed transitions, the rewards will be immense.\u201d \\nChanges should include a revamped food system that balances human need with planetary capacity.\\n\u201cSustainability and resilience will be achieved much faster if the majority of the Earth\u2019s population understand the value and needs of our increasingly fragile Earth,\u201d the report says. \u201cA shared understanding of the link between humanity and nature could induce a profound change that will allow all life to thrive.\u201d \\nLoucks noted that such changes are \u201creally, really hard\u201d and mandate long-term thinking.\\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re going to start seeing impacts more locally, your favorite lake dries up or your favorite species is no longer there, maybe at that point you start thinking longer term,\u201d he said. \u201cE ach individual is going to have their threshold when they\u2019re going to start saying, \u2018Wow, I care.\u2019 \\n\\n\u201cBut at some point the earth is going to say \u2018enough.\u2019 And that\u2019s going to be catastrophic.\u201d written by Nick Visser Journalist/ Reporter, The Huffington Post \\nFollow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat: LukeWeAreChange \\nfbook: https://facebook.com/LukeWeAreChange \\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange I nstagram: http://instagram.com/lukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1$ a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too ! 12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT  \\nThe post In only 50 Years Humans Are Close To Killing Off Two-Thirds Of All Wildlife appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742564367.9012887}
