Instead, the cable news network has been buffeted by a whirlwind of speculation and the specter of a public relations debacle as serious doubts were raised about whether its   and chairman, Roger Ailes, would remain at the helm of the network. It started with a report by New York magazine on Monday saying that Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James  \u2014   the three men who sit atop Fox News\u2019s corporate parent, 21st Century Fox  \u2014   had come to the conclusion that \u201cAiles needs to go,\u201d after accusations of sexual harassment by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson. (Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit on July 6, after her contract was not renewed in June. Mr. Ailes has vehemently denied the accusations.) The article was followed 90 minutes later by a terse statement from the company: \u201cThis matter is not yet resolved and the review is not concluded. \u201d That chilly comment set off alarm bells at Fox News and in the television industry at large for what it did not say. The only previous public comment by 21st Century Fox took care to note that Mr. Ailes had its \u201cfull confidence\u201d and that he had \u201cserved the company brilliantly over the last two decades. \u201d And, roughly two weeks after Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit, interviews with people inside and outside the network  \u2014   none of whom would speak for attribution  \u2014   indicated a struggle within Fox News and 21st Century Fox over Mr. Ailes\u2019s fate, which now hinges on the findings of the law firm retained to investigate the accusations, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. In initial interviews with Fox News staff members, investigators for Paul, Weiss turned up disconcerting findings about the omnipotence of Mr. Ailes. Some people felt pressured to publicly support him in a climate that could intimidate others into silence, according to a person briefed on the early stages of the investigation. In addition, a campaign inside Fox News to rally support for Mr. Ailes included an   article from the Fox Business Network anchor Neil Cavuto in Business Insider, in which he vouched for Mr. Ailes\u2019s character and said that the accusations being made against him were \u201csick. \u201d Mr. Cavuto holds senior vice president and managing editor titles at Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, and his comments could be seen as chilling to anyone who was considering stepping forward with sensitive allegations. Mr. Cavuto, who wrote the article while recuperating from   surgery, said in an interview that the implication had not dawned on him. \u201cI had no Machiavellian motive or sinister intention,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only point was just to say this doesn\u2019t ring with the guy I know,\u201d he said, adding that he had worked with Mr. Ailes closely for decades. \u201cIt was so far from what I had seen  \u2014   as if I would ever condone that behavior. \u201d Several other Fox News Channel stars have come out in support of Mr. Ailes, including the anchors Greta Van Susteren, Harris Faulkner and Martha MacCallum. On Monday, Brit Hume, the longtime Fox anchor, speaking outside the Fox News production studios here, said, \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable to me that any conclusions could have been reached at this stage. \u201d Mr. Hume has spoken publicly in support of Mr. Ailes since the suit was first filed. The idea of Fox News without Mr. Ailes is difficult to fathom. As the network   his personality is ingrained in the network\u2019s brash approach to the news, which he has described as an antidote to a biased mainstream news media. That his future is now in doubt represents a fundamental change in his unassailable status at the top of the    network. Ms. Carlson, 50, filed her lawsuit on July 6, saying she was ousted from her weekday afternoon show on Fox News after rebuffing sexual advances from Mr. Ailes, 76, and complaining about harassment. Ms. Carlson accused Mr. Ailes of ogling her in his office and calling her \u201csexy. \u201d Her description of sexual harassment and retaliation was followed by accounts from other women who say Mr. Ailes acted inappropriately in professional settings between the   and the late 1980s. But in voicing support for Mr. Ailes, several of his defenders questioned Ms. Carlson\u2019s motives and wondered why she waited until her contract was not renewed to file a sexual harassment lawsuit. Mr. Ailes was unequivocal in his response on the day Ms. Carlson\u2019s lawsuit was filed. \u201cGretchen Carlson\u2019s allegations are false,\u201d he wrote in a statement. Fox News has been the No.   cable news station for 15 years, and represents about 20 percent of all profits for 21st Century Fox. Until now, it was widely assumed that Fox News\u2019s profitability would help ensure Mr. Ailes\u2019s position atop the network. Now the company has made it clear that what it calls the \u201cmatter\u201d involving Mr. Ailes is bigger than corporate earnings.'"}, "time": 1742561961.8968291}
