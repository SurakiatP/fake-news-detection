[In a statement sent to Forbes contributor Ollie Barder, Nintendo claims the Switch has \u201cno widespread technical problems\u201d and \u201call issues are being handled promptly. \u201d This specifically includes problems with the Bluetooth connection in the left   controller.  Nintendo said that the number of connection issues \u201cis not significant\u201d and that the \u201ctotal number of repair or replacement requests for Nintendo Switch, including for   is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen for any new hardware Nintendo has launched. \u201d The company also stressed that it was \u201ccommon with any new innovative consumer technology for consumers to have questions, and Nintendo Switch is no exception. \u201d They pointed to their online consumer support site for any questions related to the hardware, and \u201cencourage [customers] to contact Nintendo\u2019s Consumer Service team\u201d with any issues. While it\u2019s good to see Nintendo respond to consumer concerns, so far their statements are pretty par for the corporate course. Despite launch issues on multiple fronts, their focus is on keeping the perception of their brand strong in hopes of continuing the success they\u2019ve had so far with the new console\u2019s launch. The next months of the Switch\u2019s life will be pivotal, and the way Nintendo handles its customers\u2019 problems may very well define the ultimate success or failure of the company\u2019s hybrid console experiment.
