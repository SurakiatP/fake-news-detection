You bet there is, and it\u2019s being whipped up by the left and the Main Stream Media, here and around the world.  And it has a clear purpose: The ultimate goal is the destruction of the Trump presidency \u2014  and, for at least some, seemingly, the goal is the assassination of President Trump himself.   But don\u2019t take Virgil\u2019s word for it: Have a look at the cover of Village magazine.  That cover shows a rifle\u2019s crosshairs superimposed on a photograph of Trump\u2019s head.  And the headline reads, \u201cWhy not. \u201d  The   magazine, published in Ireland, is now basking in worldwide attention, and American social media are happy to magnify Village\u2019s glorification of a criminal act.  Here\u2019s that deadly image, for example, on Twitter.  As an aside, we might ask: Doesn\u2019t Twitter have rules against \u201chate speech\u201d and \u201cincitement of violence\u201d?  Or are they not enforced when the target is on the right? The Village article itself plays a clever editorial game.  It begins by describing Trump as \u201ca purveyor of hatred\u201d and then lists all his other purported sins, including the mistreatment of refugees, an overall   foreign policy, retrograde ideas on \u201cclimate change,\u201d and opposition to abortion.  After that litany, the magazine considers the options: \u201cSo perhaps the solution is tyrannicide.  As he might say himself \u2014  \u2018take him out. \u2019\u201d   Next, under the heading, \u201cKill Him?\u201d the magazine proceeds to cite philosophers and theologians who have declared tyrannicide to be justifiable, from Cicero to Thomas Aquinas to Martin Luther.  And then, to rub the point in even harder, the magazine admiringly recalls the German Klaus von Stauffenberg, who nearly succeeded in killing Hitler in 1944.  The message is obvious: Trump is another Hitler, and so you, the reader, must decide for yourself what to do next.  Yet then, having raised all these issues in the most    manner possible, the magazine pulls back, sort of, at the last moment. It writes, \u201cShooting Trump is unnecessary and disproportionate. \u201d  Of course, we all know what\u2019s going on here.  Indeed, Virgil recognizes the technique employed by Village as a variant on the ancient rhetorical device known as paralepsis \u2014  that is, raising an idea while pretending not to raise it.  Having argued, vehemently and at length, that Trump is a   menace, the magazine then adds a few   about not harming him.  So Village hopes that it has itself covered: If any bad fate befalls Trump, its writers will say, as they barely conceal their smirks, \u201cGee, we didn\u2019t want that to happen!\u201d  Indeed, even before the Village article, the idea of killing the 45th president was out there \u2014  bigtime.  Various  celebrities and rappers have wished death, if not murder, on Trump.  And Twitter seems to be a favored venue: The online publication Mashable reports in just the first 12 days of the Trump presidency, more than 12, 000 tweets have called for the President\u2019s assassination.  As the story notes, this volume of threats is far beyond the capacity of the US Secret Service to investigate. Meanwhile, the incendiary attacks keep coming.  Under the header, \u201cBeau Willimon Declares War On Donald Trump,\u201d Deadline: Hollywood details the strenuous efforts of the House of Cards creator to bring the President down.  The  article details Willimon\u2019s voluminous tweets, including his own   of the Declaration of Independence, which begins with the words: Perhaps one day, Twitter, and other social media, will get around to deleting these offensive, dangerous, and illegal posts.  Of course, perhaps one day, it will be too late.  Perhaps then, in the view of the   haters, it will be a case of the end justifying the means \u2014  \u201cmission: accomplished. \u201d  2.  The \u201cClimate of Violence\u201d \u2014  The Left Loves It So Much, So let\u2019s look more closely at this idea of a \u201cclimate of violence,\u201d which is said to foster acts of actual violence.  Sometimes this inflammatory \u201cclimate\u201d is real, and sometimes it is not real.  We\u2019ve learned that while the political left usually says that it opposes this sort of   \u201cclimatology,\u201d in fact, quite often, it embraces it \u2014  even adores it.  Yes, today, the left talks a lot about \u201cpeace,\u201d \u201ccoexistence,\u201d and all that.  And yet, as Virgil wrote in January, when it comes to Trump, one tool of the left, the MSM, gets notably militant it becomes hormonally eager to reach for violent imagery.    So it\u2019s in this context that we must evaluate extreme   media items, such as the   of Rosa Brooks, a former high official in the Obama administration, that what\u2019s needed is a military coup d\u2019etat against the Trump White House.  We can note that Brooks published this piece in a   MSM outlet, Foreign Policy, on January 30, and it\u2019s still there.  Nobody in the MSM, at least, seems to have a problem with it.   More recently, in the same   spirit, the German magazine Der Spiegel, arguably the most influential publication in that country, unveiled a cover story showing a   Trump holding high the bloodily decapitated head of Liberty, from the Statue of Liberty.  The message to readers is clear: We must stop this madman before it\u2019s too late.   We can note that the Spiegel cover was admiringly echoed all over the planet among the admirers was The Washington Post, which, sticking up for the American media, pointed out that The New York Daily News had presented a similar cover back in December 2015.  Meanwhile, as John Nolte has chronicled, CNN has been a serial offender: For more than a year now, it has hurled, against Trump, just about every loaded epithet imaginable.  And it\u2019s not just Trump.  It\u2019s also his staff that\u2019s in the crosshairs.  For instance, on February 5, USA Today published an editorial entitled, \u201cWhat Bannon shares with ISIL leader. \u201d  Yes, you read that right: A newspaper that claims a readership in the many millions just equated White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr  .  As the piece asserted brazenly, the two \u201cshare similar world views. \u201d   We might pause to note that this was an editorial, as opposed to a random opinion piece.  In other words, the words represent the collective judgment of the USA Today editorial board, whose names can be found here.  Yes, this is what they really think.  The sheer nuttiness of the editorial aside, we can observe that the piece is seemingly an open invitation to take, uh, strong action against Bannon.   So, yes, the left hates the \u201cclimate of violence\u201d \u2014  except when it loves it.   And there\u2019s a long history: Perhaps the most cynical use of the \u201cclimate\u201d trope has been the way that the left has twisted the cultural and historical memory of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.    That tragic incident, of course, occurred in Dallas then, and now, North Texas has been a conservative area.  And so for more than    it\u2019s been an MSM cliche \u2014  boosted by prominent historians, such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. \u2014  that a local \u201cclimate of hate\u201d was somehow responsible for JFK\u2019s death.  Even today, after it\u2019s been established beyond doubt that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was a   communist, the \u201cclimate of hate\u201d meme still persists in the MSM.  In other words, it\u2019s the fault of Dallas, and the right, that Kennedy was murdered.  Similarly, after the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the   immediately heaped the blame on \u201c  media. \u201d  And this drumbeat has continued, even after it was learned that the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was sexually obsessed with Giffords and was listening to nothing but the voices in his head.  More recently still, in 2016, we were reminded that the left never objects to a climate of violence \u2014  if it\u2019s for a \u201cgood cause. \u201d  Thanks to the efforts of James O\u2019Keefe and others, it\u2019s easy to find abundant,      evidence that the Clinton campaign, or at least its close allies, deliberately sent provocateurs to Trump rallies to cause trouble \u2014  trouble which then could then be blamed on Trump.  In the summarizing words of Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak: Clinton\u2019s defenders might claim she did not know anything about the tactics being used, but that defense does not suffice.  The consultants who carried out the tactic, centered around Robert Creamer and his Democracy Partners organization, told O\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover investigators that they had set up a \u201c \u201d system so that Clinton would not have to know directly about any particular action being taken on her behalf, but Creamer appeared to admit on video that Clinton had general knowledge about their activities. Needless to say, state and local authorities have been completely uninterested in pursuing any of these seemingly    cases of conspiracy and incitement.  And the beat goes on.  In DC on January 21, the   Madonna, speaking to a large crowd of angry feminist protesters, mused about \u201cblowing up the White House. \u201d  And she has continued to defend her remarks, which could reasonably be construed as incitement to violence, even murder.  (One can only imagine what would have happened if a conservative had said that.)  And yet of course, Madonna will face no economic or legal consequences indeed, Hollywood will probably find a way to give her some new award or endorsement gig.   In the meantime, out west, Milo Yiannopoulos has also been the object of a \u201cclimate of violence. \u201d  And yet for their part, pressies have oscillated between yawning and cheering.  A man was shot and critically wounded in Seattle, and still, the MSM didn\u2019t much care, because, after all, the man seems to have been a Milo supporter.  And just a few days ago, at the University of California\u2019s Berkeley campus, rioters shut down a Milo appearance.  As Milo said afterward, the rioting \u201ctells you something very, very clear about the left\u2019s commitment to free expression. \u201d   It\u2019s worth recalling that back in 1964, Berkeley was the hub of what was grandiosely dubbed, by students, as the \u201cFree Speech Movement. \u201d  Now, 53 years later, the   guardians of the First Amendment have had no interest in upholding Milo\u2019s constitutional right to free speech.  In fact, some on the left have gone the complete opposite way: toward   ideological  .  One such is UC Berkeley\u2019s Robert Reich, the former Clinton cabinet secretary Reich went on TV to accuse the right \u2014  and specifically, Breitbart \u2014  of causing the violence, as a provocation against the left.   In other words, the whole fracas was Milo\u2019s fault.  Talk about blaming the victim!  Reich\u2019s brand of fantastic projection was too much for Rush Limbaugh, who asked of his   audience:   Do you know any   capable of this kind of behavior?  I mean, go to Ferguson, go to Baltimore, go to San Bernardino, go to Watts.  Take any protest, any violence.  Go to Oakland any time you want.  Any time there is violent protests, it\u2019s always   bought and paid for by the Hillary campaign, the Democrat Party, or George Soros, and never once have the Democrats ever condemned them, \u2019cause they\u2019re proud of them. Yes, that is correct:   Democrats have never condemned the violent hooligans doing their dirty work, for one simple reason \u2014  they\u2019re proud of them.  And even now, Reich continues to unapologetically \u2014  make that, eagerly \u2014  spew his crackpot conspiratorializing.  Obviously Reich is a devotee of the Big Lie: that is, a falsehood, repeated often enough, equals truth.  So never mind the fact that we have since learned that it was the   protesters who were on someone\u2019s payroll \u2014  George Soros\u2019 payroll.  (We might also observe, not that any of the local authorities seem to have noticed, that the fomenting \u2014  and financing \u2014  of violence is a crime.) As Milo told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson, the left\u2019s game plan is to claim that its opponents are nothing but racists, sexists, white nationalists,   and homophobes.  And to make these charges, the left doesn\u2019t need any evidence, only the accusations.  Once again, that\u2019s the Big Lie technique.  And yet such   slandering is just fine with the MSM, which then goes to work amplifying the accusations, thus amping up, yes, the \u201cculture of violence. \u201d  As Milo said: The media has created this environment in which it\u2019s okay to say almost anything about somebody who is right of Jane Fonda.   \u2026     And it\u2019s a way of legitimizing, in some cases, as happened last night, violent responses. And we might add, beyond Milo, Breitbart itself is increasingly the target.  Virgil might add that the tactics being used are straight out of Saul Alinsky\u2019s Rules for Radicals.  All of Alinsky\u2019s \u201crules\u201d are being practiced today, but we can focus on Rule #11: \u201cPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. \u201d Breitbart is tough we\u2019re used to fights and fighting.  This wasn\u2019t a fight we began, but it is a fight we seek to win.  And yet everyone on the   right ought to see the current situation clearly: The hard left has plenty of resources, and no scruples about deploying those resources.  And so Breitbart is just one of many targets.  And of course, if the left can attack us, well, Soros  Co. won\u2019t stop there.  They\u2019ll be coming for you next.  So that\u2019s the real context of the vast \u201cclimate of violence\u201d conjured up by the left. It\u2019s all part of a master plan \u2014  a plan for mastery.  That is, smash the enemy, and then rearrange the pieces into a new   order.  Yet in the meantime, we must remember the main target: President Trump.  And so we can can step back and observe, with grim certainty, the dream scenario of some on the other side:  A weird and bloody kind of   glory awaits the person who takes to heart the message of that cover story in Village.'"}, "time": 1742562650.3395224}
