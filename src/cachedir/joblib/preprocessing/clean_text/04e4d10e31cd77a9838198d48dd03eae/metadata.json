[According to a report from the Brookings Institute, strangling the internet cost $2. 4 billion over the course of 2016. Senior Global Advocacy Manager Deji Olukotun of the Access Now digital rights organization believes that an even greater cost can be counted in human lives.  Olukotun says that the shutdowns \u201cgo hand in hand with atrocities,\u201d citing the deaths of Ethiopian protesters \u201cduring the kind of blackout where it\u2019s difficult to report on what\u2019s happening. \u201d Other shutdowns include communication blackouts during the Ugandan elections, and governments that chose to go so far as shutting down all Internet access just to keep students from cheating on exams. The biggest losses are clustered near the top, with three major contenders. Conservative estimates suggest that India lost nearly a billion dollars due to its shutdowns, while Saudi Arabia managed nearly half a billion on its own. Morocco gave up $320 million. Even governments that didn\u2019t wall off the entirety of the Internet still blocked access to social media in some cases, and their methods have steadily become more sophisticated. As time goes on, it grows more and more difficult for citizens to find any way around restrictions on digital information. Olukotun would like to see \u201ctelecommunications companies [push] back on government orders, or at least document them to show what\u2019s been happening, to at least have a paper trail. \u201d The UN\u2019s International Telecommunications Union could also discourage such measures by shining a light on the events as they happen. The good news is, \u201cmost governments want to expand internet access,\u201d so that they can \u201cparticipate in the global economy and be competitive. \u201d There have been as many or more investments in expanding access to the unlimited information made available by the Internet as there have been instances of censorship.
