In what may be the first clear sign that President Trump means to break with the policies of his predecessor, ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea, said in a statement \u201canyone in the United States illegally could be deported. \u201d Elzea\u2019s statement went on to say that while ICE \u201cfocuses its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security  \u2026    [Homeland Security] Secretary [John] Kelly has made clear, ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. \u201d There were 5, 441 arrests of   aliens, more than double the total from last year, according to Fox News\u2019 Adam Housley, who reported Monday that \u201cICE detainers \u2014  requests to local authorities to hold criminal aliens \u2014  are up 75 percent, to more than 22, 000. \u201d On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this past Sunday, Kelly made it clear that the definition of \u201ccriminal\u201d has not changed, \u201cbut where on the spectrum of criminality we operate has changed. \u201d In Housely\u2019s report, Kelly said ICE agents may move to deport an individual with multiple DUI offenses \u2014  even though in the past, those individuals would have been \u201cunlikely\u201d to be deported. \u201cThe law deports people. Secretary Kelly doesn\u2019t. ICE doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s the United States criminal justice system that deports people,\u201d Kelly said. Even though Trump\u2019s arrest and deportation statistics haven\u2019t surpassed Obama\u2019s according to The Week, \u201cIt\u2019s the tactics Trump\u2019s ICE agents use  \u2014   arresting [illegal] immigrants in state and local courthouses and on the way to work, as well as apparently targeting immigrant advocates who speak out  \u2014   that has struck terror into [illegal] immigrant communities. \u201d The threat of enforcement has reportedly resulted in fewer crimes being reported in some communities heavily populated by illegal aliens.  Whether or not that\u2019s because the threat of enforcement has led potential criminals to lay low \u2014  or potential victims from reporting crime \u2014  remains to be seen. It\u2019s worthy to note that almost every media source that covered this story made reference to how the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the 11 million illegal aliens in the US who are not felons, are \u201cotherwise  . \u201d  There are two problems with that narrative.  First, the 11 million number has been quoted by media sources since 2005 \u2014  even though a source is never quoted. The number could be substantially more.   author Ann Coulter suggest the number of illegal aliens in the United States could be as high as 30 million. Secondly, there are countless examples of ordinary illegal aliens, whose first crime resulted in the tragic murder of a person who would otherwise be alive \u2014  had the law been enforced and unlawful aliens removed.
