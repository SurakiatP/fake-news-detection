[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\\nAccording to this report, the practice of President Obama selling American government positions was first raised in 2013 by US diplomats who publically cried foul over this massive bribery scheme \u2014and that hacked emails and documents proved was widespread, including bribes to become everything form ambassadors to assistant attorneys in the Justice Department .\\nTo the largest known bribe to President Obama for a US government position though, this report continues, MoF banking regulators discovered in a Citibank Kazakhstan numbered (secret) account originally holding $20 million linked to the American leader by transfers made from it to his \u201cpersonal/private\u201d JPMorgan Chase account .\\nTo how this discovery was made, this report notes, was through a MoF banking examination of the Republic of Kazakhstan who is seeking to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) that the Federation is the third largest shareholder in after China and India .\\nDuring the MoF\u2019s examination of the Kazakhstan banking system on behalf of the AIIB, this report explains, a \u201cmysterious/suspicious\u201d numbered (secret) account (that originally held $20 million) was discovered at Citibank Kazakhstan in the name of a private American entity (not a non-profit) called the Haiti Development Fund LLC that was created by the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization and was solely funded by Canadian mining mogul Frank Giustra and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim with the money being \u201cchanneled/funneled\u201d through the Clinton-Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada).\\nFrank Giustra, this report explains, is one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s main supporters who, so far, has given her over $100 million as well allowing her to use of one of his private luxury jets , while Carlos Slim has, likewise, pledged to give her $100 million \u2014and who just months prior to Clinton announcing her run for the US presidency, in 2015, became the majority owner of the New York Times that throughout this American election cycle has turned this once internationally respected newspaper into nothing more than a Donald Trump \u201cdestruction machine\u201d with it even shockingly admitting \u201c that because Trump says things that are rude, politically incorrect, or debatable, and \u201cconducting his campaign in ways we\u2019ve not normally seen,\u201d there is no need for news reporters to treat him to objective reporting \u201d.\\nWith the Carlos Slim\u2019s New York Times being the beginning of the \u201c vast leftist echo chamber \u201d created to defeat Donald Trump, this report says, its nearly all untrue articles about him are able to be parroted by hundreds of other news sites while at the same time ignoring the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton\u2014and that due to Wikileaks the Clinton campaign has been forced to admit, including Hillary Clinton illegally accepting millions in bribes from radical Islamic countries , and a staggering internal Clinton Foundation document admitting that it is not a charity, but a \u201cpolitical operation\u201d that has broken the law .\\nEqually as stunning to the self admitting facts that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt, this report continues, has been Carlos Slim\u2019s New York Times keeping from the American people the shocking truth relating to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s pedophilia\u2014and as evidenced by his home being filled with paintings, photos and sculptures of naked teenager children, and that the Washington Post attempted to cover up , but whose original story about this abhorrent crime against children can still be viewed online .\\nAnd as if Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s pedophilia isn\u2019t enough to shock normal human senses, this report says, Carlos Slim\u2019s New York Times covering up his fascination with human cannibalism is equally as concerning as new Wikileaks documents have revealed his satanic occult relationship with it is called \u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d whose sickening rituals include the use of blood, semen and breast milk .\\nThough the MoF does note that the current war being waged by the FBI against Hillary Clinton ( and as we\u2019ve previously reported on ) is, indeed, justified , this report concludes, their leaking to the New York Post elements of a Federation investigation isn\u2019t\u2014and that led Prime Minister Medvedev earlier today to state that relations between Russia and the United States \u201c have now hit rock bottom \u201d.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628553.3725235}
