Her study found northern Europe could see 0.4 to 0.8 degrees of cooling if solar activity hits record low levels. \\n\u201cThis research shows that the regional impacts of a grand solar minimum are likely to be larger than the global effect, but it\u2019s still nowhere near big enough to override the expected global warming trend due to man-made change,\u201d Ineson said in a statement. \\n\u201cThis means that even if we were to see a return to levels of solar activity not seen since the Maunder Minimum, our winters would likely still be getting milder overall,\u201d she said. \\nBut sunspot aficionados argue the \u201cpause\u201d in global average temperature since the late 1990s coincides with decreasing solar activity. Most scientists say the \u201cpause\u201d in global warming was caused by ocean oscillation cycles. \\n\u201cSince 1990, the Sun has been in the declining phase of the quasi-bicentennial variation in total solar irradiance,\u201d Abdussamatov wrote. \u201cThe decrease in the portion of TSI absorbed by the Earth since 1990 has remained uncompensated by the Earth\u2019s long-wave radiation into space at the previous high level because of the thermal inertia of the world\u2019s oceans.\u201d \\nOriginal content provided by The Daily Caller ; additional commentary and insight provided by TRUNEWS Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?
