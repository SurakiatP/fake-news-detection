Wayne Hayes of Jasper, Indiana said: \u201cBoy, were we not ready for a woman president. Not this century. \u201cCommentators were all \u2018well we had a black man as president\u2019, but didn\u2019t reckon the most important word there was \u2018man\u2019. \u201cWomen can\u2019t be trusted. They\u2019re emotional, they think clothes are important, and might try to get revenge for the last 6,000 years. \u201cI believe President Trump should pass a constitutional amendment to make sure no woman embarrasses herself like this ever again.
