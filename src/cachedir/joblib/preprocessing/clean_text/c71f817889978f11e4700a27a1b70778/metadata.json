So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away.\u201d \\nBenton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel $2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter. \\nThe Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them \u2013 the Clinton campaign, the media, polling organizations \u2013 of \u201crigging\u201d the election against them. But time and time again it\u2019s been obvious that the Republican Party has been the one behind the scenes working to disenfranchis e the American voter \u2013 especially non-white, male voters . \\nSince the Republicans can\u2019t win this game, they have elected to change the rules instead, by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters \u2013 especially minorities \u2013 from exercising their right to vote, closing down polling stations. \\nThey justify this in an underhanded appeal to \u201cprotecting the integrity\u201d of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of \u201cvoter fraud\u201d over the nation\u2019s head. This is an entirely manufactured crisis that does not exist, but has been used to deprive thousands of potential Democratic voters of their rights. The Republican Party is an enemy of American democracy, and we must punish them for it at the ballot box. \\nWatch it here:'"}, "time": 1742561733.3103123}
