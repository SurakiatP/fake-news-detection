The Jewish Algemeiner writes that \u201cthe 500th anniversary of the Reformation would be the \u2018perfect time\u2019 for Protestant leaders to recognise and apologise for the \u2018horrific antisemitism\u2019 of their movement\u2019s founder, Martin Luther.\u201d \\nThe truth of the matter is that Martin Luther didn\u2019t know about Zionism, Israeli criminality, Alan Dershowitz, Bernie Madoff, Jeffrey Epstein, or Sir Philip Green but he still had a serious problem with the Jews. Back in 1543 he wrote On The Jews and their Lies , a book notorious for its opposition to Jews and their religion. \\nRabbi Abraham Cooper\u2014associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre\u2014wants the Protestants to disown the founding father of their church or at least to \u201cdirectly address the issue (of anti-Semitism) in the overall context of what they\u2019re celebrating in terms of this anniversary,\u201d \\nDavid Michaels of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith insists that the churches reject some of their founder\u2019s teachings. \u201cThis reality requires committed Lutherans and other Christians to ensure that there is fitting recognition and rejection of Luther\u2019s hateful beliefs about Jews, wherever these persist.\u201d \\nThe Protestant world is clearly being subjected to an institutionalized assault Judaism. But there is one thing the Jewish Algemeiner fails to do. It fails to brief us about Luther\u2019s argument against the Jews. The truth of the matter is that Luther\u2019s animus towards Jewry wasn\u2019t at all racially driven. His arguments against Jews were purely theological rather than biological. Thus, using the term \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 in reference to Luther is misleading. It leaves one wondering whether Bnai B\u2019rith and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are lying consciously when they refer to Luther as an \u2018anti-Semite\u2019? If they do, we may actually need to seek the assistance of Luther\u2019s book in order to grasp Rabbi Cooper and Michaels\u2019 conduct. \\nGilad Atzmon is an Israeli jazz musician, author and political activist.
