The defendant, C\u00e9dric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives. He would do it again, he suggested. Instead, when asked by a judge, \u201cWhy do you do all this?\u201d Mr. Herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of France\u2019s practice of rounding up and turning back Africans entering illegally from Italy in search of work and a better life. It was \u201cignoble,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people dying on the side of the road,\u201d Mr. Herrou replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. There are children who are not safe. It is enraging to see children, at 2 in the morning, completely dehydrated. \u201cI am a Frenchman,\u201d Mr. Herrou declared. The trial, which began on Wednesday, is no ordinary one. It has been substantially covered by the French news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of France\u2019s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into Europe and the quandary they present. France, foremost among European nations, prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism, fraternity and solidarity. And yet, perhaps first among them, too, it is struggling to reconcile those values with the pressing realities of a smaller, more globalized world, including fear of terrorism. The contradictions are being played out in courtrooms, in politics and in farmers\u2019 fields, on the sidewalks of Paris and in train stations from the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur to the northern port of Calais, where the government demolished a giant migrant camp in the fall. On the one hand, politicians in this year\u2019s presidential election are competing to see who can take the toughest line on securing France\u2019s borders. Most are promising a crackdown on migrants, with admission reserved for   cases of political persecution. Terrorist attacks, including the one last summer in Nice that killed 85 people, have exacerbated   sentiment. But in these remote mountain valleys, where Jews fleeing the Nazis and the Vichy collaborators found refuge during World War II, Mr. Herrou has become something of a folk hero by leading a kind of loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north, many destined for Britain or Germany. His work has won him admiration for his resistance to the state and his stand that it is simply right to help one\u2019s fellow man, woman or child. Others in this region seem to agree. In the square outside the   courthouse, hundreds of sympathizers gathered and shouted, \u201cWe are all children of immigrants!\u201d Mr. Herrou got a hero\u2019s welcome as he descended the steep steps late in the evening, trailed by television cameras. Inside, not even the prosecutor,   Pr\u00eatre, seemed to want him there and praised his cause as \u201cnoble. \u201d He asked for an   sentence, but quickly reassured the court that it should be suspended, \u201cof course. \u201d Still, the law is the law. \u201cHe\u2019s demonstrated a manifest intention to violate the law,\u201d Mr. Pr\u00eatre told the court. \u201cOne can criticize it, but it\u2019s got to be applied. \u201d The verdict, which will be made by the panel of three judges who heard the case this week  \u2014   there was no jury of peers  \u2014   is scheduled to be announced on Feb. 10. The appeal for leniency was both an acknowledgment of widespread discomfort with the law, as a well as recognition of Mr. Herrou\u2019s growing status in the region around Nice and its mountainous backcountry, the Roya Valley. Mr. Herrou was voted \u201cAzur\u00e9en of the Year\u201d last month by the readers of the leading local newspaper,   to the fury of regional officials. \u201cI am C\u00e9dric,\u201d read one of the placards in the crowd. \u201cLong live the righteous of the Roya,\u201d read another. The courtroom on Wednesday was filled with people from the mountain  \u2014   the men bearded and ponytailed, the women in duffel coats  \u2014   who had come to support Mr. Herrou and who were convinced right was on their side. The notion that Mr. Herrou is trying to uphold what he sees as basic French values, rather than violating the law, is much of the reason he appears to enjoy a considerable measure of popular support. The argument formed the essence of his lawyer\u2019s defense strategy. Remember the last word in the French Republic\u2019s motto, \u201cLibert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9,\u201d his lawyer, Zia Oloumi, told the court. \u201cThey are saying M. Herrou is endangering the Republic,\u201d Mr. Oloumi told the three judges. \u201cOn the contrary, I think he is defending its values. \u201cYou see, you have got this value, fraternity, and the dictionary is quite clear,\u201d Mr. Oloumi said. \u201cThink about the impact of your decision on the practical application of the idea of fraternity. \u201d Mr. Herrou was not making any political points, Mr. Oloumi insisted. He was merely responding to a humanitarian crisis in his own backyard the Roya Valley had become a way station for migrants. The judges did not respond. But the lightness of the sentence called for by Mr. Pr\u00eatre suggested that the concepts invoked by Mr. Oloumi had resonance. Mr. Herrou\u2019s accusers seemed most taken aback by his stubbornness. Not every migrant Mr. Herrou picks up is by the side of the road. He finds many outside the migrant camp across the Italian border at Ventimiglia, looking especially for women and children. The presiding judge, Laurie Duca, reminded him he had first been arrested in August, near his mountainside home at    with a van full of migrants. At that time, the prosecutor released him, suggesting that Mr. Herrou\u2019s humanitarian motivations absolved him. That first arrest was evidently merely a warning. \u201cAfter August, you said you knew it was illegal,\u201d Judge Duca remarked in court. No matter. Mr. Herrou persisted, describing his   work to journalists last fall and even occupying a disused summer camp owned by the state railroad when his own modest homestead became overwhelmed. At that point, in   the authorities decided they had had enough of him. \u201cYou were there, and you were extremely active,\u201d the judge said. \u201cWhy so much press?\u201d Mr. Herrou replied, \u201cIt is right that society should know about all this. \u201d The judge and the prosecutor suggested that this time Mr. Herrou would not get the humanitarian pass he had benefited from previously. The local political establishment is furious with him. \u201cAt the very moment when we need strict controls, Mr. Herrou\u2019s ideological, premeditated actions are a major risk,\u201d Eric Ciotti, the president of the departmental council and a leading   member of Parliament, wrote in  . Mr. Pr\u00eatre, the prosecutor, suggested that Mr. Herrou\u2019s persistence and openness had been his undoing. \u201cMr. Herrou acknowledges everything,\u201d Mr. Pr\u00eatre said, with astonishment. \u201cThis trial springs from a communications strategy for a cause that I totally respect. \u201d And yet, \u201cthis is what he told the police. He said, \u2018I am violating the law.\u2019 But I am the prosecutor. I must defend the law. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562104.9878898}
