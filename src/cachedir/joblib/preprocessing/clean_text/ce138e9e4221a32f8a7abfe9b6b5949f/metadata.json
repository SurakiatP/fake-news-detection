The nurses union also invested a lot of time and resources into get out the vote efforts and hosted a major People\u2019s Summit in June that brought all the forces, which were supportive of the Sanders campaign, together in Chicago to explore how to carry on a people\u2019s agenda after the election.\\nRoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of NNU, responded, \u201cThe Clinton team\u2019s attack on nurses as \u2018fringe\u2019 and not a \u2018real union\u2019 is deplorable, but hardly a shock. It\u2019s a window in how they seek to vilify any critics, as evidenced in other emails showing Clinton\u2019s mocking disdain for environmental activists.\u201d\\nDeMoro continued, \u201cApparently, a \u2018real union\u2019 is only one that falls lock step within the Democratic Party establishment and \u2018fringe\u2019 when it fails to embrace partnerships with Wall Street and other corporate interests.\u201d\\n\u201cSadly, it\u2019s also a preview of what we can expect in the next four years and a reminder that\u2014from day one of the Clinton administration\u2014NNU and our allies will need to make our voices loudly heard to advocate for social, economic, and political justice for patients and all people.\u201d\\nOn August 9, 2015, the labor outreach director, Nikki Budzinski, indicated NNU would endorse Sanders. It was the first national labor endorsement the campaign failed to win.\\nMook replied, \u201cOn the nurses\u2014can we be ready [with] background for the press team on how fringe they are? Also have they praised HRC before?\u201d\\n\u201cI would be wary of trying to attack them as fringe,\u201d Budzinski advised. However, she said the press would \u201clove this story\u201d and \u201cfinding a creative way to shake it I think is worth the effort.\u201d\\nMook agreed and added, \u201cI\u2019m just worried less experienced reporters won\u2019t understand that they\u2019re not a \u2018real\u2019 union.\u201d\\nNNU is, in fact, a \u201creal\u201d union. It is an AFL-CIO member union. It is also the largest union of registered nurses in the United States.\\nIn July 2015, Mook favored lobbying NNU leadership to prevent them from endorsing Bernie. That pressure clearly failed.\\nThe campaign pit the nurses of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) against the nurses of NNU, trotting them out to deaden the impact of NNU\u2019s support for Sanders. Campaign chairman John Podesta even seemed to welcome AFT president Randi Weingarten\u2019s pledge to \u201cgo after NNU and there [sic] high and mighty sanctimonious conduct.\u201d\\nIndividuals connected to the campaign continued to keep track of NNU and their efforts to support Sanders. Tina Flournoy of AFT notified the campaign when NNU sent out a press release condemning the Democratic National Committee for its attempt to rig the primary process by denying Sanders access to a master list of voters.\\nClinton campaign staff likely considered NNU \u201cfringe\u201d because the nurses union took a principled stand on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). They pushed for single-payer healthcare and still refuse to settle for anything less than Medicare for All.\\nAt a Democratic Platform Committee meeting in June, DeMoro criticized the ACA, as well as the Clinton campaign\u2019s proposals for incremental market-based reform that would barely address human needs.\\nClinton and DNC appointees to the Platform Committee blocked the Democratic Party from including language that would have suggested the party supports expanding Medicare to cover all Americans.\\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, while an improvement, is not good enough. It is structurally deficient [and] leaves healthcare as a system based on profit and ability to pay rather than patient need,\u201d NNU declared in a statement after the platform committee voted down the single-payer language.\\nIt still means tens of millions of American have no \u201chealth coverage or \u2018insurance\u2019\u201d because they cannot afford \u201chigh out of pocket costs.\u201d Plus, the law has systemic problems which undermine quality of care, and it is easy for the health care industry to game the system, NNU added.\\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration confirmed premiums under the ACA will go up about 25 percent. Many Americans will only have one insurance provider to choose from when buying insurance through exchanges.\\nThe spike further undermines the arguments of progressive establishment figures, who insist the ACA must be defended at all costs, including against calls to establish a universal health care system that would truly put people before profits.\\nFinally, some of the worst attacks from Democrats and the Obama administration came in 2009 and 2010 against groups and organizations, which did not immediately fall in line and support the ACA. They lashed out those committed to single-payer healthcare or a much weaker reform, the public option.\\nThe conduct of the Clinton campaign suggests this type of disdain for principled challenges from progressives will continue under a Clinton administration, and in fact, a Clinton administration may be more crude and vicious in their efforts to stamp out dissent.\\nThe post \u201cNot A \u2018Real\u2019 Union\u201d: Emails Show Clinton Campaign Attacks On Nurses appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n'"}, "time": 1742563264.9607093}
