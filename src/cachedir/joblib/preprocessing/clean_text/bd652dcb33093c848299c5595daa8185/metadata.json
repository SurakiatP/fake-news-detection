[Store surveillance video shows McDonald\u2019s employee Pedro Viloria jumping right out of the   window after noticing that an     police officer was lying   in her personal car, CBS Miami reports.  ONLY ON 10: Surveillance video shows a McDonalds worker jump from the drive thru window to save an unconscious police officer. More at 6pm. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Derek Shore (@DerekShore) March 14, 2017,  Viloria apparently saw that the officer\u2019s SUV was rolling uncontrolled in the drive through line and that the officer\u2019s children were inside yelling and acting very frightened. The employee quickly jumped out the window, ran to the car, and put the car in park to stop its roll. \u201cIn that moment, I thought, I\u2019d rather save that woman\u2019s life,\u201d Viloria told WPLG. \u201cI see she\u2019s like inflating her neck, like trying to breathe, like \u2018ahh,\u2019 and basically I thought something was going wrong. \u201d \u201cI thought, \u2018If those kids lose their mother today, that\u2019s going to be tragic,\u2019\u201d Viloria told the media. \u201cHer kids were screaming, \u2018Mother, mother, stop it, Mother what are you doing? \u2019\u201d Viloria added. Even as the valorous employee jumped into action, a firefighter paramedic happened to be walking onto the Doral, Florida, restaurant and after learning of the situation, quickly ran outside to give aide to the driver. Viloria was celebrated by local news and his employers, but the McDonald\u2019s employee waved off all the accolades saying that it was the paramedic and other first responders who arrived a short time later who gave the real   aid. The restaurant\u2019s owner released a statement congratulating Viloria. \u201cFirst and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the officer and her family during this difficult time. I think I speak for our McDonald\u2019s family when I say how proud we are of Pedro. He is an excellent employee, so it didn\u2019t surprise me that he took immediate action and jumped through a window to help save this woman. And he was not the only member of the team that played a pivotal role in ensuring she received the medical attention she needed. A second employee, who asked to remain unnamed, assisted with CPR. Their quick thinking and action were everything in that moment. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742564015.5356517}
