[Engaging in some advanced publicity for his new global warming film spectacular, \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel,\u201d Gore told Interview Magazine that God didn\u2019t create global warming and wants us to fix it.  In his comments, Gore equated the fight against global warming to a   moral crusade similar to the civil rights fight, women\u2019s suffrage, and the abolitionist movement during the Civil War era. Gore insisted that it is a moral imperative to fight against climate change. \u201cRegarding the climate movement,\u201d Gore said warming to his point, \u201cthere are people who say, \u2018God is in complete control of everything that happens, and if the Earth is getting warmer, then maybe God intends that. \u2019\u201d Gore then rejected that conceit. \u201cWell, no,\u201d the     former veep insisted. \u201cGod intends for us to take responsibility for how we treat God\u2019s creation, and if we choose to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer for   tons of   pollution every day, the consequences are attributable to us. \u201d He concluded saying, \u201cAnd if you are a believer, as I am, I think God intends for us to open our eyes and take responsibility for the moral consequences of our actions. \u201d Gore\u2019s new film is a sequel to his famed \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d a shockumentary filled with mistaken assertions and failed predictions. Despite the many inaccuracies of his previous film, in an interview last year Gore still insisted that he \u201cunderestimated\u201d how bad global warming is. \u201cI wish the film had   the seriousness of the crisis, but unfortunately it actually underestimated how serious it is,\u201d the   Tennessee Senator said.
