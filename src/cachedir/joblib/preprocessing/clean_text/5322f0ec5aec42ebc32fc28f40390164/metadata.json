[After being profiled by Breitbart Texas, Connecticut\u2019s 5th Congressional District candidate Craig Diangelo appeared on the Fox Business Network where he explained that currently, Americans have no   if their company wants to replace them with an   foreign worker.   \u201cIn the very beginning we did not know that we would be training our replacements,\u201d Diangelo told Fox Business\u2019 Charles Payne. \u201cWe had been called down to what they had called a \u2018town hall meeting\u2019 and this was in October of 2013. \u201d \u201cThe CIO, said that she would hold a town hall meeting to discuss the future of IT at our particular company, which at that time was known as Northeast Utilities,\u201d Diangelo said. \u201cWe all got into the room, all 220 of us, and she proceeded to tell us that \u2018Well folks, what we\u2019re going to do is we are going to outsource IT infrastructure and IT development. We have chosen two companies, Infosys and Tata, and the reason that we\u2019re doing this is because global workers can adjust to change a lot faster than the American worker. \u2019\u201d \u201cNow when you take a look at this, isn\u2019t the American worker also a global worker?\u201d Diangelo said. \u201cDon\u2019t we have some input into what\u2019s we say or what gets said in regards to a global economy? After all, we are a very large market. \u201d Diangelo also said the foreign workers replacing the Americans, in his experience, were not the   types that the open borders and big business lobby often tout. \u201cAs they were bringing over 220 employees, we were told that we would do knowledge transfer to these individuals coming over here,\u201d Diangelo said. \u201cAs we found out and as our company, our company at that time found out, the people coming over here from Southeast Asia did not have the job skills to actually take our positions. \u201d As Diangelo mentioned in an interview last week with Breitbart Texas, he is now looking to unseat      Rep. Elizabeth Esty ( ) saying he wants to revive the region of the state which was hit hard by multinational trade deals like NAFTA. \u201cI identify with the America First agenda,\u201d Diangelo said at the time. \u201cThis really is a big issue. \u201d John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.
