Partial transcript as follows: KORNACKI: An announcement by a Democrat  \u2014   I know he\u2019s one of the more moderate or conservative Democrats  \u2014   but an announcement by a Democrat Joe Manchin that\u2019s going to vote for this confirmation. What does this do, Howard Dean, to the question of a filibuster on the Democratic side? DEAN: Nothing. That\u2019s baked n. I expect two or three or four Democrats to vote for Judge Gorsuch. That is what their constituency wants. I can tell you right now if Judge Gorsuch if he\u2019s confirmed by Democrats  \u2014   that is unless we force McConnell to exercise the nuclear option  \u2014  if he\u2019s confirmed straight up with 60 votes, 10 of which are Democratic, the Democratic Senatorial committee might as well hang it up \u2019cause they\u2019ll never raise any money from our base.
