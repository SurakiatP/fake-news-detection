But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months. They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, and one with the head of a Russian   bank, Vnesheconombank, arranged at Mr. Kislyak\u2019s behest. The omissions, which Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer called an error, are particularly sensitive given the congressional and F. B. I. investigations into contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates. The Senate Intelligence Committee informed the White House weeks ago that, as part of its inquiry, it planned to question Mr. Kushner about the meetings he arranged with Mr. Kislyak, including the one with Sergey N. Gorkov, a graduate of Russia\u2019s spy school who now heads Vnesheconombank. Mr. Kushner\u2019s omissions were described by people with direct knowledge of them who asked for anonymity because the questionnaire is not a public document. While officials can lose access to intelligence, or worse, for failing to disclose foreign contacts, the forms are often amended to address lapses. Jamie Gorelick, Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, said that the questionnaire was submitted prematurely on Jan. 18, and that the next day, Mr. Kushner\u2019s office told the F. B. I. that he would provide supplemental information. Mr. Kushner\u2019s aides said he was compiling that material and would share it when the F. B. I. interviewed him. For now, they said, he has an interim security clearance. In a statement, Ms. Gorelick said that after learning of the error, Mr. Kushner told the F. B. I.: \u201cDuring the presidential campaign and transition period, I served as a    for foreign officials trying to reach the  . I had numerous contacts with foreign officials in this capacity.   \u2026     I would be happy to provide additional information about these contacts. \u201d No names were disclosed in that correspondence. Applicants for major national security positions must submit a lengthy F. B. I. questionnaire as part of a background check. They are asked to list the dates and details of all contacts with representatives of foreign governments. This is not just bureaucratic paperwork. The form warns that \u201cwithholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information\u201d could result in loss of access to classified information, denial of eligibility for a sensitive job and even prosecution knowingly falsifying or concealing material facts is a federal felony that may result in fines or up to five years imprisonment. Clearance holders are often allowed to amend disclosure forms and avoid punishment if omissions are deemed oversights rather than deliberate falsifications, and prosecutions are rare. Mr. Kushner is the second top White House official to have problems concerning his dealings with foreign officials. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, had his security clearance suspended and was fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the content of phone calls with the Russian ambassador during the transition. Last month, the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, confirmed to Congress that his agency was investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the election and the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Vnesheconombank is a target of American sanctions imposed in response to Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine. It is controlled by members of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government, including Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, and has been used to bail out oligarchs favored by Mr. Putin and to fund pet projects like the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Mr. Kushner has said he did not discuss sanctions with Mr. Gorkov, the Russian banker. Mr. Gorkov declined to comment on the subject of whether sanctions were discussed.'"}, "time": 1742562031.4155452}
