Horrifying. \\nIn another Wikileaks email , this time from Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council Marc Stanley to Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta dated February 11, 2016, Stanley lays out his best argument for why voters should choose Hillary over Bernie\u2026 \\n(click to enlarge) \\nHe writes: \\nI tell the voter that I like Bernie and I like Hillary, but that\u2019s not what matters. What matters to me is that there are 4 justices on the Supreme Court who will be in their 80\u2019s and be replaced by the next president \u2013 and that President will appoint 40 year old Justices and they will serve for 30 or 40 years. \\nHe goes on to say that voters shouldn\u2019t want Republicans making decisions about issues like Obamacare, Citizens United, voter rights, etc. and that Bernie is \u201ca 20-1 horse\u201d versus Hillary as a \u201c1-1 or even 2-1 horse\u201d. \\nCan you imagine it? Hillary being able to personally nominate four out of nine Supreme Court justices for life ? \\nHillary will own half the Supreme Court and for long after she\u2019s gone. \\nThat\u2019s seven out of nine\u2026 or the entire Supreme Court, basically. \\nThink about that for a second.
