They appear age 40-50; that is, mature yet vigorous. Their health maladies are corrected: \\nGeorge: wearing a grey business suit with the jacket off, white dress shirt with two unbuttoned front buttons, sleeves rolled up two times. His hair is business-short, just longer than military. His troubled teeth are now restored in perfect health. His 6\u20193\u201d physique is powerfully muscular on a large-boned frame; an athletic man who works out. His demeanor exudes controlled confidence. He sits next to Tom, and on the outside of the booth. \\nTom: wearing jeans, a 1/4 zip forrest green sweater, and tennis shoes. Tom\u2019s hair is on the longish side, fading red as is George\u2019s. He\u2019s almost as tall as George, but of medium frame and easy athleticism and elegance of a cat, with healthy appearance of a man who runs for fitness. Tom is attentive, not assertive, at times lounging in the corner of the booth. Tom and George\u2019s accents are not Southern by today\u2019s standards; with only a hint of how those dialects would develop. \\nJohn: At 5\u20196\u201d and unathletically portly, he wears dark navy dress slacks, a blue dress shirt with only one unbuttoned button, and sleeves buttoned. His hair is between the lengths of George and Tom, and balding. John is talkative, creatively intelligent, energetic, and at ease in a role of facilitator of our discussion. John\u2019s accent is Bostonian. \\n** \\nA few minutes early, I walk toward the entrance spotting Jefferson examining a flower box next to the door. His elegant fingers gently lift the leaves to his gaze. I approach behind him, and hug his upper arms. \\nCarl: (warm smile) Bro. \\nTom: (smooth and calm pivot to bro-hug) Carl. (looking back to the flowers) These annuals have about a month left until the first freeze kills them. Perhaps their seed will bloom into the brighter Spring we\u2019re all working for. (half-smile, and placing a hand on my shoulder as we walk into the tavern) \\nWashington sees us enter, and stands. Adams is preoccupied with a waiter to position three plates of lobster rolls and two orders each of beer flights. \\nGeorge: Gentlemen. \\nJohn: (turning with a broad smile) Ah! Thomas! Carl! Thank you for coming, thank you! (bro hugs) \\nCarl: Thank you ; all of you. Sir. (extending a hand to Washington, whose powerful hand engulfs it) \\nJohn: Please, friends, enjoy! (raising the first glass in the beer flight) To liberty. (all: \u201cTo liberty\u201d) \\nSo, please, everyone let\u2019s enjoy some conversation and sustenance! Let us speak as patriots and friends! (we all take note with appreciation of Adams\u2019 energy and intentionality as our facilitator) \\nTom: Carl, in combination with our previous conversation on July 4th , we thought it helpful to speak with interested readers before the so-called US \u201celection\u201d for a so-called \u201cpresident\u201d as the leader of so-called \u201cpublic information\u201d under limited government of a constitutional republic. \\nCarl: Good call. Who\u2019s up first? (raising my glass with my left hand to hide my right pointing to Adams sitting on my left) \\nJohn: (face already reddening, jumping at the opening) \u201cSo-called election,\u201d exactly! Don\u2019t ever call that a fucking \u201celection\u201d when there\u2019s nothing for the people to count! Those electronic voting machines are proven as election fraud tools of the elite! Carl, when you recount our conversation, put right fucking here the evidence! \\n(the three of us observing, again, appreciate Adams\u2019 straight-forward and to-the-point passion) \\nCarl: Will do, bro. \\nJohn: Fucking elite \u201cour blood is superior\u201d assholes! Fuck them and put them in fucking prison! \\nTom: (amused smile) Please, John. Don\u2019t hold back. \\nJohn: I\u2019m sorry, but what else can one say who isn\u2019t a .01% ass-kisser? Fooling the people every election with false promises is one thing, but then taking those elections away altogether is just fucked-up. \\nGeorge: Agreed. Prison is the only place for such criminals. \\nCarl: Here, bros; this two minute video will help: \\nTom: (in careful study) These videos are truly more powerful than just the pen. \\nJohn: Thank you, Carl. I know you\u2019ll present the evidence effectively. God Bless us all, I just don\u2019t know what else to do other than speak the truth! \\n(the evidence John requested) : \\nWhen Americans are told an election is defined by touching a computer screen without a countable receipt that can be verified, they are being told a criminal lie to allow election fraud . This is self-evident, but Princeton , Stanford , and the President of the American Statistical Association are among the leaders pointing to the obvious (and here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here ). Again, no professional would/can argue an election is legitimate when there is nothing for anyone to count. \\nGeorge: Thank you, John. Thomas? \\nTom: Yes, General. Americans embrace the ideals of the Declaration of Independence as who they are (lightly taps the table with his fist). This Brother and Sisterhood bound in Love resonates with all Americans not ensnared by the elite. \\nThis bond of love and equality demands truthful public information. \\nWhat Americans receive instead is \u201cofficial\u201d and corporate media lies of omission and commission to herd the people as work animals. \\nIt is the most vile and base disinformation that, Carl, your modern times most accurately assert as bullshit . Six corporations have been bought and owned for relentless lies to thinly veil a rogue state oligarchy. Without this constant \u201ccovering\u201d of crimes centered in money and war, Americans would end these crimes. \\nAs we discussed , I wrote a pamphlet of the people\u2019s rights contrasted with the tyrannical treatment we received from our own government. Tom Paine\u2019s Common Sense was discussed in every tavern of America. There are so many powerful journalists pointing to the facts today in 2016; an Emperor\u2019s New Clothes moment will come when people and God align for the bright light of truth to reveal all. \\nJohn: (smiling) That\u2019s why we had him write the Declaration of Independence. We thought Franklin could also do it, but he\u2019d throw in too many jokes. \\nGeorge: (a half-laugh, but not prone to much more, then gravitas) I shall conclude. \\nWithout military support, Americans are lost. From strategic necessity, I will say nothing of those evolving events. I can say this: outside of divine intervention, ordinary Americans must build a demand to arrest .01% criminal leaders for treason , Wars of Aggression , Crimes Against Humanity , destruction of the Bill of Rights , looting led by central banking , political assassinations that include President Kennedy and Martin King , and official lying with complicit media . \\nThese crimes are the opposite of the Declaration of Independence and US Constitution. \\nThe US has devolved into a viciously rogue state . \\nThere exists no argument against those facts except from the treasonous who only have bullshit in place of reason . As God watches over us, that truth will be made clear. (controlled passion in voice and eyes, with clenched fist tapped and held on our table) \\nWhen demand grows strong, patriots within military and government will act, and obviously within the law. They will honor their Oaths to defend humanity from a criminal elite who annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. \\nJohn: (raising his last glass) Here, here! \\nCarl: (addressing Washington) Sir, you\u2019ll appreciate these two minutes from Martin King : \\nGeorge: Silence in the face of these tyrants\u2019 crimes is betrayal to God and nation, yes. \\nTom: Perhaps we should remind readers how the oligarchs \u201cpay\u201d their minions, Carl. As I struggled to understand and express in my day , the fundamental economic crime is how our oligarchs create what is used as money: debt owed to them . \\nCarl, among many in alternative media, you document $1,000,000 per US household in withheld benefits (and here ) of an honest monetary system, with the .01% parasite-class hoarding about $30 trillion in off-shore tax-havens . \\nAmericans, and humanity, are being used as propagandized work animals. \\nJohn: They certainly fucking are! As you two (gesturing to Tom and me, spilling a little beer) help us understand, $30 trillion is thirty times what\u2019s needed to end global poverty and save a million children\u2019s lives every month! Americans must demand arrests of these demons who laugh as children die ! \\nTom: Yes. As you document , Carl, the total deaths from preventable poverty in just the last 20 years is more than from all wars and violence of any kind in all recorded human history . The .01% tyrant class, so-called \u201cleaders\u201d of so-called \u201cformer\u201d colonial powers have promised the end of poverty with just 0.7% of GNI since 1969, but prefer ongoing looting. They use those subjects as work animals, hoping they\u2019ll feel \u201clucky\u201d to have a job for the empire rather than slow, painful death from poverty. \\nEnding poverty decreases population growth rates in every historical case. The CIA reports that ending poverty is the best way to end terrorism. And the total investment over ten years for world peace and civilization is just about a trillion dollars: just 1/6th of what the US War Department reported \u201closing\u201d in 2016 if we were to pay for it all rather than all developed nations. \\nGeorge: There are no US \u201cPresidents,\u201d only puppets to lie and cover the looting. \\nCarl, please show your readers John Perkins \u2019 2-minutes of context as an illustration of what US Presidents execute: \\nJohn: The US is not just a rogue state , but a looting, lying, psychopathic, assassinating, child-killing, war-mongering, empire-driven, drug-dealing, minion-spawning, election-stealing, environment-and-food-poisoning, criminal pyramid! \\nPeople should \u201cvote\u201d for Truth about that , not some asshole, murdering, Left or Right arm puppet of the most vicious .01% fucks in all fucking history!! \\nWhat more do the Gods need to make clear that isn\u2019t already clear? Fuck!! \\nGeorge: (dead-pan) I have nothing to amend John\u2019s summary. \\nTom: (nodding to John) And he\u2019s the milder cousin compared to Sam. \\nCarl: (raising the last of my glasses) Well, gentlemen: to the breakthrough for a brighter future. \\n(all raise their glasses to that!) \\nTom: And Carl, you\u2019ll conclude your documentation of our meeting with the argument for .01% arrests for consideration of our American Brethren? \\nCarl: Of course. The Crimes The US is a literal rogue state empire led by neocolonial looting liars. The history is uncontested and taught to anyone taking comprehensive courses. If anyone has any refutations of this professional academic factual claim for any of this easy-to-read and documented content , please provide it. US ongoing lie-started and Orwellian-illegal Wars of Aggression require all US military and government to refuse all war orders because there are no lawful orders for obviously unlawful wars. Officers are required to arrest those who issue obviously unlawful orders. And again, those of us working for this area of justice are aware of zero attempts to refute this with, \u201cWar law states (a, b, c), so the wars are legal because (d, e, f).\u201d All we receive is easy-to-reveal bullshit . When Americans are told an election is defined by touching a computer screen without a countable receipt that can be verified, they are being told a criminal lie to allow election fraud . This is self-evident, but Princeton , Stanford , and the President of the American Statistical Association are among the leaders pointing to the obvious (and here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here ). Again, no professional would/can argue an election is legitimate when there is nothing for anyone to count. And, duh, corporate media are criminally complicit through constant lies of omission and commission to \u201ccover\u201d all these crimes. Historic tragic-comic empire is only possible through such straight-face lying, making our Emperor\u2019s New Clothes analogy perfectly chosen. The top three benefits each of monetary reform and public banking total ~$1,000,000 for the average American household, and would be received nearly instantly. Please read that twice. Now look to verify for yourself . Demanding arrests as the required and obvious public response rather than \u2018voting\u2019 for more disaster: \\nThe categories of crime include: Wars of Aggression (the worst crime a nation can commit). Likely treason for lying to US military, ordering unlawful attack and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of US military deaths. Crimes Against Humanity for ongoing intentional policy of poverty that\u2019s killed over 400 million human beings just since 1995 (~75% children; more deaths than from all wars in Earth\u2019s recorded history). \\nUS military, law enforcement, and all with Oaths to support and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, face an endgame choice: Demand arrests , with those with lawful authority to enact it. An arrest is the lawful action to stop apparent crimes , with the most serious crimes documented here meaning the most serious need for arrests. Watch the US escalate its rogue state crimes that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. \\nIn just 90 seconds , former US Marine Ken O\u2019Keefe powerfully states how you may choose to voice \u201cvery obvious solutions\u201d: arrest the criminal leaders (video starts at 20:51, then finishes this episode of Cross Talk ): Solutions worth literal tens of trillions to \u2018We the People\u2019: \\nAgain: The top three benefits each of monetary reform and public banking total ~$1,000,000 for the average American household, and would be received nearly instantly. Please read that twice. Now look to verify for yourself . We can quantify the end of the lie-started and illegal Wars of Aggression quickly into the trillions, and that said, it\u2019s worth a lot more than what we quantify. Truth : a world in which education is expressed in its full potential to only and always begin with good-faith effort for objective, comprehensive, and verifiable data. \\n\u201cInterview\u201d series:'"}, "time": 1742562990.4316866}
