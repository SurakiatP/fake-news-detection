Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, survived a    vote, 52 to 47, in the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Mr. Trump strains to install his cabinet. No Republicans broke ranks in their support of a colleague who will become the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official after two decades in the Senate. But the confirmation process  \u2014   ferocious even by the standards of moldering decorum that have defined the body\u2019s recent years  \u2014   laid bare the Senate\u2019s deep divisions at the outset of the Trump presidency. At the same time, the treatment of Ms. Warren, who was forced to stop speaking late Tuesday after criticizing Mr. Sessions from the Senate floor, rekindled the   politics that animated the presidential election and the women\u2019s march protesting Mr. Trump the day after his inauguration last month. Mr. Sessions cast his final vote as a senator to note that he was present for Wednesday\u2019s tally. His confirmation was met by applause from his colleagues, including a few Democrats, on the Senate floor. \u201cI can\u2019t express how appreciative I am for those of you who stood by me during this difficult time,\u201d Mr. Sessions said shortly after the vote. \u201cBy your vote tonight, I have been given a real challenge. I\u2019ll do my best to be worthy of it. \u201d Democrats spent the hours before the vote on Wednesday seething over the rebuke of Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, who had been barred from speaking on the floor the previous night. Late Tuesday, Republicans voted to formally silence Ms. Warren after she read from a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticized Mr. Sessions for using \u201cthe awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens\u201d while serving as a United States attorney in Alabama. Since Mr. Trump announced his choice for attorney general, Mr. Sessions\u2019s history with issues of race had assumed center stage. A committee hearing on his nomination included searing indictments from black Democratic lawmakers like Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who broke with Senate tradition to testify against a peer. For weeks, Republicans rejected suggestions that Mr. Sessions could not be trusted on civil rights, arguing that he had been tarnished unfairly over accusations of racial insensitivity that have dogged him since the 1980s. \u201cEverybody in this body knows Senator Sessions well, knows that he is a man of integrity, a man of principle,\u201d Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said during the debate on Wednesday afternoon. The \u201ctwisting\u201d of Mr. Sessions\u2019s record offended him, he said, even as Democrats continued their attacks on the nominee. As the 84th attorney general, Mr. Sessions brings a sharply conservative bent to the Justice Department and its 113, 000 employees. A former prosecutor, he promises a focus aligned with Mr. Trump in pushing a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda that includes tougher enforcement of laws on immigration, drugs and gun trafficking. Civil rights advocates worry, however, that he will reverse steps taken by the Obama administration in the last eight years to bring more accountability to police departments, state and local governments, and employers. Advocates point to his history of votes against various civil rights measures, as well as the accusations of racial insensitivity. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, said on Wednesday that on civil rights, immigration, abortion, criminal sentencing guidelines and a range of other issues, Mr. Sessions had been far outside the mainstream and had pushed \u201cextreme policies\u201d often targeting minorities. That criticism peaked with Tuesday night\u2019s rebuke of Ms. Warren, based on an arcane Senate rule that prevents members from impugning the character of a fellow senator, as she read the letter from Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mrs. King wrote the letter in response to Mr. Sessions\u2019s 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship, for which he was ultimately rejected in part because of accusations that he had been insensitive to minorities as a prosecutor. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, led the objection against Ms. Warren. His explanation afterward  \u2014   \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted\u201d  \u2014   instantly became a liberal rallying cry,   Ms. Warren as a leading voice of Democratic resistance to Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat hit me the hardest was, it is about silence,\u201d Ms. Warren told a group of civil rights leaders on Wednesday at the Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to shut people up. It\u2019s about saying: \u2018No, no, no. Just go ahead and vote. \u2019\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday that the censure was \u201ctotally, totally  \u201d and that it reflected an \u201c   attitude\u201d emanating from the White House. He and other Democrats said it served to mute legitimate criticism of Mr. Sessions\u2019s record on civil rights and racial issues  \u2014   one of their main avenues of attack at his contentious nomination hearing last month. The vote on Mr. Sessions came a day after Senate Republicans broke through a bottleneck in Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees by approving Betsy DeVos, the embattled Republican donor, as education secretary with the help of a tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. With Mr. Sessions\u2019s confirmation, votes are expected in coming days on the nominations of Representative Tom Price of Georgia for secretary of health and human services and Steven T. Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Mr. Sessions\u2019s path to confirmation hit another snag that riled Democrats and energized opponents of his nomination: Mr. Trump\u2019s dramatic firing of the acting leader of the Justice Department. Last week, Mr. Trump abruptly dismissed Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, setting off a fierce backlash from Democrats against Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination to fill her job permanently. Ms. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, had refused to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s controversial order barring travel by some foreigners, which is now tied up in litigation in federal courts. Democrats seized on her firing to say that Mr. Sessions is too close to the president to be independent or stand up to him. As the first senator to support Mr. Trump\u2019s   bid for president last year, Mr. Sessions became an influential campaign adviser. While he pledged repeatedly not to be \u201ca mere rubber stamp\u201d for the White House, Democrats asserted that he would not be willing to challenge legally questionable policies like the travel ban or the president\u2019s threats to reinstitute the use of torture on terrorism suspects. The arguments failed to sway any Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted, 11 to 9, along party lines last week to approve Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed confidence that Mr. Sessions would be a \u201cfair and evenhanded\u201d attorney general and would make good on his pledges to enforce even the laws he voted against in the Senate. \u201cThere should be no question,\u201d Mr. Grassley said, \u201cthat he is more than qualified to be the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562584.591309}
