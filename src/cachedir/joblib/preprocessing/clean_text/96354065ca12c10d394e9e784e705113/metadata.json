If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isn\u2019t your idea of a good movie time, though, I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow. You may not grasp who the   creatures with simian arms and woolly mammoth tusks are or why they seem permanently engorged with rage. But there\u2019s more to movies than narrative coherency, as anyone who has sampled the cinema of Michael Bay or certain art films well knows. There is in this movie, for starters, the visual appeal of those Blutoesque beings, lovingly fabricated and ornamented   creations who share their name with the creatures that J. R. R. Tolkien called orcs. Tolkien borrowed orc from the Old English, citing \u201cBeowulf,\u201d one of the many tales of blood lust and vengeance, heroes and monsters that are woven into the \u201cWarcraft\u201d DNA. The ruler here is King Llane (Dominic Cooper) a rather progressive monarch who fights the invading orcs with a multihued army, a rakish    (Travis Fimmel) a token chick (Paula Patton) and a magical twosome (Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer). If there\u2019s a mythology here, I missed it, much as I also missed the charm and periodic lightness of Tolkien\u2019s world, with its hobbits and Shire. \u201cWarcraft\u201d by contrast weighs in as a Hobbesian war of all against all, though it does allow for a little romance and campy winks. It also, more surprisingly, offers some   notably with Durotan (Toby Kebbell) an orc chieftain with hands as big as Volkswagen Beetles and a pregnant mate, Draka (Anna Galvin). He has qualms as well as enemies, which surface amid battles and exposition. Stuff happens in one part of this world, and other stuff happens elsewhere: Jaws clench, bodies fall, and scenes oscillate  \u2014   \u2019twas ever thus, genrewise. Even so, despite the incessant clashing and clanging, you can hear the tremulous pulse of a heartbeat. That faint thrumming belongs to Duncan Jones, the director who, against the odds, has mined a watchable movie out of an entertainment franchise that started with a video game and now includes novels, comics and assorted schlock (toys, costumes, a   set). That Mr. Jones even factors into this production counts as some kind of actual achievement given that \u201cWarcraft\u201d is such an obvious bid at brand expansion, which may be why no one bothered with an intelligible story. Apparently, branded content (i. e. the characters, their world) was meant to be enough. Whether you see more here will depend on your mileage and patience, though moviegoers habituated to   (and the perfunctory she) pulverizing one another for 100 or so minutes are likely to have greater tolerance for this diversion than others might. As suggested, trying to figure out who\u2019s doing what to whom and why  \u2014   or how orcs dress with such huge hands or how they chew steak with those tusks  \u2014   is often pointless when it comes to spectacles. In cinema\u2019s earliest years, moviegoers thrilled not to stories but what the scholar Tom Gunning calls \u201cthe cinema of attractions,\u201d with its   shocks and tricks we\u2019re still getting pummeled, story or no. Mr. Jones doubles down on the action, though without any real shocks (or awe) but he also modestly complicates the question of the monstrous. The orcs in \u201cWarcraft\u201d prove somewhat more psychologically complex than any number of cartoon Hollywood villains  \u2014   they\u2019re sincere, for one  \u2014   and they\u2019re generally better company than the king and his crew. It says something about Mr. Jones\u2019s choices that he gives Durotan so much screen time and that Mr. Kebbell, with the help of the   wizards, makes good use of that time with a nuanced,   turn that evokes   gladiators like Victor Mature. Durotan is a beautiful brute, and all the more human for it. \u201cWarcraft\u201d is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). Heads pop like grapes and so forth. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.'"}, "time": 1742561719.6768928}
