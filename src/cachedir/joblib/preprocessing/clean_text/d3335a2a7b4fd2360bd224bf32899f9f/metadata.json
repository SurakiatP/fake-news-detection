Officials then transferred him to the Limestone Correctional Facility, which has a \u201cbehavioral modification program\u201d known among prisoners as a \u201chot bay\u201d dorm in which prisoners are forced to live in pairs in hot and squalid solitary confinement cells.\\nKinetik, also known as Robert Earl Counsil, is the second leader of the Free Alabama Movement (FAM) to be transferred to Limestone. FAM is a group of incarcerated people and their families struggling to end prison slavery and shed light on inhumane conditions in Alabama\u2019s prison system.\\nJames Plesant, also known as Dhati Khalid, was the first leader to be transferred. Melvin Ray, also known as Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun, is the last remaining leader of FAM not to be transferred to Limestone.\\nAccording to a statement released by the Ordinary People Society, an Alabama-based human rights group for the incarcerated, Kinetik refused meals upon arrival at the Kilby Correctional Facility on October 21. Before the transfer, Kinetik spent three years housed in solitary confinement at the Holman Correctional Facility.\\nAs previously reported by Shadowproof, Kilby is said to be a \u201c bully camp .\u201d When one Alabama prisoner learned of Kinetik\u2019s transfer to Kilby, he explained the prison is where they send those that \u201cthey have to iron out with brutality.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen they send you to Kilby, that\u2019s where they break your arms and break your legs.\u201d\\nPrison officials turned off the water to Kinetik\u2019s cell in response to his hunger strike, advocates say. \u201cThey are trying to kill him,\u201d argued Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, founder of the Ordinary People Society and an \u201coutside\u201d spokesperson for FAM. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections is currently facing a federal investigation into the rampant violence, overcrowding, and structural decay in its prison system. Kinetik believes his transfer was an act of retaliation by prison officials for his political activity, and that they timed the transfer to prevent him from meeting with this lawyer.\\nKinetik is an outspoken advocate for the human rights of the incarcerated. Along with Dhati Khalid and Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun, Kinetik and the Free Alabama Movement were some of the people behind the call-to-action for the national prison strike against prison slave labor, which began on September 9.\\nProminent human rights lawyer and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, Bryan Stevenson, announced he will work with Pastor Glasgow and look into Kinetik\u2019s case.\\nBennu Hannibal Ra-Sun told Shadowproof the \u201cbehavioral modification\u201d dorm or Hot Bay like the one at Limestone is \u201csupposed to be a volunteer program where you volunteer to go into it, but there\u2019s no volunteer aspect. They\u2019re just putting people in it.\u201d\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have anything specific that you\u2019ve done. They\u2019re not serving you any paperwork, there\u2019s not any kind of due process, and they\u2019re getting funding from it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to justify funding, they have to have bodies.\u201d\\n\u201cReally what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re targeting individuals,\u201d Bennu said. He noted there is a Hot Bay program at Donaldson, where he is incarcerated. \u201cThat\u2019s where James Plesant was originally. T hey framed him. They\u2019re constantly framing and jumping on people in that Hot Bay.\u201d\\nIn the Hot Bay, prisoners are denied visitation, religious services, recreation, and social services, according to the Free Alabama Movement.\\n\u201c[The Hot Bay] is worse than solitary confinement because they take all of your property and you have a cell mate,\u201d Bennu said. \u201cSo the one here at Donaldson is two men to a cell. You\u2019re in the cell with another person for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Y\u2019all defecating with each other. Y\u2019all urinating with each other, passing gas, burping, sleeping, waking up. Constantly, you\u2019re in the cell with the door locked 24/7 with someone else.\u201d\\n\u201cThey\u2019re sending you up there, they\u2019re torturing people up there. People first got exposed to the Hot Bay program from Bibb County,\u201d Bennu recalled.\\n\u201cThere was a bunch of young guys in there. They tore the Hot Bay up,\u201d he said, referring to a July 2015 riot. \u201cThey made it where you couldn\u2019t stay in it. They had to get everyone out of there. That\u2019s how bad they are. That\u2019s how bad it was.\u201d\\n\u201cA lot of people think that when they say they put us in solitary confinement that it\u2019s solitary confinement. In and of itself, that constitutes the torture. It\u2019s not just putting me in the cell. It\u2019s the conditions that they put me in inside of these cells,\u201d Bennu argued.\\nHe continued, \u201cThey put us in contaminated cells. What they do is, they have people in solitary and they be complaining about the plumbing or complaining about the lights or the ventilation or something. And they will put us in those cells.\u201d\\n\u201cThey already know there are issues\u2014there\u2019s plumbing issues, there\u2019s maintenance issues, and they\u2019ll put us in these, what they call \u2018black out cells\u2019 or contaminated cells. The lights won\u2019t work, we\u2019ll be in the cells in the dark trying to read, ruining our eyesight. The mattress will be torn up, sleeping on top of these concrete slabs. The water will be leaking, running all over the cell. The vents and stuff are filthy. \u201c\\n\u201cIt\u2019s all of these elements that are added on, but that doesn\u2019t show up in the paperwork, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done to people like myself. They put me in an isolated cell. I\u2019m on what they call, \u2018Walk Along Status.\u2019 That means I cannot interact with anyone. I can\u2019t be around another person. Same thing with Kinetik and James Plesant,\u201d Bennu concluded.\\nA prisoner previously explained to Shadowproof that Limestone is \u201cwhere they send everybody and you have to spend one year in isolation.\u201d That prisoner hoped Kilby was not a \u201clayover\u201d on Kinetik\u2019s way to Limestone.\\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t reach Limestone, he\u2019ll be okay,\u201d the prisoner said at the time. According to the website for the Alabama Department of Corrections, Kinetik is now incarcerated at Limestone.\\nThe post Alabama Prison Officials Retaliate Against Prison Strike Leader By Cutting Water To Cell appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n'"}, "time": 1742561775.3165064}
