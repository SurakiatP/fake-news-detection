Will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the Nov 8th election, or is this just clever Democrat party smoke and mirrors? It seems that Washington\u2019s political tricksters have already sprung into action\u2026 \\nAfter Comey\u2019s shock announcement, a \u201cleaked\u201d memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to Fox News , in which Comey and the FBI seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. \\nELITE CIRCLES: FBI head James Comey and friend Hillary Clinton. \\nCertainly, a desperate Democratic Party, and an even more desperate Obama White House (over the last 3 weeks, Obama and his wife Michelle have been out campaigning more that Hillary Clinton herself), could be pressuring or nudging the FBI on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against Donald Trump. Aside from the obvious potential of another Clinton scandal, yesterday\u2019s FBI move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios: Protect the President, who is already deeply tied to the Clinton email cover-up Democratic Party Machine has created a distraction to cover-up latest Wikileaks dump. FBI are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring Hillary Clintons. Create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious Trump scandal next week. \\nNOTE: Despite calls from the Clinton camp for FBI to disclose what they have (which they cannot by law anyway, you\u2019d think Hillary would have already known that), it is highly unlikely that the FBI will release any real specifics before the election \u2013 if they have anything at all. It\u2019s just too early to tell. \\nSEE ALSO: FBI James Comey was board member of HSBC \u2013 Clinton Foundation & Drug Cartel \u2018bank of choice\u2019 \\nThe FBI director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the Justice Department seek an indictment against Clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation \u2013 allowing Clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election \u2013 despite the fact that Comey stated to a Congressional investigative committee that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless,\u201d and that Clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the US Secretary of State. \\nZero Hedge adds: \\n\u201cNow, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. Needless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcorats\u2019 trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.\u201d \\nHere is \u201cleaked\u201d (aka \u2018just covering my ass) memo from FBI director James Comey: \\nWatch this space. Here is a highlight reel of Hillary Clinton lying on at least 5 occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server: \\n.
