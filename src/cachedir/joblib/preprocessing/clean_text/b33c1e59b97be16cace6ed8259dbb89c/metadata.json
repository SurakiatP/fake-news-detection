[Speaking to Kleine Zeitung, the Formula 1 investor called the decision of key politicians to open the borders  \u2014   which resulted in Europe\u2019s migration crisis  \u2014   \u201cunpardonable\u201d noting that \u201cif a company were to make mistakes on the same scale, it would have gone broke\u201d. Highlighting the \u201chypocrisies\u201d of what he called the \u201crefugees welcome brigade\u201d with regards to migration, Mateschitz said: \u201cI am talking about the fact that none of the people shouting \u2018refugees welcome\u2019 or [Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s famous phrase] \u2018we can do it\u2019 were preparing their own guest rooms or tents in their gardens to accommodate half a dozen migrants. \u201cEven then it was clear to everyone that most of the people [arriving in the continent] did not correspond to the definition of the refugee. In any case, not the Geneva Convention\u201d. In the interview, Mateschitz took a stand against the \u201cdestabilisation of Europe\u201d which he said threatens the \u201cuniqueness of [the continent\u2019s] diversity and individuality with its different cultures and languages\u201d. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s worried that one of the highest officials in Brussels said that countries which aren\u2019t multicultural should be wiped off the map\u201d Mateschitz told the newspaper, possibly alluding to comments made by European Commission   Frans Timmermans in 2015. \u201cAny society, anywhere in the world, will be diverse in the future  \u2014   that\u2019s the future of the world,\u201d Timmermans said, demanding that Eastern and Central EU nations undergo similar demographic transitions to Western Europe. Of political correctness, Mateschitz said: \u201cIt seems that no one dares to tell the truth, even if everyone knows what the truth is. \u201d\u201cThe elites want citizens to be frightened, and easily manipulated,\u201d he added.  The Red Bull founder said he sees numerous problems plaguing the European Union (EU) the architects of whom he fingered as belonging to a \u201c  intellectual elite\u201d with nothing to contribute to the continent. \u201cPolicies which are steeped in political correctness have been imposed in the name of a     intellectual elite who have nothing to contribute to our country neither economically nor culturally despite their best intentions,\u201d he said. Mateschitz also poured scorn on how Russia has been framed as the EU\u2019s nemesis by large parts of the media and Western liberal establishment, telling Kleine Zeitung: \u201cI do not need anyone to tell me who my enemies are. \u201dCriticising attempts to destroy the former Soviet superpower through economic sanctions, the Formula 1 investor pointed out that \u201cfor Europe as a whole [this policy] results in losing billions of Euros\u201d. Challenged by the Austrian newspaper with the assertion that he too is an \u2018elite\u2019 Mateschitz hit back, describing himself as a \u201chumanist\u201d but \u201csomeone who basically opposes any dogma\u201d. Speaking about banning the Islamic veil, a talking point in Austria currently, the Red Bull boss said: \u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to think that this is really a matter of any importance   \u2026     It\u2019s silly to make a political issue out of something like this when there are far more pressing matters. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563676.5779269}
