So what did she do about it? She took their money, and sent them arms. Mainstream media won't touch this with a 10-foot pole. Posted on October 27, 2016 by administrator in News , US // 0 Comments \\nWikiLeaks have released an email in which Hillary Clinton admits that Qatar and Saudi Arabia \u2013 two of her mega-donors \u2013 provide financial and logistical support to ISIS. \\nIn the extraordinary email , sent to John Podesta in 2014, Clinton lays out an eight point plan to defeat ISIS in Iraq, and mentions that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are both giving financial and logistical support to the Islamic State and other extremist Sunni groups. \\nShe conveniently fails to mention that these two terror-funding states are both mega-donors to the Clinton Foundation. Qatar has given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and Saudi Arabia has donated upwards of $25 million dollars to the Foundation. \\nNowhere in the email \u2013 sent, of course, through the notorious unsecured server \u2013 does Clinton address the staggering hypocrisy of continuing to provide Saudi Arabia with multiple billions in weapons, arms, aircraft, and other support in full knowledge of its active support for terrorists. \\nHillary Clinton has known since at least 2014 that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar provide \u201c clandestine financial and logistic support \u201d to ISIS and other radical Islamic groups \u2013 but, rather than refuse their money and call for a halt of arms sales and support, she has campaigned for more money and tried to increase their supply of arms. \\nArming ISIS \\nIn an email revealed in the Intercept earlier this year, Jake Sullivan, then Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff, celebrated the sale to Saudi Arabia of more than 80 Boeing F-15SA fighter jets \u2013 \u201c along with upgrades to the pre-existing Saudi fleet of 70 F-15 aircraft and munitions, spare parts, training, maintenance, and logistics \u201d \u2013 with the heading addressed to Clinton, \u201c FYI \u2014 good news .\u201d \\nGood news \u2013 at least for Clinton, Saudi Arabia, and ISIS. And evidence of the cozy love-in doesn\u2019t stop there. Ever wonder what a Clinton administration\u2019s top priorities will be? Jobs? Healthcare? Education? More like arming ISIS. A top Clinton aide described a $60 billion weapons transfer of fighter jets and helicopters to Saudi Arabia as a \u201c top priority .\u201d \\nSaudi Arabia is the largest customer of U.S. military sales in the world with \u201c active and open cases valued at approximately $97 billion ,\u201d according to a White House fact sheet that championed the U.S.\u2019 strong relationship with the terror-sponsoring state. \\nMedia blackout \\nEven in a period of America\u2019s history in which mainstream media repeats what one of the most powerful political dynasties in the country keeps on repeating to exhaustion \u2013 accusing Russia of \u201crigging\u201d the U.S. election without offering any proof to back their claims \u2013 it is still astonishing that major outlets are refusing to report on this story. \\nIs it that Qatar\u2019s and Saudi Arabia\u2019s funding of ISIS \u2013 while funding their favorite American candidate at the same time \u2013 is a difficult issue to report on? Or is the gutless and hopelessly biased media\u2019s refusal to cover this topic rooted in fear that thoroughly addressing it will cause her to lose the presidential election? \\nThe press have given Clinton a free ride in this campaign. By failing to live up to their duties in a functioning democracy, the fourth estate have played their part in erecting a demon. Unencumbered by the law, unscrutinized by the media, Clinton will wield a dictator\u2019s authority.\""}, "time": 1742562342.3637815}
