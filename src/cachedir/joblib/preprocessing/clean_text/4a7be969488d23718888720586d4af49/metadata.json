Despicable Balfour: A Story of Betrayal \u2013 Part 1 By Stuart Littlewood on October 29, 2016 by Stuart Littlewood \\nNovember 2 marks the centenary of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which began the still-ongoing colonisation of Palestine and sowed the seeds of an endless nightmare for the Palestinian people, both those who were forced to flee at gunpoint and those who have managed to remain in the shredded remains of their homeland under Israel\u2019s brutal military occupation. \\nA movement called the Balfour Declaration Centenary Campaign is urging action and wants an apology. \u201cWe call on the international community and all peace and justice loving people to join the campaign to call on the Government and Parliament of the United Kingdom to: \\n1 Reject the Balfour Declaration including its role as an instrument of displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian people; \\n2 Issue an official apology to the Arab Palestinian people for their role in issuing the Balfour Declaration and making possible the displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian people \\n3 Acknowledge their historic, legal and moral responsibility for damages sustained as a result of the implementation of the Balfour Declaration \\n4 Institute reparations to the Palestinian people in accordance with the provisions and principles of international law, justice and equity, which guarantee the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their homeland and the right of self-determination.\u201d \\nA Century of Ethnic Cleansing and Denial of Palestinian Rights A seventeen-year-old girl trembling with grief and rage told me how she witnessed her teenage cousin being shot through the head by Israeli soldiers. They had been walking to school together and the soldiers were taunting him. In response he had picked up a rock. She accused me and all Americans of knowing about these daily abuses against Palestinians but not caring. I tried to tell her that most Americans do not know about these tragedies, and that we would never support those who perpetrate them. But her belief that the average American is savvy about international politics was as strong as it was naive. \u201cOf course Americans know we\u2019re suffering over here,\u201d she retorted.\u201cYou\u2019re the most powerful nation on earth. And everyone has a television. I know you know.\u201d \\nThese words are from David Hazard\u2019s excellent book Blood Bothers , which charts the life of Father Elias Chacour, a remarkable Christian Palestinian who grew up on the shores of Galilee and saw his beautiful world shattered by the Israeli occupation. Like countless others he was made a refugee in his own country. \\nAmericans aren\u2019t alone in ignorance of their complicity. British people too seem largely unaware of how tragedy was allowed to overtake the Palestinians, and how this once-peaceful province of the Ottoman Empire, renowned for its antiquities and culture, became a land scarred by conflict, where everyday the humiliation of illegal occupation stokes the fires of hatred. You cannot get in or out, or move around, without running the gauntlet of Israeli customs, baggage searches, roadblocks and checkpoints under the sneer of contemptuous, sunglassed troops. Even in remote countryside you\u2019ll run into one of six or seven hundred armed checkpoints. And that\u2019s what visitors have to put up with. Imagine what it\u2019s like for residents. \\nThe Israeli Defence Force is largely made up of National Servicemen and women \u2013 teenagers drafted in and trained to use lethal force. They have a reputation for being trigger-happy. Of course, they don\u2019t all wish to play the thug or necessarily agree with their orders. \\nThe truth about Palestine doesn\u2019t sit well with Britain\u2019s now crumbling reputation for fair play. Its name has been airbrushed from maps and purged, like a dirty word, from the diplomatic lexicon. Even today the subject is only haphazardly taught in our schools. For older generations like mine it was never on the curriculum. To understand why, one must at least dip a toe into the complicated history of the last 100 years. To help readers over this hurdle, I offer this \u2018potted\u2019 version. At least it will explain why, ten years ago, I went to see Palestine for myself. For centuries long our land enslaved by Turkish kings with sharpened blade. We prayed to end the Sultan\u2019s curse, the British came and spoke a verse. \u201cIt\u2019s World War One, if you agree to fight with us we\u2019ll set you free.\u201d The war we fought at Britain\u2019s side, our blood was shed for Arab pride. At war\u2019s end Turks were smitten, our only gain, the lies of Britain. \\nStephen Ostrander\u2019s simple verse manages to cut through a mountain of rhetoric to the root cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict. \\nThere was a Jewish state in the Holy Land some 3,000 years ago, but the Canaanites and Philistines were there first. The Jews, one of several invading groups, left and returned several times, and were expelled by the Roman occupation in 70AD and again in 135AD. Since the 7th century Palestine has been mainly Arabic. During the First World War the country was \u2018liberated\u2019 from Turkish Ottoman rule after the Allied Powers, in correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon and Sharif Hussein ibn Ali of Mecca in 1915, promised independence to Arab leaders in return for their help in defeating Germany\u2019s ally. \\nAt the same time, however, a new Jewish political movement called Zionism was finding favour among the ruling \u00e9lite in London, and the British Government was persuaded by the Zionists\u2019 chief spokesman, Chaim Weizman, to surrender Palestine for their new Jewish homeland. Hardly a thought, it seems, was given to the earlier pledge to the Arabs, who had occupied and owned the land for 1,500 years \u2013 longer, say some scholars, than the Jews ever did. \\nThe Zionists, fuelled by the notion that an ancient Biblical prophecy gave them the title deeds, aimed to push the Arabs out by inserting millions of Eastern European Jews. They had already set up farm communities and founded a new city, Tel Aviv, but by 1914 Jews numbered only 85,000 to the Arabs\u2019 615,000. The infamous Balfour Declaration of 1917 \u2013 actually a letter from the British foreign secretary, Lord Balfour, to the most senior Jew in England, Lord Rothschild \u2013 pledged assistance for the Zionist cause with apparent disregard for the consequences to the native majority. Calling itself a \u201cdeclaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations\u201d, it said: \\n\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing and non-Jewish communities\u2026.\u201d \\nBalfour, a Zionist convert, later wrote: \\n\u201cIn Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country. The four powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long tradition, in present needs, in future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now occupy that land.\u201d \\nThere was opposition. Lord Sydenham warned: \u201cThe harm done by dumping down an alien population upon an Arab country may never be remedied. What we have done, by concessions not to the Jewish people but to a Zionist extreme section, is to start a running sore in the East, and no-one can tell how far that sore will extend.\u201d \\nThe American King-Crane Commission of1919 thought it a gross violation of principle. \u201cNo British officers consulted by the Commissioners believed that the Zionist programme could be carried out except by force of arms. That, of itself, is evidence of a strong sense of the injustice of the Zionist programme.\u201d \\nThere were other reasons why the British were courting disaster. A secret deal, called the Sykes-Picot Agreement, had been concluded in 1916 between France and Britain, in consultation with Russia, to re-draw the map of the Middle Eastern territories won from Turkey. Britain was to take Jordan, Iraq and Haifa. The area now referred to as Palestine was declared an international zone. The Sykes-Picot Agreement, the Balfour Declaration and the promises made earlier in the McMahon-Hussein letters all cut across each other. It seems to have been a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right was doing in the confusion of war. \\nSome distinguished Jews opposed a \u2018national home\u2019 in Palestine \\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917 Lenin released a copy of the confidential Sykes-Picot Agreement into the public domain, sowing distrust among the Arabs. Thus the unfolding story had all the makings of a major tragedy. Subsequent crimes \u2013 on both sides \u2013 flow from this triple-cross. The Zionist organization asked permission to submit its proposal for Palestine to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, hitching a ride on the British request to be granted a mandate over Palestine in order to implement the Balfour Declaration. The Zionist case included the statement that \u201cthe land itself needs redemption. Much of it is left desolate. Its present condition is a standing reproach. Two things are necessary for that redemption \u2013 a stable and enlightened government, and an addition to the present population which shall be energetic, intelligent, devoted to the country, and backed by the large financial resources that are indispensable for development. Such a population the Jews alone can supply.\u201d \\nProminent US Jews opposed to this move handed President Woodrow Wilson a counter-statement objecting to the Zionists\u2019 plan, and asked him to present it to the peace conference. It said the scheme to reorganise the Jews as a national unit with territorial sovereignty in Palestine \u201cnot only misrepresents the trend of the history of the Jews, who ceased to be a nation 2000 years ago, but involves the limitation and possible annulment of the larger claims of Jews for full citizenship and human rights in all lands in which those rights are not yet secure. For the very reason that the new era upon which the world is entering aims to establish government everywhere on principles of true democracy, we reject the Zionistic project of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.\u201d \\nForeseeing the future with uncanny accuracy, it went on to say, \u201cWe rejoice in the avowed proposal of the Peace Congress to put into practical application the fundamental principles of democracy. That principle, which asserts equal rights for all citizens of a state, irrespective of creed or ethnic descent, should be applied in such a manner as to exclude segregation of any kind, be it nationalistic or other. Such segregation must inevitably create differences among the sections of the population of a country. Any such plan of segregation is necessarily reactionary in its tendency, undemocratic in spirit and totally contrary to the practices of free government, especially as these are exemplified by our own country.\u201d \\nThe counter-statement quoted Sir George Adam Smith, a noted biblical scholar and the acknowledged expert on the region, who had said: \u201cIt is not true that Palestine is the national home of the Jewish people and of no other people\u2026 It is not correct to call its non-Jewish inhabitants \u2018Arabs\u2019, or to say that they have left no image of their spirit and made no history except in the great Mosque\u2026 Nor can we evade the fact that Christian communities have been [there] as long as ever the Jews were\u2026 These are legitimate questions stirred up by the claims of Zionism, but the Zionists have not yet fully faced them\u201d. \\nAmerica, England, France, Italy, Switzerland and all the most advanced nations of the world, it said, are composed of representatives of many races and religions. \u201cTheir glory lies in the freedom of conscience and worship, in the liberty of thought and custom which binds the followers of many faiths and varied civilizations in the common bonds of political union\u2026. A Jewish State involves fundamental limitations as to race and religion, else the term \u2018Jewish\u2019 means nothing. To unite Church and State, in any form, as under the old Jewish hierarchy, would be a leap backward of two thousand years. \\nTasked with dispossessing Palestinians and expanding the Jewish State\u2026 Israeli troops: teenage gunslingers sometimes friendly, sometimes not. All the time I was aware of a third guard nearby with a gun on my back. \\n\u201cWe ask that Palestine be constituted as a free and independent state, to be governed under a democratic form of government recognizing no distinctions of creed or race or ethnic descent, and with adequate power to protect the country against oppression of any kind. We do not wish to see Palestine, either now or at any time in the future, organized as a Jewish State .\u201d \\nBut Wilson apparently failed to put the document before the Conference. \\nIn 1922 the League of Nations placed Palestine under British mandate, which incorporated the principles of the Balfour Declaration. Jewish immigration would be facilitated \u201cunder suitable conditions\u201d and a nationality law would allow Jews taking up permanent residence to acquire Palestinian citizenship (in sharp contrast to the Jews-only law now operated by a dominant Israel). But the high commissioner was soon recommending a halt to Jewish immigration for fear that it would create a class of landless Arabs. That same year the British government, aware of Arab concerns that the Balfour Declaration was being interpreted in an \u201cexaggerated\u201d way by Zionists and their sympathisers, issued a White Paper to clarify the position. \\n\u201cThe terms of the Declaration referred to,\u201d it said, \u201cdo not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded \u2018in Palestine\u2019. In this connection it has been observed with satisfaction that at a meeting of the Zionist Congress, the supreme governing body of the Zionist Organization, held at Carlsbad in September, 1921, a resolution was passed expressing as the official statement of Zionist aims the determination of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people on terms of unity and mutual respect, and together with them to make the common home into a flourishing community, the upbuilding of which may assure to each of its peoples an undisturbed national development\u2026 \\n\u201cIt is also necessary to point out that the Zionist Commission in Palestine, now termed the Palestine Zionist Executive, has not desired to possess, and does not possess, any share in the general administration of the country. Nor does the special position assigned to the Zionist Organization in Article IV of the Draft Mandate for Palestine imply any such functions. That special position relates to the measures to be taken in Palestine affecting the Jewish population, and contemplates that the organization may assist in the general development of the country, but does not entitle it to share in any degree in its government. \\n\u201cFurther, it is contemplated that the status of all citizens of Palestine in the eyes of the law shall be Palestinian, and it has never been intended that they, or any section of them, should possess any other juridical status. \\n\u201cIt is necessary,\u201d said the White Paper with masterly ambiguity, \u201cthat the Jewish community in Palestine should be able to increase its numbers by immigration. This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacity of the country at the time to absorb new arrivals. It is essential to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment.\u201d \\nHowever, the White Paper flatly denied that a promise had been made to the Arabs ahead of the Balfour Declaration. \u201cIt is not the case, as has been represented by the Arab Delegation, that during the war His Majesty\u2019s Government gave an undertaking that an independent national government should be at once established in Palestine. This representation mainly rests upon a letter dated the 24th October, 1915, from Sir Henry McMahon, then His Majesty\u2019s High Commissioner in Egypt, to the Sharif of Mecca, now King Hussein of the Kingdom of the Hejaz. That letter is quoted as conveying the promise to the Sharif of Mecca to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories proposed by him. But this promise was given subject to a reservation made in the same letter, which excluded from its scope, among other territories, the portions of Syria lying to the west of the District of Damascus. This reservation has always been regarded by His Majesty\u2019s Government as covering the vilayet of Beirut and the independent Sanjak of Jerusalem. The whole of Palestine west of the Jordan was thus excluded from Sir Henry McMahon\u2019s pledge. \\n\u201cNevertheless, it is the intention of His Majesty\u2019s government to foster the establishment of a full measure of self-government in Palestine . But they are of the opinion that, in the special circumstances of that country, this should be accomplished by gradual stages\u2026\u201d \\nFrom then on, the situation would go from bad to worse. Despicable Balfour: A Story of Betrayal \u2013 Part 2 \\n\\nNovember 2 marks the centenary of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which began the still-ongoing colonisation of Palestine and sowed the seeds of an endless nightmare for the Palestinian people. The UK Government needs to make amends for its crimes against the Holy Land. Campaigners are calling on it to apologise. \\nPart 2 continues the Story of Betrayal\u2026. \\nIn 1937 the Peel Commission declared that British promises to Arabs and Zionists were irreconcilable and unworkable. Too late, Britain dropped its commitment to the Zionists and began talking about a Palestinian state with a guaranteed Arab majority and protection for minorities. \\nThe Zionists reacted furiously. Their underground military wing, the Haganah, and other armed groups, unleashed a reign of terror in the run-up to World War II. They continued their attacks on the British after the war and tried to bring in hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees. \\nIn 1946 they blew up the south wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which housed the British mandatory government, killing 91. This terrorist act was ordered by David Ben-Gurion in retaliation for the arrest of Haganah, Irgun and Stern Gang members suspected of attacks on the British. He then thought better of it and cancelled the operation but Menachem Begin, who led the Irgun, went ahead. Both Ben-Gurion and Begin, who had a big price on his head as a wanted terrorist, became Israeli prime ministers. \\nThroughout this period the United States were reluctant to allow Jews fleeing Europe to enter the empty spaces of North America, preferring to play the Zionist game and see them funnelled into Palestine. In 1945 the new US president, Harry Truman, offered Arabs this excuse: \u201cI am sorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands of those who are anxious for the success of Zionism; I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my constituents.\u201d \\nHowever, Truman was frequently exasperated by the Zionist lobby and on one occasion had a delegation thrown out of the White House for their table-thumping antics. He wrote: \u201cI fear very much that the Jews are like all underdogs. When they get on top they are just as intolerant and cruel as the people were to them when they were underneath.\u201d \\nAmerican author Gore Vidal provided an intriguing insight. \u201cSometime in the late 1950s, that world-class gossip and occasional historian, John F. Kennedy, told me how, in 1948, Harry S. Truman had been pretty much abandoned by everyone when he came to run for president. Then an American Zionist brought him two million dollars in cash, in a suitcase, aboard his whistle-stop campaign train. \u2018That\u2019s why our recognition of Israel was rushed through so fast.\u2019 As neither Jack nor I was an antisemite (unlike his father and my grandfather) we took this to be just another funny story about Truman and the serene corruption of American politics.\u201d \\nBy now this monster Britain had breathed life into, was running out of control. The Arabs, tricked and dispossessed, were outraged. The collision has been fatally damaging to the West\u2019s relationship with Islam ever since. As the violence escalated, Gandhi was moved to comment: \u201cPalestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English. They (the Jews) have erred grievously in seeking to impose themselves on Palestine with the aid of America and Britain and now with the aid of naked terrorism.\u201d \\nWith the mandate about to expire in 1948 an exhausted Britain handed over the problem to the United Nations and prepared to quit the Holy Land, leaving a powder-keg with the fuse fizzing. The newly-formed UN thought it would save the situation by partitioning Palestine into Arab and Jewish states and making Jerusalem an international city. But this gave the Jews 55 percent of Palestine when they accounted for only 30 percent of the population. The Arab League and the Palestinians of course rejected it. Map 1: 1947 UN Partition of Palestine Under the UN Partition Plan the Jews received 55% of the country (including both Tel Aviv/Jaffa and Haifa port cities, the Sea of Galilee and the resource-rich Negev) although they accounted for only a third of the population (548,000 out of 1,750,000) and owned only 6% of the land. The Jewish community accepted the Partition Plan; the Palestinians (except those in the Communist Party) and the Arab countries rejected it. \\nThe UN Partition of Palestine never did stand close scrutiny. At that time, as some commentators have pointed out, UN members did not include African states, and most Arab and Asian states were still under colonialist regimes. The UN was pretty much a white colonialist club. The Palestinians themselves had no representation and they weren\u2019t even consulted. \\nThe first vote failed to reach the required two-thirds majority: 25 for partition, 13 against and 19 abstentions. To ensure success in the second vote a good deal of arm-twisting was applied to the smaller countries, but again it fell short. At the third attempt France was persuaded to come \u201con board\u201d after the US threatened to withdraw desperately needed post-WW2 aid, and on November 29 the UN voted to partition Palestine into three parts: a Jewish state on 14,000 sq km with some 558,000 Jews and 405,000 Palestinian Arabs; and an Arab state on 11,500 sq km with about 804,000 Palestinian Arabs and 10,000 Jews. Jerusalem, including major religious sites, would be a \u2018corpus separatum\u2019, internationally administered. Map 2: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories By the end of the 1948 war Israel controlled 78% of the country, including half the territory that had been allocated by the UN to the Palestinians. Around 750,000 Palestinians living in what became Israel were made refugees: only 100,000 remained in their homes. More than 418 villages (two-thirds of the villages of Palestine) were systematically destroyed by Israel after their residents had left or been driven out. The Arab areas were now reduced to 22% of the country, the West Bank was taken by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt. The 1949 Armistice Line (the \u201cGreen Line\u201d) remains the de facto boundary of the State of Israel until today. Since 1988, when thePalestinians recognized Israel within that boundary, it has been the basis of the two-state option. \\nThis ludicrous carve-up was quickly followed by shameful incidents at Deir Yassin, Lod and Ramle. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were uprooted from their homes and lands and to this day are denied the right to return. They received no compensation, and after their expulsion Jewish militia obliterated hundreds of Arab villages and towns. No sooner had Britain packed her bags than Israel declared statehood on 14 May 1948 and immediately set about expanding control across all of Palestine. \\nThe following day, 15 May, is remembered by Palestinians as the Day of al-Nakba (the Catastrophe), which saw the start of a military terror campaign that forced three-quarters of a million Palestinians from their homeland to make room for the new Jewish state. Some 34 massacres were allegedly committed in pursuit of Israel\u2019s territorial ambitions. \\nAn event permanently etched on the Palestinian memory is the massacre at Deir Yassin by Zionist terror groups, the Irgun and the Stern Gang. On an April morning in 1948 130 of their commandos carried out a dawn raid on this small Arab town with a population of 750, to the west of Jerusalem. The attack was initially beaten off, and only when a crack unit of the Haganah arrived with mortars were the Arab townsmen overwhelmed. The Irgun and the Stern Gang, smarting from the embarrassment of having to summon help, embarked on a \u2018clean-up\u2019 operation in which they systematically murdered and executed at least 100 residents \u2013 mostly women, children and old people. The Irgun afterwards exaggerated the number, quoting 254, to frighten other Arab towns and villages. The Haganah played down their part in the raid and afterwards said the massacre \u201cdisgraced the cause of Jewish fighters and dishonoured Jewish arms and the Jewish flag\u201d. \\nDeir Yassin signaled the ominous beginning of a deliberate programme by Israel to depopulate Arab towns and villages \u2013 and destroy churches and mosques \u2013 to make room for incoming Holocaust survivors and other Jews. In any language it was an exercise in ethnic cleansing, the knock-on effects of which have created an estimated 4 million Palestinian refugees today. \\nBy 1949 the Zionists had seized nearly 80 percent of Palestine, provoking the resistance backlash they so bitterly complain about today. Many Jews condemn the Zionist policy and are ashamed of what has been done in their name. \\nUN Resolution 194 had called on Israel to let the Palestinians back onto their land. It has been re-passed many times, but Israel is still in breach. The Israelis also stand accused of violating Article 42 of the Geneva Convention by moving settlers into the Palestinian territories it occupies, and of riding roughshod over international law with their occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. But expulsion and transfer were always a key part of the Zionist plan. According to historian Benny Morris no mainstream Zionist leader was able to conceive of future co-existence without a clear physical separation between the two peoples. David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister, is reported to have said: \u201cWith compulsory transfer we have a vast area (for settlement)\u2026I support compulsory transfer. I don\u2019t see anything immoral in it.\u201d \\nHe showed astonishing candour on another occasion when he remarked: \u201cIf I were an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. We have taken their country. Sure, God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs. We come from Israel, it is true, but 2,000 years ago, and what is that to them? There has been anti- Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country.\u201d \\nGeneral Moshe Dayan, hero of the Six Day War (1967), made it known to Palestinians in the territories that \u201cyou shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wishes, may leave, and we shall see where this process will lead.\u201d That appears to have been the general attitude ever since. \\nIn 1967 Israel perceived a number of Arab threats designed to check Zionist ambitions, including a blockade of their Red Sea port. In a series of pre-emptive strikes against Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq, Israel succeeded in doubling the area of land under its control. \\nIndeed, in the wake of the 1967 Six Day War Israel confiscated over 52 percent of the land in the West Bank and 30 percent of the Gaza Strip, violating both international law and the UN Charter, which says that a country cannot lawfully make territorial gains from war. It was reported that Israel demolished 1,338 Palestinian homes in the West Bank and detained some 300,000 Palestinians without trial. \\nThe UN issued Security Council Resolution 242, stressing \u201cthe inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\u201d and calling for \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\u201d. It was largely ignored, thus guaranteeing further discord in the region. \\nIsrael\u2019s most notorious prime minister, Ariel Sharon, made a name for himself in 1953 when his secret death squad, Unit 101, dynamited homes and massacred 69 Palestinian civilians \u2013 half of them women and children \u2013 at Qibya in the West Bank. His troops later destroyed 2,000 homes in the Gaza Strip, uprooting 12,000 people and deporting hundreds of young Palestinians to Jordan and Lebanon. Then in 1982 he masterminded Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, which resulted in a massive death toll of Palestinians and Lebanese, a large proportion being children. An Israeli tribunal found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps and removed him from office. But he didn\u2019t stay in the background for long. \\nBy the end of 1967 there were just 3 illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. By the end of 2005 the total was 177. \u201cWhen we have settled the land,\u201d the then chief of staff of the Israeli Defence Force, Rafael Eitan, remarked in 1983, \u201call the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle.\u201d \\nBy 2015 there were 196 illegal Israeli settlements in addition to 232 settler outposts in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the Applied Research Institute \u2013 Jerusalem, and upwards of 750,000 settlers residing there. \\nApartheid and occupation: \u201cin practice there is little difference\u201d \\nSo what sort of person was responsible for this misery and mayhem in the Holy Land \u2013 the \u201crunning sore\u201d Lord Sydenham predicted? At Cambridge Arthur Balfour read moral sciences (no, seriously!). Much good it did the poor Palestinian Arabs he helped dispossess. \\nDescribed as born lazy, aloof and having an attitude problem, he was convinced of his personal superiority and wished to keep the vulgar world at arm\u2019s length. Balfour famously remarked: \u201cNothing matters very much, and few things matter at all.\u201d \\nHe had been Prime Minister (1902-1905) and was regarded as weak. At the time of the Declaration blunder he was Foreign Secretary. In the words of one commentator Balfour\u2019s career \u201cstretches before our eyes in a flat and uneventful plain of successful but inglorious and ineffective self-seeking\u201d. He was said to be a man who would make almost any sacrifice to remain in office. In this case, he sacrificed the Arab homeland. In 1922 the League of Nations put Palestine under British mandate, which incorporated the principles of the Balfour\u2019s Declaration. \\nHow have things turned out? \\nJohn Dugard, a professor of international law and former Special Rapporteur to the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, explained on Aljazeera the differences and similarities between apartheid South Africa and apartheid Israel. \\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/11/201111395153781378.html \\nOf course, the regimes of apartheid and occupation are different. Apartheid South Africa was a state that practised discrimination against its own people. It sought to fragment the country into white South Africa and black Bantustans. Its security laws were used to brutally suppress opposition to apartheid. Israel, on the other hand, is an occupying power that controls a foreign territory and its people under a regime recognised by international law [as] belligerent occupation. \\nHowever, in practice, there is little difference. Both regimes were/are characterised by discrimination, repression and territorial fragmentation (that is, land seizures). \\nIsrael discriminates against Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in favour of half a million Israeli settlers. Its restrictions on freedom of movement, manifested in countless humiliating checkpoints, resemble the \u201cpass laws\u201d of apartheid. Its destruction of Palestinian homes resembles the destruction of homes belonging to blacks under apartheid\u2019s Group Areas Act. The confiscation of Palestinian farms under the pretext of building a security wall brings back similar memories. And so on. Indeed, Israel has gone beyond apartheid South Africa in constructing separate (and unequal) roads for Palestinians and settlers. \\nApartheid\u2019s security police practised torture on a large scale. So do the Israeli security forces. There were many political prisoners on Robben Island but there are more Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails. \\nApartheid South Africa seized the land of blacks for whites. Israel has seized the land of Palestinians for half a million settlers and for the purposes of constructing a security wall within Palestinian territory \u2013 both of which are contrary to international law. \\nDugard suggested there is sufficient evidence for a legitimate enquiry into the question whether Israel violates the prohibition of apartheid found in the 1973 Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. \\nSydenham\u2019s \u201crunning sore\u201d has been festering for a century, crippling the Middle East and turning the Holy Land into an abomination. Balfour and his fellow Zionist stooges in the corridors of British power clearly had no understanding of the true purpose and base methods of Zionism. \\nThis is also true of present-day Christian-Zionists. Some Christian churches have rejected Zionist doctrine as false teaching that corrupts the biblical message of love, justice and reconciliation. They deplore the cosy relationship between Christian Zionist leaders and the governments of Israel and the United States that impose their pre-emptive borders and domination over Palestine. And they condemn the teachings of Christian Zionism that support those policies as they encourage racial exclusivity and perpetual war. \\nIn other words, no Christian with a functioning brain cell should touch Zionism with a bargepole. Yet the upper echelons of our government and many Western churches are riddled with Zionist sympathisers. Unless they are smoked out, a hundred years from now an outraged civil society will still be calling for government apologies for the actions of that lunatic Balfour and his successors.
