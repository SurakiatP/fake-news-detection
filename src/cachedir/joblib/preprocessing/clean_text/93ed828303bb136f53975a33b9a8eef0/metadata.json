Share on Facebook \\nAt the meeting of experts at the Valdai Club in Sochi on October 27, Putin said about the U.S. elections: \u201ca look at various candidates\u2019 platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould \u2013 the difference is slight, if there is any.\u201d \\nPutin called U.S. stories of \u201cRussian hacking the U.S. election\u201d as a \u201cmythical and imaginary problem\u201d and \u201cthe hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election,\u201d instead of focusing on the domestic issues: \\n\u201cThe United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police. You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.\u201d \\n\u201cDoes anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people\u2019s choice? America is not some kind of \u2018banana republic\u2019, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.\u201d \\nPutin reminded us who the real rulers are: \\n\u201cThe expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things \u2013 stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.\u201d \\nReferring to the Western elites\u2019 downplaying the growing gap between rich and poor, Putin said: \\n\u201cIt seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favor of the suzerain.\u201d \\nPutin reminded everyone that current situation of instability in the world is a direct result of the choice made by the United States after the end of the Cold War to take \u201cthe course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.\u201d By taking this course, the U.S. missed a chance to make globalization \u201cmore harmonious and sustainable in nature.\u201d \\nIn their euphoria of winning the Cold war, the United States \u201cessentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalization and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this.\u201d \\nThis victorious attitude led to the system of international relations where \u201crules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely. \u201c \\nOn the Western hypocrisy and double talk, Putin said: \\n\u201cIf the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.\u201d \\nRussian president reminded about the U.S.-led decision \u201cto launch airstrikes in the center of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya,\u201d and turning the UN into a tool of U.S. foreign policy: \\n\u201cThe operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favor these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defense systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.\u201d \\nIn the global economy, multilateral institutions also became a tool to promote the interests of few: \\n\u201cWe see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organization and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organization itself aside and build a new one instead.\u201d \\nAlways referring to the U.S. as \u201csome of our partners,\u201d Putin stressed that they \u201cdemonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today.\u201d Instead of making OSCE, \u201ca crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security,\u201d it was shaped into \u201can instrument in the service of someone\u2019s foreign policy interests.\u201d \\nAbout constant vilification of Russia and trumpeting of \u201cRussian aggression,\u201d Putin said: \u201cthey continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the \u2018Russian military threat\u2019. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower\u2019s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders. \\nOf course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilization against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. \\nIt is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims. \\nThe question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?\u2019 '"}, "time": 1742561648.0805042}
