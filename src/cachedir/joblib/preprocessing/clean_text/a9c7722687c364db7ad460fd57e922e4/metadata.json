The increasingly ugly   tone to the campaign over  next week\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, coupled with the violence of English fans at the European soccer championships and now the killing of a lawmaker on the streets of a small town, has left many here feeling that the boundaries of acceptable behavior are breaking down. \u201cWhat we are just seeing generally is a very disturbing shift in British politics,\u201d said Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform, which favors British membership. \u201cIt is quite upsetting to me what is happening. \u201d With next Thursday\u2019s vote on the referendum only days away, campaigning was suspended as a gesture of mourning and respect for the victim, Jo Cox, 41, a rising star in the opposition Labour Party who, not coincidentally, was a strong backer of Britain\u2019s remaining inside the bloc. While it is still too early to say how the attack will change the dynamics of the campaign, it has unquestionably shifted the focus from the growing momentum of those in favor of leaving to the   tactics they have employed as the vote has drawn closer. The suspect arrested in the killing, Thomas Mair, 52, has a history of mental illness. But he was also reported to have been in contact with   groups in the United States and Britain, and to have said, \u201cBritain first!\u201d several times as he attacked Ms. Cox. Britain First, a   nationalist group, denied any links with Mr. Mair, but a United States civil rights group said he had been associated with an American   organization called the National Alliance. In a widely distributed piece written for the magazine The Spectator, which favors leaving the European Union, Alex Massie drew a connection between the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign, which has featured outlandish assertions, xenophobia and Islamophobia, to the death of Ms. Cox. \u201cSometimes rhetoric has consequences,\u201d Mr. Massie wrote. \u201cIf you spend days, weeks, months, years telling people they are under threat, that their country has been stolen from them, that they have been betrayed and sold down the river, that their birthright has been pilfered, that their problem is they\u2019re too slow to realize any of this is happening, that their problem is they\u2019re not sufficiently mad as hell, then at some point, in some place, something or someone is going to snap. And then something terrible is going to happen. \u201d Mr. Massie cited a poster that had been issued earlier on Thursday by one of the campaigns for British exit led by Nigel Farage, the leader of the U. K. Independence Party, which has been strongly   and   from its inception and won 13 percent of the vote in the national election in May 2015. In the last stages, opponents say, the Leave campaign has essentially become a UKIP campaign on the putative dangers of immigration  \u2014   given that membership in the bloc means freedom of travel and work for all its citizens  \u2014   softened around the edges by Conservatives who say that as a great nation, Britain will be truly sovereign only away from Brussels. The poster showed a long line of Middle Eastern refugees waiting to cross a European border. The text said: \u201cBREAKING POINT. The E. U. has failed us all. We must break free from the E. U. and take control of our borders. \u201d Never mind that the border in question was that between Croatia and Slovenia, and that Britain as an island nation is largely insulated from the immigration crisis that roiled the Continent last year. The message, Mr. Massie said, was not subtle: \u201cVote Leave, Britain, or be overrun by brown people. Take control. Take back our country. You know what I mean, don\u2019t you: If you want a Turk  \u2014   or a Syrian  \u2014   for a neighbor, vote Remain. \u201d The official and unofficial Leave campaigns have suggested that Turkey and its 77 million Muslims are soon to join the European Union, which is untrue, and that despite Britain\u2019s restrictions on free travel for European citizens, membership in the European Union has made Britain more vulnerable to waves of refugees and terrorism. While the claims may be unsubstantiated, pollsters suggest that the focus on Turkey and on regaining \u201ccontrol\u201d over immigration was behind the movement toward a British exit, or Brexit, which is now narrowly leading most polls. \u201cWhen you shout BREAKING POINT over and over again, you don\u2019t get to be surprised when someone breaks,\u201d Mr. Massie wrote. \u201cWhen you present politics as a matter of life and death, as a question of national survival, don\u2019t be surprised if someone takes you at your word. You didn\u2019t make them do it, no, but you didn\u2019t do much to stop it either. \u201d Some observers, like Mr. Tilford, say there is blame to be spread across the political spectrum. While the tenor of the Leave campaign \u201cis pretty xenophobic,\u201d he said, both of the major mainstream parties, Labour and the Conservatives, now regularly discuss the potential menace of foreigners. \u201cThat has made it socially acceptable to voice   or xenophobic sentiment in a way that it wasn\u2019t 10 years ago,\u201d he said. The more practical question is whether the murder of Ms. Cox will alter the trajectory of the campaign. Some analysts, like Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group, said it \u201cwill hurt the momentum of the \u2018Leave\u2019 campaign, which has been gaining steadily in recent polls. \u201d But others drew the opposite conclusion. \u201cUntil it\u2019s clear who was responsible and what their motivation was or might have been,\u201d said John Curtice, a political scientist from Strathclyde University, \u201call it does is stop the campaign when the Remain side probably would not want it to be stopped. \u201d Polly Toynbee, a columnist for the   Guardian newspaper, said that the murder of a public official could not be seen as an isolated episode. \u201cIt occurs against a backdrop of an ugly public mood in which we have been told to despise the political class, to distrust those who serve, to dehumanize those with whom we do not readily identify,\u201d Ms. Toynbee wrote.  Of course, many who are campaigning to leave are honorable democrats, she said. \u201cBut there are others whose recklessness has been open and shocking. I believe they bear responsibility, not for the attack itself, but for the current mood: for the inflammatory language, for the   the dog whistling and the overt racism. \u201d Ms. Cox herself wrote a column in The Yorkshire Post, published just a few days before her death, in which she sympathetically discussed people\u2019s concerns about immigration. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean to say they are racist or xenophobic,\u201d she said, but concerned about pressures on health and social services and competition for jobs. She added, \u201cMost people recognize that there are positive sides of migration too. \u201d But the benefits of European Union membership are \u201chuge\u201d and far outweigh the costs, Ms. Cox wrote, explaining that \u201cI strongly believe that concerns about immigration  \u2014   as legitimate as they are  \u2014   are not a reason to vote for Brexit,\u201d in large part because leaving itself would not solve the problem. \u201cPlease don\u2019t fall for the spin prior to June 23 that the only way to deal with concerns about immigration is by voting to leave  \u2014   that simply is not the case,\u201d she concluded. Her husband, Brendan Cox, issued a statement after her death, saying that his wife \u201cwould have wanted two things above all else to happen now  \u2014   one, that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628502.8078413}
