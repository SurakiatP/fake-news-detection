Doesn\u2019t Nike have to actually bring its brand to American shores and make this sneaker inside of our borders and actually pay people in America to make a shoe they\u2019re asking people to buy?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little bit hypocritical for Nike to say that equality is everywhere when it\u2019s paying workers overseas   of what they would have to pay for an American to make this?\u201d he added. Travis went on to call what Nike has with its Indonesian employees \u201cIndonesian virtual slave labor. \u201d \u201cI guess everybody\u2019s equal and there are no boundaries as long as you don\u2019t live in Indonesia,\u201d he concluded.
