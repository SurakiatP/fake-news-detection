[The book is now being published through Milo\u2019s own \u201cDangerous Books\u201d publishing house, after former publisher Simon and Schuster decided to drop the title. That decision was made despite the fact that the book had already received over 75, 000   according to Milo.    activists, journalists, and celebrities celebrated the cancellation of Dangerous months ago. However, the relaunched book has already surpassed Chelsea Clinton\u2019s She Persisted, R. J. Palacio\u2019s Wonder, Ben Sasse\u2019s The Vanishing American Adult, and Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, coming in at number four on the Amazon best sellers list at the time of this writing (UPDATE: Dangerous has now reached #1 on Amazon\u2019s best sellers list). \u201cThis is the book the liberals didn\u2019t want you to read, they did everything they could to stop it and nonetheless we persisted, and my fans have stuck by my side,\u201d said Milo to Red Alert Politics. \u201cI\u2019m releasing the book on Independence Day because we\u2019re freeing ourselves of political correctness, social justice warriors, censorship, the corrupt leftist media, and   feminism. \u201d Conservative commentator Ann Coulter has claimed that \u201cFat people will hate this book,\u201d while PayPal   billionaire entrepreneur, and presidential adviser Peter Thiel allegedly declared, \u201cIf you don\u2019t use your freedom of speech, one day you might find that it\u2019s gone. Buy this book while it\u2019s legal. \u201d Dangerous is currently available to   on Amazon in both hardcover and ebook formats, and will be released on July 4, with an audiobook narrated by Milo himself coming soon.
