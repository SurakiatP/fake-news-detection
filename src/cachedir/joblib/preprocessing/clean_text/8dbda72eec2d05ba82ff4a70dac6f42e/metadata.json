Pop minimalism inhabits a sliding scale, as the xx seem determined to illustrate. \u201cOn Hold\u201d is the lead single from its third album, \u201cI See You,\u201d set for release in January. It opens in churchly quiet, with Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim exchanging rueful intimacies about the end of a love affair. \u201cWhen and where did we go cold?\u201d moans Mr. Sim. \u201cI thought I had you on hold. \u201d None of this is a stretch. But then the texture of the track opens up: an   beat burbles up, a bass line kicks in, and wait, is that a digitally manipulated sample of Hall and Oates? (Why yes, of course.) Jamie xx has been working in this vein as a D. J. and solo artist, and it\u2019s promising to consider what it could mean for the group as it moves ahead. NATE CHINEN \u201cBoy you shoulda got me   you shoulda held the door\u201d: exasperation is perhaps Bibi Bourelly\u2019s peak mode, and it is bracing on the seething \u201cFlowers,\u201d from her new    EP \u201cFree the Real (Pt. #2). \u201d Ms. Bourelly, who has written songs for Rihanna and is still coming into her own as performer, can be unsteady  \u2014   not in a performed way, but in the manner of someone who knows her destiny is to drive a beautiful tank but is still learning how to finesse the gears. Or maybe she never will: On \u201cPerfect,\u201d a duet with the   Earl St. Clair, she dismantles regressive standards of beauty and  : JON CARAMANICA One of the most formally ambitious, eerily pertinent albums to emerge in recent weeks was \u201cReal Enemies,\u201d by the ultramodern big band known as Darcy James Argue\u2019s Secret Society. An adaptation of a multimedia piece presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last year, it traffics brilliantly in the syntax of American conspiracy theories, drawing from historical episodes, speculative fiction and the political writing of Richard Hofstadter and others. Depending on your state of mind this week, it could be just what you need to hear or precisely the opposite either way, it\u2019s sure to strike a chord. And while the piece is meant to be digested whole, it\u2019s possible to find meaning in a single track  \u2014   like \u201cApocalypse Is a Process,\u201d which begins with a disquieting stir of flutes and woodwinds, and then features a fine tenor saxophone solo by Sam Sadigursky, along with a sampled voice making a remark both urgent and cryptic: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer. \u201d N. C. Look, maybe you just want to watch Shia LaBeouf freestyle for four minutes in which he boasts about replacing Tom Hanks, calls himself \u201cJewish \u2019Pac to this music with a twist of Whitman,\u201d takes shots at Lil Yachty and announces, \u201cTruth is, I\u2019m a true   white kid with B. I. G. in a Coogi tatted to me. \u201d And, hey, no judgment  \u2014   comedy heals. J. C. Because what the world needs now is a gleaming   track from Giorgio Moroder. Because the vocal performance, by Karen Harding, is soulful and sure. Because there\u2019s something touchingly upbeat about the main hook in the chorus: \u201cSometimes it feels like you\u2019re too good for me. \u201d N. C. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen my ex since we broke   \u2018cause he didn\u2019t want to grow up,\u201d Rena Lovelis, the lead singer of Hey Violet, sings at the top of the sinister single \u201cGuys My Age. \u201d But then comes the twist: \u201cNow I\u2019m out here wearing something    get attention from a  . \u201d For the last couple of years, pop by young women has been tacking toward resistance  \u2014   to gender norms, to the male gaze, to entrenched sexism. \u201cGuys My Age\u201d stands on the shoulders of those songs, embracing their mood, their musical approach  \u2014   groaning, gloomy synthesized pop  \u2014   and puts it in service of sexual authority, a whole different way of dismissing ignorance. J. C. The personal and the universal were already partly entwined on \u201cLove Me Now,\u201d the current single by John Legend. It\u2019s a pledge of loving devotion, his specialty, that brushes against larger uncertainties. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s gonna kiss you when I\u2019m gone,\u201d he sings in the chorus. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna love you now, like it\u2019s all I have. \u201d Gone where? He doesn\u2019t say exactly, but the tension in the song has to do with forces outside his control. Now a video for the song, directed by Nabil Elderkin, amplifies the idea: There\u2019s Mr. Legend on a couch, singing to his wife, Chrissy Teigen, and their young daughter. But there, too, are couples against more troubled backdrops, like the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota and a refugee camp in northern Iraq. The core message  \u2014   love is universal, and all the more crucial in a difficult time  \u2014   seems likely to resonate elsewhere on Mr. Legend\u2019s next album, \u201cDarkness and Light,\u201d due on Dec. 2. N. C. Here is something offhandedly great: a club recording from Mike Watt\u2019s first solo tour, in 1995. Mr. Watt, the punk workhorse and former bassist in the Minutemen, was working with material from \u201c  or tugboat?\u201d  \u2014   his debut album, crowded with cameos from the postpunk and   scenes. The tour recreated those conditions, mainly putting him in an   power trio with Eddie Vedder on guitar and Dave Grohl on drums. (Mr. Grohl, then recently of Nirvana, had brought his new band, the Foo Fighters, on tour as an opening act Mr. Vedder, best known as Pearl Jam\u2019s frontman, was there with another opener, Hovercraft.) The set has a looseness that squares well with its low center of gravity it\u2019s satisfying just to hear Mr. Grohl and Mr. Watt lock into a heavy groove. But there\u2019s also a   quality to these songs, which valorize underground notions of integrity. Consider \u201cAgainst the \u201970s,\u201d with an impassioned guest vocal by Mr. Vedder: \u201cBaby boomers, selling you rumors of their history,\u201d he sings. \u201cForcing youth away from the truth of what\u2019s real today. \u201d N. C. In its original incarnation, on the most recent Coldplay album, \u201cEverglow\u201d is a piano ballad tastefully padded with sonic accouterments: electric bass, pealing guitars, stark and unobtrusive drums. The song has now been further pruned, to something resembling an unplugged solo performance by Chris Martin, on piano and vocals. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be a Coldplay single without some earnest flicker of grandiosity, so here too is Muhammad Ali, talking in 1977. \u201cWe need somebody in the world to help us all make peace,\u201d he says, referring to the example he hopes to set for himself. N. C. Julian Lage is a guitarist with spring in his step, the sort of improvising musician who radiates ease and good feeling even on tricky terrain. And he\u2019s in emblematic form on \u201cLive in Los Angeles,\u201d a   digital album now on iTunes and Apple Music. Recorded in June at the Blue Whale, it features Mr. Lage\u2019s trio with Scott Colley on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums  \u2014   the same players heard on \u201cArclight,\u201d a studio album released this spring. Rather than an acoustic or   guitar, Mr. Lage works in this trio with a Telecaster, which brings more grit and bite to his sound. His playing on \u201cNocturne,\u201d a country waltz, puts him in roughly the same county as Bill Frisell, but with a touch and temperament entirely his own. N. C.'"}, "time": 1742563940.63815}
