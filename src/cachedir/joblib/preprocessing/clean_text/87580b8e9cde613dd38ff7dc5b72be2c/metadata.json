Jerusalem will be His \u201cburdensome stone\u201d with which He judges the world. \\n\u201cThe lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.\u201d Proverbs 16:33 (KJV) \\nAs Americans who love this country, it is absolutely crystal-clear who we should vote for. Only one candidate\u2019s campaign slogan is Make America Great Again, only one candidate says that they will # DrainThe Swamp . I think you get the idea. But you can be a patriotic America and not be a Christian, right? Trump: It\u2019s Time To Drain The Swamp In Washington, D.C \u2013 Five-Point Plan For Ethics Reform So is the a compelling, overarching reason why a Bible believing Christian should vote for Donald Trump? Yes, there is \\nDonald Trump has made as part of his platform a promise to move the American Embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to its new location in Jerusalem. In fact, it was signed into law in 1995, read this: \\nThe Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , no later than May 31, 1999, and attempted to withhold 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for \u201cAcquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad\u201d as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened. The act also called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. Israel\u2019s declared capital is Jerusalem, but this is not internationally recognized, pending final status talks in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict . The United States has withheld recognition of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. The proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93\u20135),and the House (374\u201337). \\nContained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act is a prophecy bombshell , perhaps when you skimmed through it just now you missed so let me break it out for you, ready? \\n\u201c\u2026called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. \\nNow please pause at this juncture and think about what that means for a Bible believer. Do you know why the Palestinians have, for 20 years, refused to accept the so-called Two State Solution ? Because the Two State Solution does not give Jerusalem to Palestine, it gives it to its rightful owner, Israel. The Battle of Armageddon will be fought over who will gain control of, not just Israel in general, but the rights to Jerusalem in particular! The word \u201cJerusalem\u201d appears 811 times in your King James Bible, think that God places a lot of importance on it? \\n\u201cBehold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.\u201d Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) \\nGod says if you go against His city of Jerusalem that it will mean \u201clights out\u201d for you. Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His \u201cburdensome stone\u201d with which He judges the world. \\n\u201cAnd in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.\u201d Zechariah 12:3 (KJV) NTEB PRESENTS: Donald Trump, Jerusalem and Bible Prophecy \\nWe just launched a YouTube channel for Bible teaching and prophecy, and here is our very first video of our radio show on Donald Trump and Jerusalem. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel by clicking here , thank you! \\nBible believers, let\u2019s be honest. God is not really so much concerned with any election in any nation so much as He is with His nation of Israel and its capital city of Jerusalem. That\u2019s where God\u2019s passion is, that\u2019s where His heart is. Genesis says that if you want God\u2019s blessing, then bless His nation of Israel and bless His chosen people, the Jews. \\n\u201cAnd I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\u201d Genesis 12:3 (KJV) Christian, do you need a reason from the Bible to vote for Donald Trump? \\nI just gave you two, very powerful and very Biblical reasons to vote for Donald Trump. He will move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, and he will love Israel and God will bless us for that. Now, get up, put your \u201cbig boy\u201d and \u201cbig girl\u201d pants on, and go out and vote . \\nNot for the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d as some erroneously assert, but for the only candidate that will fulfill Bible prophecy   \\nDonald J. Trump.'"}, "time": 1742561699.8945744}
