Those who are foreign born, including illegals, are seeing their birthrate drop, though it is still making up for the decline in births by American women. \\nPew\u2019s recently-released report read: \u201cIn 2014, about 275,000 babies were born to unauthorized-immigrant parents in the U.S., accounting for about 7 percent of all U.S. births, and 32 percent of all U.S. births to foreign-born mothers.\u201d The share of new mothers who are teenagers is higher among the U.S. born (6%) than among the foreign born (2%) https://t.co/d6f9C9ALoR pic.twitter.com/ydJpV2NgXh \\n\u2014 Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) October 26, 2016 \\n\u201cA third of all births to foreign-born mothers were to unmarried women \u2013 down from a peak of 37 percent in 2008. At the same time, the rate has held steady for U.S.-born women and now stands at 42 percent,\u201d the study continued. \\nAccording to Pew, the birthrate among U.S.-born women has declined, so the rise in the birthrate is solely because of immigrant mothers. The growth in annual U.S. births since 1970 has been driven entirely by immigrant moms https://t.co/bhzGRzgimg pic.twitter.com/dozNVXXVgT \\n\u2014 Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) October 26, 2016 \\nWhile the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent years \u2013 most markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births nationwide \u2013 the trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970. \\nThis growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014. \\nSo, do you think that all these people coming here, in many cases illegally, have assimilated to our culture and/or are planning on doing so? Take a look around and it\u2019s easy to see that the answer is no. \\nIf Hillary Clinton is elected, she plans to greatly increase refugee flows and give amnesty to illegal immigrants who broke our laws. In contrast, Donald Trump has pledged to restore law and order, build a wall, enforce immigration laws, and put the safety and interests of American citizens first. \\nWhich one sounds better to you at this critical point in our country\u2019s history?'"}, "time": 1742628502.3992565}
