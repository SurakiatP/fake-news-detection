Her astonishing debut novel, \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d (2000) recounted the story of two World War II vets  \u2014   polar opposites and best friends  \u2014   and their extended families, opening out into a teeming,   portrait of a multicultural London. \u201cOn Beauty\u201d (2005) another magical   novel (set mainly in Boston) also depicted two very different families with intertwined lives. And the disappointing \u201cNW\u201d (2012) used the diverging stories of two childhood friends to look at the potent and ever shifting dynamics of money and class. Ms. Smith\u2019s latest novel, \u201cSwing Time,\u201d works a variation on this setup. This time, it\u2019s two spirited London girls and their very different trajectories. There are echoes of Wendy Wasserstein\u2019s captivating 1981 play, \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic\u201d  \u2014   in their titles, lifted from 1930s classics in film and song, and in their portraits of two friends\u2019 coming of age and their conflicted relationships with their mothers. At the same time, this novel addresses many themes that have animated Ms. Smith\u2019s work since the start: the competing claims that family, cultural heritage and politics exert on identity how personal imperatives are shaped (or not) by public events the mix of emulation, resentment and rebellion that inform children\u2019s attitudes toward their parents. Told in the first person, the narrative cuts back and forth in time, alternating between persuasive chapters about the unnamed narrator\u2019s memories of her childhood and adolescence (when she and her friend Tracey both aspired to become dancers) and dull, strangely generic chapters about her   experiences, working as an assistant to a famous singer and   humanitarian named Aimee, who can \u201cprocure a baby\u201d for adoption \u201cas easily as she might order a   handbag from Japan. \u201d The novel\u2019s flashback chapters, set in London, possess the tactile energy and emotional detail of \u201cWhite Teeth. \u201d Ms. Smith conjures the electric pulse of the 1980s and 1990s, when goth and punk were taking over the streets, and the nostalgia of the Cool Britannia years, when people rode Vespas to work and decorated their cubicles with pictures of Michael Caine in \u201cAlfie\u201d  \u2014   the boys looking like \u201crebooted Mods\u201d with \u201cKinks haircuts from 30 years earlier,\u201d the girls like \u201cJulie Christie   in short skirts with smudgy black eyes. \u201d She also captures the   rituals of that era before smartphones and the internet transformed daily life  \u2014   when email was still a rarity, and research was conducted not through Google, but in libraries, reading old newspapers and microfiche. She is more adept here than in \u201cNW\u201d at mapping the inner lives of her heroines, though the radical sympathy she evinced for her characters in \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d and \u201cOn Beauty\u201d has given way to a somewhat more grudging attitude  \u2014   perhaps accounted for by the fact that the story is told from the narrator\u2019s decidedly subjective point of view. Ms. Smith conveys her heroines\u2019 youthful passion for dance  \u2014   a calling that only Tracey has the talent to seriously pursue  \u2014   and the   of their   friendship. Tracey  \u2014   whose absent father has been in jail, and whose angry mother is an enabler of Tracey\u2019s worst impulses  \u2014   is the diva, the heedless one, who wears flashy clothes, has lots of boyfriends and takes a lot of drugs. The narrator is the good girl, the   prudent one, who plays Ethel to Tracey\u2019s flamboyant Lucy. Eager to escape the shadow of her chilly, politically ambitious mother, the narrator goes off to college, and eventually takes a job that requires her to play Ethel to Aimee\u2019s Lucy. Aimee is a complete celebrity stereotype  \u2014   a rote   of Madonna and Angelina Jolie, who possesses none of the satiric edge or surprising tenderness of, say, the Justin   hero of Teddy Wayne\u2019s 2013 novel, \u201cThe Love Song of Jonny Valentine. \u201d And the chapters that chronicle Aimee\u2019s much publicized efforts to build a school in an unnamed African country are beyond tedious  \u2014   Aimee jetting in from her cosseted life in Britain and America to visit a village and meet with children and politicians, all the while trailed by video cameras. These sections are so perfunctorily rendered that they often feel like stuffing, written to fill out the novel\u2019s schematic structure, which moves between     sections, and flashback,   ones. Some of the narrator\u2019s experiences in Africa with Aimee  \u2014   combined with her efforts to understand shifting attitudes toward race in music and dance  \u2014   are meant to raise larger questions about cultural appropriation, and the relationship between the privileged West and the developing world. But these issues do not spring organically from this clumsy novel  \u2014   a novel that showcases its author\u2019s formidable talents in only half its pages, while bogging down the rest of the time in formulaic and predictable storytelling.'"}, "time": 1742561851.4806645}
