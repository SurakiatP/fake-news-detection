Mateen, the murderer behind the brutal June killing of 49 nightclub goers in Orlando, Florida, had called 911 amid the massacre, and negotiators then called the killer several times throughout the evening.\\nAt the time of the transcript\u2019s release, the public denounced the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) for censoring the Orlando shooter\u2019s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS). Claiming the omission was meant to ensure would-be terrorists wouldn\u2019t have a \u201cpublicity platform,\u201d officials added the transcripts had distracted the public from \u201c the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime .\u201d\\nBut when the FBI released the full transcripts in September, the documents offered us a closer look into the motives behind Mateen\u2019s actions, which had also been confirmed by one of the hostages. Unfortunately, few pundits dared to bring that information up on primetime television.\\nNow that the full audio recordings of the calls between the shooter and 911 dispatchers have been made public , Mateen\u2019s comments regarding U.S. military interventions abroad are being brought up again.\\nThe audio recordings were released following an order from Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber. Orlando city attorney Darryl Bloodworth recently promised the city would no longer keep the tapes under wraps, which prompted the judge\u2019s order. The city had been the number one obstacle between journalists and the tapes, claiming their release would \u201c be a violation of a Florida law that makes photographs, videos or audio recordings showing \u2018the killing of a person\u2019 exempt from disclosure, available only to family members .\u201d\\nIn one of the released calls, Mateen can be heard insisting the police negotiator tell \u201c the US government to stop bombing,\u201d and when the negotiator asks Mateen to tell him where he is, he answers , \u201c No, because you have to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq .\u201d\\nThe U.S. government, Mateen continues , \u201c [is] killing too many children, they are killing too many women, OK? \u2026 So what am I to do here, when my people are getting killed over there? You get what I\u2019m saying? \u201d When asked about \u201cwhat is going on tonight,\u201d Mateen adds :\\n\u201c What\u2019s going on is that I feel the pain of the people getting killed in Syria and Iraq and all over the Muslim [unidentified word] .\u201d\\nAs Mateen is pressed to give the negotiator more information, he becomes more hostile and hangs up repeatedly. Asked for his name, Mateen responds with the following:\\n\u201c You\u2019re speaking with the person who pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \u201d\\nAt one point during the conversation, Mateen asks the negotiator to call him \u201c Mujahedeen, call me the Soldier of God. \u201d\\nWhile several calls were made, Mateen resisted giving the negotiator any further information, repeatedly referring to the U.S. bombings of Iraq and Syria and even going as far as to accuse the United States of collaborating with Russia, \u201c and \u2026 killing innocent women and children .\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn June 12, 5 a.m., Orlando police and Orange County deputies entered Pulse nightclub and killed Mateen in a shootout . The audio released by the city is one of over 200 other phone calls made to 911 during the shooting. These recordings remain under review by Judge Schreiber, TC Palm reported .
