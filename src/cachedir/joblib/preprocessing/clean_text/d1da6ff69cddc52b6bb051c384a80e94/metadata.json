She lost that state \u2013 and its ten Electoral College votes \u2013 by 27,000.\\nMichigan was too close to call with a gap of 11,000, denying Clinton its 16 Electoral College votes, and she lost Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 Electoral College votes by 68,236.\\nThough there\u2019s been no suggestion of possible culprits in the potential hacking, the DNC blamed Russia for mid-election-season hacks of Democrat email accounts.\\nIf an independent investigation could prove hacking \u2013 and a recount granted Clinton those three states \u2013 then she would be made President after all.\\nFull Report: The Daily Mail \\nAhead of the election unnamed sources in the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities spoke to the mainstream media and warned that, while the electronic voting machines used to register a candidate were completely safe, Russia could try to undermine U.S. elections by releasing fraudulent documentation showing that the election was hacked. As we reported at the time :\\nAccording to Reuters, U.S. voting authorities are now warning that while the Russians may not actually hack the Presidential election, they may fake hacking the Presidential election .\\nWhat they\u2019re saying without actually saying it is that if Hillary Clinton wins the election and Trump supporters show proof of any fraudulent activity, the \u201cproof\u201d will have been fabricated\\nIt sounds almost too crazy to believe, but this is now being disseminated to the public via mainstream pipelines:\\n\u2026.\\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia\u2019s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. \\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. \\nBut hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.

The \u201cexperts\u201d say our voting systems were, in fact, compromised by hackers and they were able to change the outcome of the election in favor of Donald Trump.\\nSo who do we believe? The experts, who claim they have evidence of voter fraud?
