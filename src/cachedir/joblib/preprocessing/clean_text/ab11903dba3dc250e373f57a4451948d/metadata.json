Trump of waging  a \u201cpermanent campaign. \u201d[In a February 17 article, NPR\u2019s Ron Elving claimed that the American people are tired of presidential campaigns that last too long, but \u201cNow, they are confronted with one that refuses to end  \u2014   even after reaching the White House. \u201d  Elving\u2019s attack on Trump came in response to the President\u2019s often combative February 15 press conference that the NPR Washington correspondent described with a simple \u201cWow. \u201d After noting the criticism of the presser published by various news outlets, Elving then complained that Trump used \u201cI\u201d or \u201cme\u201d or \u201cthe royal we\u201d too often during his presentation. The NPR staffer then went on to say, \u201cThe president often seemed to be responding in the manner of a candidate. \u201d He added, \u201cThe campaign mode continues this weekend, with the president again rallying like it\u2019s 2016. \u201d Elving suggested that Trump might be being using this \u201cpermanent campaign\u201d as a tactic to keep his policy ideas at the front of the political discussion. \u201cOr perhaps the campaign continues because it continues,\u201d Elving said as he wrapped up. \u201cThe president does not yet seem comfortable in his new office with all the crosswinds and complications of divided powers and shared responsibilities. \u201d Perhaps Elving has been in a coma since 2007, when Obama launched a campaign for president that didn\u2019t end until he left office on January 20, 2017. Obama spent eight years being hit with charges that he never stopped campaigning, It was one of the most common criticisms of the Obama presidency. In fact, Obama kept his campaign apparatus, Organizing for America, in operation even after what he claimed would be his \u201clast election. \u201d In December of 2012, for instance, The Observer remarked that OFA was still soliciting contributions months after Obama won his second term. Indeed, OFA is up and running today, aiming to undermine Donald Trump  \u2014   and many are making note of it. Obama continues to issue tweets using the OFA Twitter account, and gives marching orders to his OFA army, even in reputed retirement. In August of 2009, former George W. Bush political advisor Karl Rove charged that Obama was continuing to use \u201cdivisive,\u201d and \u201cpermanent campaign tactics\u201d despite easily winning his election. The Washington Times observed the same thing. The claim was not made only by disgruntled conservatives or   news sources, either. In 2013 The New York Times wrote that Obama\u2019s \u201ccampaign without end\u201d was fundraising in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d manner. Before that, the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank commented on the issue in May of 2012, saying that Obama had \u201cembraced the permanent campaign\u201d and was flying all across the country leading   rallies to push his agenda. \u201cTo a greater extent than his predecessors, Obama has used the trappings of his office to promote his reelection prospects even while handling   business,\u201d Milbank wrote. In addition, several   websites and commentators actually celebrated Obama for using campaign tactics to continue to sell his ideas. MSNBC praised Obama for \u201cputting the permanent campaign to good use,\u201d and The Atlantic marveled that Obama\u2019s \u201cpermanent campaign\u201d was using his \u201creelection playbook to change Washington. \u201d With all this, it is interesting that today NPR\u2019s Ron Elving seems to have only just noticed that a president is perpetrating a \u201cpermanent campaign\u201d to keep his policies on track to completion. Finally, it was rather tone deaf for Elving to criticize Donald Trump for using \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d too much, coming off the last eight years of a president famous for his narcissistic references to himself in every appearance. Despite mocking the penchant of the   press for keeping count of his   habits, The Washington Post recently published a piece noting just how often Obama talked about himself. After all, Barack Obama was the president so enthralled with himself that he gave the Queen of England the dubious gift of an iPod filled with Barack Obama speeches.
