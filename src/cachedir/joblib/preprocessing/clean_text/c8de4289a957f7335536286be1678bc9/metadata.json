So that is a good thing; it shows that the people finally woke up. They understood that a lot was at risk. They were not being served by the government \u2013 and the fact that they realized this. They are not as insouciant as they have been. They are more aware. They were determined; they were not influenced by the propaganda against Trump. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s good, and this will stay. I think this will be permanent.\\nNow if Trump pulls and Obama and sells them out, the question is will they get demoralized and give up, or do they get more angry and the next time we see a bloody revolution. You know, sometimes, when you had so much corruption \u2013 in the United States, every institution is totally corrupt, everyone. The oligarchy have corrupted everything. When you get so much corruption, sometimes you can\u2019t have a change without bloodshed. People have to die. \\nRichie Allen: \u201cAnd you\u2019re a pacifist.\u201d\\nRoberts: \u201cOur founding fathers were aware of this. Thomas Jefferson was explicit about it. So what we may see if Trump is blocked or he gives up or nothing can happen, people they could just give up or they could just get angry.\u201d \\nWhy? Because people are fed up with the establishment, hungry for change and too desperate to ignore the crisis they are in.\\nThe economic situation alone has driven the masses to the edge. Without a decent standard of living and a secure place in or near the middle class, things are going to be unstable and ripe for a volatile chemical reaction .\\nAlthough Paul Craig Roberts statements seem alarming, they are in line with everything that has been happening economically, and secondarily politically, for the past several cycles and through the entire Obama presidency.\\nWatch the full interview via The Richie Allen Show :\\nPaul Craig Roberts \u201cThe People Spoke But We\u2019ll Have Violent Revolution\\nIf Trump Lets Them Down!\u201d \\n\\nHistory proves that things are teetering towards revolution, and if a President Trump doesn\u2019t offer satisfaction, then people may very likely turn towards their only remaining alternative. Allen : \u201cSo we could see more than civil disobedience, we could see violence.\u201d\\nRoberts : \u201cI think it only could be violence, because if you try to do civil disobedience, you\u2019re individually acting and you have no protection, but violence requires large numbers and there\u2019s protection in numbers. If I tell them, \u2018I\u2019m not having anything to do with you, I\u2019m not paying my taxes,\u2019 they\u2019ll just come pick me up. But there\u2019s tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions saying, \u2018Screw you, we\u2019re going to kill you\u2019, you can\u2019t pick them up.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd so, I think that if \u2013 you see, look, Richie, everyone needs to understand this. The living standards of the average American have collapsed. All this b.s. about America being rich, and they\u2019re always so wonderful and the streets are paved with gold, but it\u2019s all B.S. For 20, 30 years the living standards have been collapsing \u2013 since the Clinton regime. Collapsing. We have half of the 25 year old Americans living at home with their parents because they cannot get employment that lets them have an independent existence. They cannot pay their rent. We have huge numbers of university graduates suffocated by student loans. They can\u2019t get jobs that let them pay the loans off. We have more people aged 24 through 34 years of age living at home with their parents than living independently.\u201d\\n\u201cThere are no good jobs created. The jobs reports, to the extent that they aren\u2019t just fabricated, they are part-time, low-pay jobs without any benefits. No pension. No health benefits. They country, the people are being destroyed. The retired people have had no interest income on their savings for eight years \u2013 they\u2019re having to draw down the money they expected to produce an income to see them through their retirement. People are suffering. They can\u2019t buy houses \u2013 if you can\u2019t form a household, you can\u2019t buy a house. You can\u2019t buy home furnishings, appliances.\u201d\\n\u201cThe whole economy is hurt. So it\u2019s a really serious economic situation. The domestic market is almost non-existent; it can\u2019t grow because there\u2019s no income growth for anybody except the 1% \u2013 and there\u2019s a limit to how much the 1% can consume. So the economic situation is very bad. There\u2019s debt everywhere. Individuals don\u2019t have any discretionary income \u2013 except for a very few. And so that type of situation, if it worsens, at some point people say \u2018I can\u2019t survive\u2026 I\u2019ve nothing to lose\u2019. [\u2026] This is a situation here. We\u2019re talking about the United States is degenerating into a third world country.\u201d\\nThis is not just a question of Trump\u2019s performance, qualifications or ego in office.\\nThis is a systematic problem that spans decades of the American history. The Clintons and Bushes are symptoms of that problem, and the system underestimated the intense angry and dissatisfaction against those entrenched oligarchs and elites.\\nHowever, as Paul Craig Roberts makes clear earlier in his interview here , Trump faces a significant threat of being undermined by his \u201cadvisors,\u201d staff, cabinet appointments and so forth, particularly if they are loyal to the establishment, as nearly every \u2018experienced\u2019 individual in these positions seems to be.\\nNeocons and the like could swiftly pervert yet another \u201cchange\u201d administration into an establishment cover operation for the continuity of their control system. Indeed, even with the best of intentions, Trump faces an uphill battle at overturning the status quo. Indeed, the system may well be plotting to unleash a new wave of economic decline that they can blame him for, and break the dam of unrest that has been swelling.\\nThe larger storm is still brewing. Roberts argued in his column, \u2018 The working class won the election \u2018 that:\\nThe US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people. \\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran.\\nIt also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump\u2019s victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury.\\n[\u2026] We won\u2019t know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured.\\n[\u2026] If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed. \\nThe post-election riots against Trump, the Black Lives Matter protests that have pitted police against inner-city people of color and the quieter exercises for martial law and the containment of a domestic uprising all prove that the elite understand what is coming, and while they may have no way to stop it altogether, they may succeed in steering it into meaningless fights and divisions which they can use as a buffer.\\nEconomic devastation and the collapse of the system means that literally tens of millions of people will have nothing left to lose , and nothing better to turn to than mob revolt.\\nBeware of what\u2019s coming, prepare for long periods of instability and roaming violence, and pray that the system corrects for the benefit of the people of this country once again.\\nRead more: \\n\\n\u201cThe Second American Revolution Is Happening\u201d \u2013 U.S. Intelligence Agencies Have Started A Counter Coup Against Clinton \\n\u201cIt Is Really Hard To Argue With Trump About This\u201d: Face It, America Is In Decline \\n\u201cRevolt of the Elites\u201d: Society Is Divided, Self-Absorbed and Powerless to Stop Them \\nTriggers For Revolt: Rising Resource Costs Escalate Odds of Global Unrest \\nWho Are The \u201cDeplorables\u201d And Why Do They Refuse To Be Trampled Upon? \\n'"}, "time": 1742562087.8153791}
