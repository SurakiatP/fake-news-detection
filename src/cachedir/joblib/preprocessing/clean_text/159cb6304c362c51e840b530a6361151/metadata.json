Ambassador John Bolton spoke to Breitbart News Daily on Thursday about speculation that President Trump will delay his decision to relocate the U. S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem but announce America\u2019s exit from the Paris climate accords. [\u201cI don\u2019t really know one way or the other,\u201d Bolton confessed. \u201cI wish they would move the embassy to Jerusalem. I suspect if they were going to that in the near term, they would have announced it on the president\u2019s trip to the region  \u2014   which was very successful in both its Saudi component and its Israel component. \u201d  Bolton noted that on the same day the White House is expected to announce the Jerusalem decision, it is also expected to announce withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, a combination he described as \u201ca kind of good   news strategy. \u201d \u201cI have my fingers crossed that the president will get out of the Paris accords today. We\u2019ll wait and see what happens on that, too,\u201d he said. SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked why so many American leaders talk about moving the embassy to Jerusalem but never actually do it. Bolton replied that while there is \u201cstrong feeling about moving the embassy\u201d among the general public not just among Jewish Americans, but also among dedicated Christian supporters of Israel, American politicians were given pause by the potential political fallout. He suggested that on the contrary, they should see moving the embassy as a domestic political winner. Another reason the embassy does not get moved is the U. S. State Department\u2019s view that \u201cthe status of Jerusalem is a matter for the final negotiations in the creation of a Palestinian state. \u201d \u201cTherefore, the argument goes, if you do anything to prejudice the outcome of the final status negotiations, you could blow the whole thing up,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is utter nonsense,\u201d he argued. \u201cNumber one, the whole premise  \u2014   that is to say, a   solution where a new Palestinian state is created, which we\u2019ve been at now for more than 70 years  \u2014   has proven to be a complete failure. If that\u2019s the premise for the argument about final status, we can dispense with that pretty quickly. \u201d \u201cI think, even more importantly, just as a practical matter, no one has ever suggested that the U. S. embassy, if it were moved to Jerusalem, would be put in East Jerusalem, which is what the Palestinians claim would be their capital,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere has been space made available by the government of Israel in West Jerusalem, west of the \u2018green line,\u2019 in territory no one has ever in their wildest dreams claimed would be part of a new Palestinian state. So erecting a U. S embassy there could not conceivably prejudice the final outcome. \u201d \u201cAnd then there\u2019s another reason,\u201d he added. \u201cI think when the U. S. decides to have diplomatic relations with a country, it\u2019s between the U. S. and that country alone to determine how they are going to conduct relations. I view this as an analog to dealing with Taiwan, where the mainland Chinese are constantly trying to tell the United States how to behave, and unfortunately, we respond. We don\u2019t allow Taiwanese diplomats into the State Department, if you can believe it, because we don\u2019t want to offend Beijing. I think it\u2019s time for the United States to say, \u2018You know, we\u2019re going to conduct U. S. diplomatic relations the way we want, period.\u2019 If that means putting the embassy in Jerusalem, let\u2019s do it. \u201d Bolton shared Kassam\u2019s dim view of the \u201chysteria emanating from Europeans\u201d after President Trump\u2019s overseas trip. He noted that the U. S. Embassy in Berlin issued an assessment that German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s negative comments about President Trump were intended to influence domestic politics. \u201cIn other words, this does not rise to the cosmic level of affecting the   alliance,\u201d Bolton elaborated. \u201cI remember very well at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, the Europeans were saying much the same thing: \u2018Oh, my God, the United States is going to create a national missile defense system! They\u2019re going to hide behind it! They\u2019re going to go isolation again! They\u2019re going to leave us poor Europeans out here to defend ourselves! \u2019\u201d \u201cAnd then President Bush withdrew from the 1972   Missile Treaty so we could create a national defense,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe did withdraw from the International Criminal Court treaty, we unsigned it. We did get out of a hopeless negotiation over an utterly unworkable biological weapons verification protocol. The only thing really we didn\u2019t wrap up was we didn\u2019t unsign the Kyoto Protocol, which we should have done. \u201d \u201cMy point is, it was the same wailing and gnashing of teeth by the Europeans about the end of the   alliance, the decline of American leadership. It wasn\u2019t true then. It\u2019s not true now,\u201d said Bolton. He sized up the Paris climate accord as \u201can excellent thing to withdraw from. \u201d \u201cIn fundamental terms, it\u2019s basically an utterly meaningless document,\u201d he noted. \u201cEach country involved sets its own targets and then declares its own progress. The world\u2019s two biggest polluters, India and China, don\u2019t even have to begin reducing carbon emissions until 2030. The Europeans have the math rigged in their favor. \u201d  \u201cThe whole thing is a charade, except to this extent: even in effect as toothless as it is, what the Europeans and the Obama administration did when they negotiated the Paris accord was try to take a step forward toward formalizing this global governance structure that they had tried and failed, in the predecessor Kyoto agreement and the predecessor Copenhagen agreement,\u201d Bolton charged.  \u201cEven though it appears toothless in the near term, it sets a foundation that they hope to advance toward a greater multilateral global governance. Forget the environmental aspect for a minute  \u2014   we could be talking about global cooling here, rather than global warming. The advocates of this treaty would propose the same kinds of structures because that\u2019s their larger objective: the reduction of national sovereignty and the pooling of sovereignty as in their favorite institution, their paradigm of the world to come, the European Union,\u201d he warned. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for the United States to say, \u2018If you people want to pool sovereignty and reduce your democratic control over governments, which is a very widespread view regarding Brussels and the European Union now, you go right ahead. We\u2019re not going to play any part of it,\u2019\u201d Bolton advised. Kassam amplified Bolton\u2019s point about individual countries playing games with their Paris emission targets by recalling how the French themselves dealt with high   emission targets by simply moving the sensors onto rooftops. \u201cYou gotta love the French!\u201d Bolton chuckled. \u201cWhen they invented the word \u2018hypocrisy,\u2019 it came from Paris, and they are great at it, God bless \u2019em. \u201d John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.
