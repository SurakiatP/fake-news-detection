Now that nearly every airline is charging baggage fees, travelers are motivated to pack as efficiently as possible. And who knows more about packing than professional flight crews? In interviews with a dozen flight attendants and pilots, one theme emerged: to pare down and still have everything needed at the destination, think strategically. Where you\u2019re going and what you\u2019ll do there should guide packing, but it is most important to know your absolute essentials. \u201cI try to pack everything I\u2019ll need to survive,\u201d said Leigh Johnson, a retired American Airlines captain. The ability to wash shirts and underwear is important to him, so Mr. Johnson brings laundry soap. And because he often arrives at the airport for a flight before the restaurants open, he packs food. \u201cI\u2019m not wasting my hour of preflight looking for something to eat,\u201d he said, explaining that he seals bananas, bread and plastic containers of olive oil in plastic bags and tucks them inside his packed shoes. A surprising number of pilots and flight attendants say they always carry food. \u201cMore flight attendants carry food than don\u2019t,\u201d said Heather Poole, a flight attendant and travel blogger at www. heatherpoole. com. Professional travelers also pack personal electronics like   readers and laptops. Patrick Smith, an airline pilot who writes the Salon column Ask the Pilot, often brings a camera so he can post his travel videos online. \u201cI have a   relationship with my electronic gadgets,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cOn one hand, they are eminently useful. On the other hand, I resent the amount of hardware that I\u2019m forced to carry, and I particularly resent the fact that every gadget has its own proprietary recharging device. \u201d To make room for these new travel necessities, many flight attendants roll their clothes rather than fold them to save space. Nerea   an attendant with Air Europa L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas in Majorca, Spain, has taught friends and relatives to   clothes. \u201cThe    tip is the basis of my entire company,\u201d said Don Chernoff, an engineer and frequent traveler, whose www. skyroll. com offers a line of luggage that encourages rolling rather than folding. \u201cIt\u2019s a more efficient use of the space. \u201d Weather and terrain create the biggest packing challenges. Coats, hats and umbrellas are cumbersome. Jay Abramson, a captain with Continental Airlines, avoids bringing heavy garments even in winter. \u201cA thermal   and long underwear will allow you to wear a sweater and a fleece or lined windbreaker down to the   degrees,\u201d he said. If Sara Keagle, a flight attendant, can\u2019t get by with the coat her airline issued, she\u2019ll pack several   sweaters and layer them. Fred Arenas, a corporate pilot, travels with just one pair of shoes, the ones on his feet in the cockpit. If you need more, follow the advice of Ms. Poole, the Los Angeles flight attendant. Select shoes, then coordinate outfits around them. Three pairs should be the maximum, she said: \u201cShoes take up so much space. \u201d Mr. Johnson, an avid outdoorsman, wears his hiking boots onto the plane rather than pack them. Pilots are often teased about repurposing the trousers from their uniforms. But minus the   blazer, a pilot\u2019s or flight attendant\u2019s uniform pants in a basic solid color are easy to pair with a shirt or sweater. Mr. Laurie\u2019s   flight attendant uniform is all black. By planning to wear part of his uniform in   he opens space in his bag for something else. Of course, travelers don\u2019t have uniforms, but they can adopt a uniformlike mentality by wearing onto the airplane the blazer or suit they\u2019ll need at their destination. Select garments that travel well. \u201cUsually a   percent   blend combo is best,\u201d Mr. Arenas said. Mr. Smith said: \u201c  apparel isn\u2019t always the most stylish, but it\u2019s lightweight, washable in a hotel room sink and takes up little room. Think REI or Travelsmith. \u201d Another uniformlike concept is   separates that can go together in different ways. Ms. Keagle, who podcasts about flying with Mr. Laurie, said she brings a few basic pieces like black pants that don\u2019t wrinkle and black tops, then packs small accessories like scarves and jewelry. Ms.   takes a similar approach. \u201cI always pack the same clothes because I go with different people they don\u2019t know what I wore the last time,\u201d she said. While deciding between what\u2019s essential and what\u2019s extra is highly personal, Mr. Chernoff, the luggage designer, has advice that\u2019s universal. \u201cThink hard about what you are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cPare down what you are going to bring. Then, when you\u2019re done, pare it down again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563965.2490506}
