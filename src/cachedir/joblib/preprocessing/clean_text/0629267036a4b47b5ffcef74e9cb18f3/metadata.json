The presidential candidates focused on reassuring the public that they are in good health. Donald Trump taped an appearance on the \u201cDr. Oz Show\u201d to be broadcast Thursday, giving a quick   of results from a recent medical exam. He revealed that he weighs 267 pounds, which is considered obese for a man of his height, about 6 foot 2. Hillary Clinton\u2019s doctor said she was recovering well from pneumonia and remained \u201chealthy and fit to serve as president of the United States. \u201d _____ 2. Hackers added another prominent victim: former Secretary of State Colin Powell. His blunt emails fractured the restraint of his public persona, revealing complaints about Mr. Trump (\u201ca national disgrace\u201d) and aides of Mrs. Clinton (for trying to \u201cdrag\u201d him into her own email troubles). There was also antagonism toward other members of the Bush cabinet. Mr. Powell referred to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as \u201cthe idiot Rummy\u201d and former Vice President Dick Cheney as \u201ca spent force. \u201d _____ 3. Our analysts took a deep breath after Tuesday\u2019s heady economic news, notably the fastest rate of U. S. income growth in decades. Sorting through the Census Bureau\u2019s numbers uncovers cautionary notes: The gains for the poorest haven\u2019t offset a decade of lost ground. And households outside of urban areas saw their incomes fall 2 percent  \u2014   one source of the pain driving the   tenor of this elections cycle. _____ 4. President Obama welcomed Myanmar\u2019s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, to the White House and pledged to lift all remaining sanctions against the country as its reward \u201cfor a new way of doing business. \u201d His administration considers her rise from outlawed opposition leader as a triumph of democracy and a validation of the strategy of engagement with former U. S. adversaries. _____ 5. Pittsburgh logged Day 1 of Uber\u2019s   car experiment. A few of the   service\u2019s most loyal users are taking part in the pilot program, operating in a few square miles of the city\u2019s downtown. During our own reporter\u2019s test ride, a safety engineer in the driver\u2019s seat took control of the car several times  \u2014   to avoid speeders or when a truck suddenly backed out in front of them. \u201cPittsburgh,\u201d an Uber officer said, \u201cis the   diamond of driving. \u201d Meanwhile, Tesla Motors was faced with a fatal crash in China that may be the second involving its automated   system. _____ 6. A   study on prostate cancer is finally out. Researchers followed men with prostate cancer for 10 years and found no difference in death rates among those who had surgery, those who had radiation and those who chose to have the cancer monitored regularly and treated only if it progressed. One doctor said the findings helped confirm that monitoring  \u2014   if regular and careful  \u2014   is a valuable approach. _____ 7. Carla Hayden, a veteran of Baltimore\u2019s library system, was sworn in as the 14th librarian of Congress, the nation\u2019s leading repository of knowledge and culture. She is the first woman and the first   to serve in the role. \u201cTo be the head of an institution that\u2019s associated with knowledge and reading and scholarship when slaves were forbidden to learn how to read on punishment of losing limbs, that\u2019s kind of something,\u201d she said. Our   reporting project wants to hear your stories about race and education. We want to hear from parents, teachers and students of    \u2014   12, about how race and diversity are being discussed in schools and at home. _____ 8. Acrimony between Turkey and Europe over the Turkish government\u2019s purges and repressions is fraying their deal to curb the flow of refugees. More than a thousand refugees, including Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis and Iraqis, fled from Turkey to Greece last week. _____ 9. One of our   stories today  \u2014   accompanied by one of our most beautiful photos  \u2014   examines how Russia\u2019s expression of power abroad includes the cross as well as the sword. The Russian Orthodox Church, which is closely allied with the Kremlin, is pushing into Western Europe with Vladimir Putin\u2019s gospel of cultural conservatism. Above, a service for Russians killed in the July 14 terrorist attack at St. Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral in Nice, France. _____ 10. Finally, this is not a jungle gym. It\u2019s a rendering of a    climbing sculpture  under construction on the Far West Side of Manhattan, created by Thomas Heatherwick, a polymathic British designer of sculpture, furniture and Shanghai\u2019s 2010 World Expo. The darling of wealthy philanthropists and businessmen, he is aiming here to galvanize a development project, the Hudson Yards. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
