Rice said unmaking names in intelligence reports she received is standard procedure insisting, \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody,\u201d adding there is \u201cno equivalence\u201d between unmasking and leaking. Rice said, \u201cThe allegation is that somehow Obama Administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes. That is absolutely false. I was the national security advisor. My job is to protect the American people and the security of our country. That\u2019s the same as the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the CIA director, and every morning to enable us to do that, we receive, from the intelligence community, a compilation of intelligence reports that the intelligence community selected for us on a daily basis to give us the best information as to what is going on around the world. I received those reports as did each of the other officials, and there were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U. S. person was referred to. Name not provided, just U. S. person. And sometimes in that context, in order to understand the importance of the report, and assess it\u2019s significance, it was necessary to find out, or request the information as to who the U. S. official was. \u201d She continued, \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would. Let me explain this. First, to talk about the contents of a classified report  \u2014   to talk about the individuals on the foreign side, who were the targets of the report itself, or any Americans that may have collected upon incidentally is to disclose classified information I\u2019m not going to do that. Those people putting these stories out are doing just that. I can\u2019t describe any particular report, and I have no idea what re reports  \u2014   I don\u2019t know the time frame, the subject matter, and I don\u2019t know who they think was collected upon. \u201d She added, \u201cWhen the intelligence community would respond to a request to identify an American, that would come back only to the person requested it, brought back to them directly. To me, or to whoever might have requested it, on occasion, and this is important. It was not then typically broadly disseminated throughout the nation security community or the government. So the notion that some people are trying to suggest that by asking for the identity of an American person, that is the same as leaking it is completely false. There is no equivalence between   unmasking and leaking. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563909.4426699}
