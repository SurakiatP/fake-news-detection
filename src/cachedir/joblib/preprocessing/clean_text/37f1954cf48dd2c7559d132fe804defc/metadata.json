[Chesler was slated to appear as a part of a conference at the University of Arkansas Law School\u2019s King Fahd Center for Middle East Studies on honor killings, but was ultimately disinvited after concerns arose over Chesler\u2019s alleged \u201cIslamophobia. \u201d  Three professors that work at the King Fahd Center for Middle East Studies wrote a letter denouncing Chesler. In the letter, which was addressed to King Fahd Center Director Thomas Paradise, Professors Joel Gordon, Ted Swedenburg, and Mohja Kahf called Chesler a \u201cbigot\u201d and a \u201cprominent Islamophobe\u201d for her commentary on Islam. They expressed concerns that Chesler had her writings published by Breitbart News. Dear Tom: It has come to our attention that MEST is   Phyllis Chesler to lecture via Skype at the University of Arkansas Law School\u2019s symposium about honor killings on 14 April 2017. Chesler\u2019s writings frequently feature on the   Breitbart forum as well as many other   platforms. They continued, claiming that Chesler\u2019s perspective on Islam would violate the school\u2019s mission to educate students on the Middle East. \u201cOur work is to educate students on the Middle East, not to promote bigotry,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhile we welcome respectful debate and diverse opinions, we believe that bigotry should not be promoted on this campus. \u201d Chesler was ultimately disinvited in response to the criticisms. You can read the letter in its entirety below: Dear Tom: It has come to our attention that MEST is   Phyllis Chesler to lecture via Skype at the University of Arkansas Law School\u2019s symposium about honor killings on 14 April 2017. Chesler\u2019s writings frequently feature on the   Breitbart forum as well as many other   platforms. One disturbing example is the pamphlet, The Violent Oppression of Women in Islam, that Chesler   in 2007 with Robert Spencer, director of Jihad Watch, who is is considered by the Southern Poverty Law Center to be \u201cone of America\u2019s most prolific and vociferous   propagandists. \u201d The pamphlet was published by David Horowitz\u2019 Freedom Center, which frequently targets students and scholars for speaking out about justice for Palestinians. The pamphlet is a catalogue of horrors inflicted on women that are said to be the outcome of Islam\u2019s essential nature. \u201cIslamic gender apartheid,\u201d Chesler and Spencer write, \u201cis not caused by western imperialism, colonialism, or racism. It is indigenous to Islam both theologically and historically. \u201d Retaliation is obligatory against anyone who kills a human being purely intentionally and without right, [except when] a father or mother (or their fathers or mothers) for killing their offspring, or offspring\u2019s offspring\u201d (section o1. ). Chesler has also said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, yes, the Muslims are against everyone who is not a Muslim. [  \u2026    ] The West, and that means Jews and Israelis, would like to lead sweet and peaceful lives. We\u2019re up against an enemy now that is dying to kill us, that lives to kill, and that at best merely wishes to impose on the rest of us its laws and strictures. \u201d (Fern Sidman, \u201cIsrael Today  Always: Breaking Ranks  \u2014   An Interview With Phyllis Chesler,\u201d The Jewish Press, August 15, 2007) Our work is to educate students on the Middle East, not to promote bigotry. The Executive Travel Order of February 2017 (which we all know is a xenophobic, Islamophobic, travesty of justice) specifically mentions   as a means of differentiating Muslims and in so doing, it capitalizes on fear of Muslims, Honor killings are part of rape culture. Any manifestation of rape culture in any society, including the U. S. is reprehensible. Condemning rape culture and honor killings must not be tainted with bigotry and Islamophobia. While we welcome respectful debate and diverse opinions, we believe that bigotry should not be promoted on this campus. Our program in particular has the responsibility not to be the sponsor of an event featuring a prominent Islamophobe. Sponsoring an event with Chesler on the program sends the opposite message to our students. Sponsoring such a speaker also contributes to an unsafe environment for students on our campus already at risk for   violence. We have asked that MEST provide, via Skype, a qualified speaker to follow Chesler\u2019s remarks. This was deemed not feasible. We ask that MEST publicly withdraw its sponsorship from this symposium. We ask that MEST provide copies of the Islamophobia Is Racism syllabus, created by a collective of academics inspired by the Ferguson syllabus, for distribution at the symposium. We ask that MEST release a statement condemning Islamophobia and bigotry, and affirming its commitment to gender justice and diversity, and that this statement be read at the symposium.
