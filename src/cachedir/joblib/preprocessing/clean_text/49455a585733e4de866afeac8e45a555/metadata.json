Petrovskiy answered that according to the advice of his lawyer, Nils Christian Nordhus, he doesn\u2019t keep the passport in his apartment, and he will talk with his lawyer before giving an answer concerning his departure. \\nAfter this Petrovskiy attempted to call his lawyer while the police were waiting, but because his lawyer didn\u2019t pick it up, the police decided to arrest Petrovskiy and search B\u00e5rdsen\u2019s apartment.
