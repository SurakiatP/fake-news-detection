Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d when none exist \u2013 supported by Washington, NATO , Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey. They\u2019re massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities. Why does it pretend \u201cmoderate\u201d fighters are involved when none exist? Why does it insist on separating nonexistent \u201cmoderates\u201d from terrorist groups it\u2019s combating when all anti-government forces are the same? Why isn\u2019t it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed? It\u2019s the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing \u2013 supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones. Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a so-called humanitarian pause \u2013 a major blunder, accomplishing nothing? Ongoing since October 18, it\u2019s letting US-supported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected. Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because US-supported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded. Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces it\u2019s sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand? It gets worse. On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statement: \u201cThe Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10-km (six-mile) zone around Aleppo.\u201d \u201cSix humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.\u201d \u201cRussia and the Syrian government are ready to resume \u2018humanitarian pauses\u2019 in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebel-held areas.\u201d Fact: Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support. Fact: What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try. Fact: International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo \u2013 or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their \u201cguarantees\u201d if made? Fact: As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution \u2013 a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies can\u2019t imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness. A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor. According to one now free, their relatives were seized, imprisoned and tortured. The only way to liberate thousands of others is by relentlessly smashing their terrorist captors, eliminating them \u2013 not giving them breathing room to mobilize for greater attacks. Washington is delighted with Moscow\u2019s ceasefire and humanitarian pause, serving US imperial interests, State Department spokesman admiral John Kirby saying: \u201cWe welcome the stated intention to extend this pause, and we hope that this extension will be more successful\u2026than it has been thus far\u201d \u2013 meaning the longer it continues, the greater the benefit to US-led dark forces, the worse off trapped Syrians in eastern Aleppo will be, the longer the struggle to liberate Syria will go on.
