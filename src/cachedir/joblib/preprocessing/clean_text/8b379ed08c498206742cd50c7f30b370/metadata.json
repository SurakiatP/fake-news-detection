Pence reiterated the administration\u2019s goal to advance Catholic causes, such as religious freedom and protecting the unborn. [\u201cI had the honor to stand by President Trump as he signed an executive order to restore religious liberty in the public square,\u201d Vice President Pence said to a standing ovation.  \u201cThis administration hears you. This administration stands with you,\u201d he continued. \u201cRemember to bow the head and bend the knee to pray in these challenging times. Not so much pray for a cause but as for our country. \u201d Pence\u2019s remarks were well received by those attending and speaking. \u201cI was very encouraged to hear the vice president, to express his faith overtly and to exhort us here to pray for our country,\u201d former Ambassador to the Vatican R. James Nicholson told Breitbart News. \u201cNobody knows President Trump better than Vice President Pence, and when he affirms the president\u2019s commitment to the sanctity of life, it\u2019s very encouraging. \u201d \u201cThe vice president is sending the right message in the right moment. Unity is important, and it is promoted by faith. Embracing God, we will be one nation,\u201d said Mario E. Dorsonville, the auxiliary bishop of Washington and the event\u2019s invocation speaker. One attendee, Kevin Francis, voiced the overall attitude of the gathering, emphasizing that \u201cit\u2019s very encouraging that [Pence is] supportive of the sanctity of life and religious freedom, which is fundamental to not just being an American but being a person as well. In fact, I think that religious freedom is one\u2019s most fundamental right. With that in mind, it\u2019s also important that [Pence] expressed solidarity with all persecuted religious minorities everywhere, including imperiled Christians in Iraq and Syria. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562344.0859656}
