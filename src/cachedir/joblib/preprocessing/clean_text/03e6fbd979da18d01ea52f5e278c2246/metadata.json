He said Syrians today had the most urgent need for protection. \u201cI strongly hope that the U. S. will be able to   its very solid refugee protection in resettlement and I hope that the Syrians will not be excluded in that process,\u201d Mr. Guterres told reporters at the United Nations headquarters. The secretary general stopped short of calling Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order illegal under international law. But asked whether it violates international obligations, he said: \u201cI think that those measures indeed violate our basic principles. And I think that they are not effective if the objective is to really avoid terrorists to enter the United States. \u201d Mr. Guterres is under enormous pressure. On the one hand, he must speak out against discrimination, in keeping with the rules enshrined in international conventions. On the other, he needs to avoid alienating the president of the United States, which is the United Nations\u2019 biggest financial backer. Mr. Guterres declined to comment about the White House\u2019s reported threats to cut financial support to the United Nations, saying he did not want to prejudge what has not yet been announced. \u201cWhen you talk too much about things that have not happened, you trigger the happening of those things,\u201d he said. He said he had held \u201ca very constructive discussion\u201d with the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley. \u201cWhat I am doing is to do everything I can to prove the added value of the U. N. to recognize the U. N. needs reforms, to be totally committed to those reforms,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. That, he argued, is \u201cthe best way to get, indeed, the support of all member states, including the United States of America and the new administration. \u201d Mr. Guterres had been more restrained in his criticism of the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban than some others at the United Nations. The organization\u2019s top human rights official, Zeid Ra\u2019ad   said in a Twitter post this week that Mr. Trump\u2019s order flouted international law. On Wednesday, five independent human rights experts for the United Nations also criticized the Trump administration in a statement that described the new American policy as a discriminatory action that had stigmatized Muslim communities. The countries affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s order are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Mr. Guterres, in his comments on Wednesday, also warned of a backlash. \u201cWhen we adopt measures that spread anxiety and anger,\u201d he said, \u201cwe help trigger the kind of recruitment mechanism that these organizations are doing everywhere in the world. \u201d Legal experts say the executive order could collide with international law. It is already facing numerous legal challenges in American courts. No country is legally obliged to provide resettlement to refugees, and every country has the sovereign right to decide who is admitted into its territory. But the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty that came into force in 1976, prohibits a country from passing laws that discriminate on the basis of religion or national origin. James C. Hathaway, a University of Michigan law professor, argued that the United States therefore cannot limit resettlement based on religion or national origin. Additionally, laws governing the rights of refugees prohibit sending people back to countries where they could face persecution. In a post on the legal site Just Security, Mr. Hathaway called Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cwillfully blind\u201d to the United States\u2019 obligation under that law.'"}, "time": 1742563824.2106574}
