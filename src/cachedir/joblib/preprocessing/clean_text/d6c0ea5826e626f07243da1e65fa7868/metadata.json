[The movie, \u201cFor Here Or To Go?\u201d offers a very flattering image of the almost 1 million       holding   jobs throughout the United States. The   movie follows the efforts by   contract workers to get green cards and dates. It features a      number, but it sidelines the wishes and worries of many   young Americans whose salaries and careers are being undercut by the flood of cheap   contract workers.  The movie\u2019s basic message is that foreigners are entitled to live in the United States if they want to do so, regardless of American law or Americans\u2019 wishes. \u201cYou can build your life where you choose to. The question is and always will be this: Where do you think you belong? Where is home?\u201d says one supporting character to the lead character. \u201cI have actively supported this movie realizing its importance as an advocacy tool [and] many renowned venture capitalists, founders, entrepreneurs, academics have also been supporting it,\u201d said an online statement from Tahmina Watson, an immigration lawyer serving Indian and Chinese customers in Seattle, Wash. \u201cSome [supporters\u2019] names include Brad Feld, renowned [venture capitalist] [  booster] Vivek   academic and think tank, the Instagram founder [Mike Krieger] and many many more,\u201d she wrote March 31. Investor \u201cBrad Feld donated $25, 000 to the movie!   \u2026     my dear friend and [immigration lawyer] member Joel Paget who donated a huge sum to the movie,\u201d she wrote.  In 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump promised to revamp the program so that it doesn\u2019t hurt Americans workers. \u201cThese are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,\u201d said a March 2016 statement from the campaign. \u201cI remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread   abuse. \u201d That promise was a winning argument for many university educated voters who were being pressured by peers and employers to pull the lever for Hillary Clinton.  However, many   companies favor the   program, so it remains largely unchanged since Trump took office. Immigration lawyers expect the administration to start issuing another 85, 000   visas starting April. Multiple Democratic and GOP politicians hope to further expand the     program.  For example, SGOP Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a March 30   that \u201cwe\u2019ve had a process for bringing   workers from other countries to the United States to fill jobs for which there is a shortage of American labor   \u2026     But the system is   . Our immigration laws cap the number of   worker visas \u2014  also called   visas \u2014  that employers may obtain each year at a number that is far below demand. \u201d Also, both Hatch and North Carolina\u2019s GOP Thomas Tillis want to provide a path to citizenship to any foreigner who pays for a graduate degree at an American university. \u201cOur laws also lack a straightforward path for companies to hire foreign students at American universities on a permanent basis after graduation   \u2026     This makes no sense,\u201d said Hatch. \u201cWe should have a policy that basically staples a green card on the back of their diploma, with the agreement that they will work and contribute to the American economy,\u201d Tillis said  . But that \u201cstaple\u201d policy would create an unlimited supply of Indian, Chinese, South Americans, European and African professionals eager to underbid salaries sought by young and   American professionals. In Washington, the new movie is being touted by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and by the CATO Institute, which favors an easy flow of labor across national borders. It is also being supported by Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s   lobby, FWD. us, via its head, Todd Schulte. The movie is also being touted by Jose Andrews, an immigration proponent who hires cheap labor for his D. C. restaurants. It is \u201cthe movie that you want to watch  \u2014  it is an amazing story of immigrants in America. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to tell a new story here  \u2026     and I\u2019m fully supportive of it,\u201d said Ash Kalra, an   city councilor in San Jose, California, \u201cThis is really where the best and brightest of the Indian community have come to contribute. \u201d Last September, the movie was shown to staffers in Congress, said Watson. September 2nd 2016 was a very special day.  It was the day that the movie For Here or To Go? had a special private screening at the Rayburn House   one of the Buildings where Congressmen have their offices. Fresh off the heels of the announcement of International Entrepreneur Rules, this movie screening was so timely. The private screening was attended by staffers, lawyers, lobbyists and other influencers. We were especially grateful that the White House Assistant Director of Entrepreneurship Doug Rand attended in person. We were also delighted that Senator Tim Kaine\u2019s office was represented.  While Sen. Kaine is now candidate for Vice President, he was one of the original   of the Startup Visa. A huge thank you goes to my very own Congressman Adam Smith ( ) who   in holding the event.  The Congressman\u2019s office went above and beyond in helping with the event, for which we are so grateful. We were also able to partner with Unshackled Ventures, an organization that recognizes the invaluable contributions of international entrepreneurs and has been at the forefront of the issue. And lastly, we wouldn\u2019t have had refreshments without the generous support of FWD. us and it\u2019s president Todd Schulte. In addition, two of my colleagues Joel Paget, immigration lawyer in Seattle and Sonal Verma in Washington DC both gave incredible support and encouragement in holding the event.   \u2026     Rishi and I had the privilege of attending a reception at the CATO institute where we had the distinct pleasure of meeting immigration policy extraordinaire Alex Nowrasteh! The movie is opening at 29 theater screens, including four screens in the D. C. area, three in Texas and six screens in California. The annual inflow of roughly 110, 000     takes jobs for   rates at U. S.  companies, universities, and  . That makes sense for the foreign workers because many hope to get the hugely valuable   prize of citizenship from the U. S. government after perhaps ten years of work. The citizenship bonus can also be duplicated for their parents, siblings, children ad grandchildren. The deal is also rational for U. S. employers because they pay   rates and also don\u2019t have to pay the citizenship bonus to the   workers. That good for many U. S. companies because it means they can get subcontracting work done for cheaper and because it also lowers the marketplace salaries for all U. S. professionals.    are hired by many   companies, displacing Americans who want jobs with Microsoft or Facebook, Caterpillar or   Goldman Sachs or McDonald\u2019s. At least 100, 000   are also employed in universities, hospitals,   and government research centers as professors, scientists, doctors, and therapists.  But critics  \u2014   and much evidence  \u2014   say the   program is rife with corruption, including fake resumes, fraudulent visa applications,    payments, workplace and hiring discrimination against Americans, as well as false claims by lobbyists and corporates that too few Americans want to work at companies such as Goldman Sachs or Facebook.  Additional   programs deliver  The inflow of   workers cuts salaries for young Americans who are in direct competition with    \u2014   mostly software experts, medical researchers, accountants, doctors, statisticians.  But it also reduces the salaries of other American professionals  \u2014   designers, journalists, business school graduates and even    \u2014   by increasing the nation\u2019s supply of skilled, flexible   experts who can perform a variety of skilled jobs.  A 2016 report by the National Academies of Science showed that   immigration annually transfers roughly $500 billion from American employees over to investors and employers.
