Mr. Johnson, appearing flustered, was at a loss to come up with a name. He grasped at a former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, who has been critical of Donald J. Trump, but was unable to remember his name without help  \u2014   or the name of any sitting leader of a foreign country. \u201cI guess I\u2019m having an Aleppo moment,\u201d he said. Mr. Johnson was referring to a remarkably similar episode earlier this month when, during another interview on MSNBC, he was asked how he would deal with the continuing situation in Aleppo, the ravaged Syrian city at the center of that country\u2019s refugee crisis. \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d Mr. Johnson said at the time. Mr. Matthews, who was interviewing Mr. Johnson and former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, his running mate, live at the University of New Hampshire, appeared to stall to give Mr. Johnson more time after the candidate repeated the initial question, looking slightly panicked. \u201cAny one of the continents, any country, name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to, anybody,\u201d Mr. Matthews said. Mr. Johnson exhaled loudly. \u201cMine was Shimon Peres,\u201d Mr. Weld interjected. Mr. Matthews clarified that he was looking for someone who was still alive. He then named various countries and continents  \u2014   Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia  \u2014   in an apparent attempt to jog Mr. Johnson\u2019s memory. Mr. Johnson then made the \u201cAleppo moment\u201d comment, indicating that he was having trouble coming up with Mr. Fox\u2019s name. \u201cBut I\u2019m giving you the whole world!\u201d Mr. Matthews shouted, interrupting him. Mr. Weld eventually supplied Mr. Fox\u2019s last name to Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Matthews, apparently having given up on the presidential candidate, asked the eager Mr. Weld to name his own favorite foreign leader, looking to conclude a painful exchange that felt significantly longer than the 50 seconds or so that it lasted. Mr. Weld paused for half a second. \u201cUm, Merkel?\u201d he said, referring to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. \u201cCan\u2019t argue with that,\u201d Mr. Matthews said, as the crowd applauded.'"}, "time": 1742561765.9850771}
