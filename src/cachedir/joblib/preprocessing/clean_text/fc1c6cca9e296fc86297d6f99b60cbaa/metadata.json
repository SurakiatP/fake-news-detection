Smith questioned Romo\u2019s special treatment because of the lack of success he experienced as the starter in Dallas compared to black athletes such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb. \u201cDo you know of any black athlete that won just two playoff games, didn\u2019t have any kind of postseason success whatsoever that gets celebrated like this?\u201d Smith asked. \u201cUsually there is a requirement to have some kind of success in order to garner the celebratory atmosphere and ambiance that we saw for Romo. \u201d   Max Kellerman responded by saying he could not think of any athlete of any race who is \u201cfeted\u201d to the same extent as Romo. \u201c[A]s an     \u2026     I\u2019m enlightening you about the fact that these are the kinds of things away from the white community that when folks in the black community huddle amongst ourselves and talk about things and talk about discrepancies, it\u2019s the kind of stuff that irks us,\u201d Smith replied. \u201cBecause we know that those are the kinds of things that are not reserved for us. Sports is supposed to be the closest thing to a meritocracy. Where is it here?\u201d ESPN\u2019s Will Cain called Smith\u2019s white privilege argument \u201cso much nonsense and so much junk,\u201d adding to make the debate racial \u201cdetracts\u201d from the \u201creal racial issues. \u201d \u201cWhat you just said was so much nonsense, and so much junk,\u201d Cain told Smith. \u201cTo make this racial is so far beyond the pale that it makes real racial issues hard to pay attention to. It detracts. \u201d Smith angrily replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to just chirp chirp chirp and talk about what we\u2019re supposed to feel, and I don\u2019t get a chance to respond. What the hell do you think this is? Let me be very, very clear: You\u2019re not black. Don\u2019t think for one second you get to tell me how to feel. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742562662.9035816}
