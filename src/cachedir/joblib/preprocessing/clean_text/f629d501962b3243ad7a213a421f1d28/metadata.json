Trump at a concert on Saturday in California before tumbling into a     speech addressing radio programmers, MTV, his friends and collaborators Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg and more. After getting an array of grievances off his chest  \u2014   from   politics to   politics  \u2014   Mr. West ended the performance with a microphone drop, having played only three songs, leaving fans bitter and upset, according to reactions on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s a new world,\u201d Mr. West said from his floating platform stage above the crowd. \u201cFeelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in Middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. \u201d The brief concert, at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, came two nights after Mr. West shocked his audience by announcing at a show in San Jose, Calif. that he had not voted, but would have cast a ballot for Mr. Trump if he had. Though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like Black Lives Matter and women\u2019s rights, he praised Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmethod of communication\u201d as \u201cvery futuristic. \u201d On Saturday night, in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current Saint Pablo tour, Mr. West doubled down on his embrace of   political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m taking his lead,\u201d Mr. West said of the  . \u201cA lot of people here tonight felt like they lost,\u201d the rapper began. \u201cYou know why? Because y\u2019all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. \u201d Turning his focus on the music industry, Mr. West questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by Drake but not Frank Ocean, and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows. Referring to this year\u2019s MTV Video Music Awards, Mr. West pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political    dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn\u2019t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \u2018Hotline Bling,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here to give y\u2019all my truth even at the risk of my own life  \u2014   even at the risk of my own success, my own career. \u201d However, Mr. West said, such   was necessary for real progress. \u201cObama couldn\u2019t make America great because he couldn\u2019t be him to be who he was,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack men have been slaves. Obama wasn\u2019t allowed to do this\u201d  \u2014   the rapper screamed  \u2014   \u201cand still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don\u2019t always change\u201d things. When more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech, disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds. On Sunday, the Golden 1 Center announced that ticketholders would be paid back in full, including Ticketmaster fees. On Monday, a representative for Mr. West said that remaining dates on the second leg of the \u201cSaint Pablo\u201d tour have been canceled. Even amid his raw, spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue, Mr. West seemed to know he was courting controversy. \u201cI\u2019m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to say how I feel. \u201d He added, \u201cGet ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show\u2019s over. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564298.6833568}
