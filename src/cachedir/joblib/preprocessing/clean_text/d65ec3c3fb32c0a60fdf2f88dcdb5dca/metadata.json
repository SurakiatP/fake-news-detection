Some of us were extremely concerned about these revelations while others learned to live with them\u2014but very few of us realised that sooner rather than later, it would be we the people who actually gained such free access to the secrets of our big brothers. \\nJust a week or so before the American presidential election, it has become clear that, rather than them looking at us and making us feel vulnerable and exposed, it is actually us, the people, who are sitting in front of our TV screens being entertained by Clinton\u2019s emails and the revelations about her ties with the most horrible people on the planet. \\nIt seems as if us \u2018little brothers\u2019 are growing tired of our \u2018big brother\u2019 and such a realisation points to a shift in consciousness that could lead to complete social revolution. The awareness is certainly here already. \\nGilad Atzmon is an Israeli jazz musician, author and political activist. His new book, \u201cThe Wandering Who,\u201d may be ordered from amazon.com or amazon.co.uk .'"}, "time": 1742563248.1708496}
