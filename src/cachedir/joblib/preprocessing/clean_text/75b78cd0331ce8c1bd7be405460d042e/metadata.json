According to an SVT report, The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages, meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets. According to Speisa , \u201cThe change is a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the country\u2019s Christian traditions, but according to the Swedish Transport Administration, the decision for the drastic change is \u201csecurity\u201d. \u201cPoles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,\u201d said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. The argument that the lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk sounds like complete baloney. Swedes are being asked to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. Despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades, this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of Muslim migrants flooded into the country \u2013 just a coincidence I\u2019m sure. In reality, the Christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending Muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like Malmo , where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near Muslim ghetto \u2018no-go areas\u2019 is becoming a routine occurrence. As we previously reported , a top Swedish Bishop advocated removing crosses from a Christian church and replacing them with Islamic symbols in order to please Muslims. Last Christmas, it was also announced that a Christmas Eve special broadcast on public television would be hosted by a Muslim woman. Some areas of Sweden are even capitulating to returning ISIS terrorists by offering jihadists free driving licenses and housing benefits to help them \u201creintegrate into the job market\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742564436.191015}
