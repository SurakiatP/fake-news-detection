Such technology will go a long way to defending allies against the Chinese menace and battling Moscow\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d in the Baltics. \\nThe missile system is sponsored by an office created by Carter in 2012, the Strategic Capabilities Office, which is currently being lead by Will Roper, a protege\u2019 of the Secretary\u2019s. During a panel at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on Friday Roper told an audience, \u201cHow you offset the adversaries trying to offset your offset? It\u2019s very simple to do that, you just don\u2019t talk about your best capabilities\u2026We are keeping our best ideas behind the door and probably always will,\u201d according to Breaking Defense. \\nAfter the panel, he continued, \u201cWe thought it was important to come out (in public) with ATACMS for the Army because there\u2019s been a lot of writing, a lot of speeches, on the need for the Army to go cross-domain.\u201d High ranking officials in the US military have been calling for the ATACMS to extend its capabilities seaward for some time, and Roper responded to these concerns saying, \u201cit\u2019s time for us to show it isn\u2019t just a theoretical idea, it\u2019s something we can potentially get to quickly with something that we already have.\u201d \\nDuring a morning session at CSIS Carter spoke of the new innovative features of the ATACMS, and how the SCO tries to maximize the potential of existing systems. \\n\u201cA prominent theme of SCO\u2019s work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions, and across varied domains\u201d, he said, adding, \u201c\u2026 By integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile, they\u2019re enabling it to hit moving targets, both at sea as well as on land. With this capability, what was previously an Army surface-to-surface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to 300 kilometers into the maritime domain.\u201d \\nCarter detailed the SCO\u2019s plans to utilize seeker technology that the Defense Department has already developed so the missile system can hit targets both on sea and land. \\nLockheed Martin was awarded the $174 million contract for the long range artillery rocket system in May 2015. Ken Musculus, vice president of tactical missiles at the defense contractor said at the time that ATACMS is \u201creliable and proven in combat, which is why it continues to be our customers\u2019 choice for long-range strike requirements.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564525.5710902}
