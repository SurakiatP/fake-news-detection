Surrounded by men in jackets barking trade orders, she stood out in her pleated skirt and twin sweater set. Traders around her began wagering over how long Ms. Fitzpatrick, then 22, would last. \u201cThe floor was definitely not a place for people who were cute, prim and proper,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said in a recent interview. Those who bet against her lost. Ms. Fitzpatrick began her career at O\u2019Connor  Associates, the Chicago firm that was later acquired by UBS as the Swiss bank\u2019s internal hedge fund. She rose to lead the firm and become one of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful women. Now, largely unknown outside the industry, Ms. Fitzpatrick faces her biggest and most public challenge yet: working for George Soros, the estimable octogenarian investor and philanthropist. Last Monday, she started as chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, which manages around $26 billion of Mr. Soros\u2019s personal and family wealth. In taking the job, she follows in the footsteps of finance legends including Keith Anderson, a   of BlackRock, and Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor. Even Steven Mnuchin, the new Treasury secretary, was once brought in to open a lending business. Mr. Soros himself is perhaps the finance world\u2019s most famous investor. In 1992, he made a $1 billion bet against the British pound. The trade came to be known as one that \u201cbroke the Bank of England\u201d when Mr. Soros\u2019s heavy selling of the country\u2019s currency helped prompt the government to devalue the pound. But since Mr. Druckenmiller left the firm in 2000, Soros Fund Management has churned through eight chief investment officers. It\u2019s a remarkable turnover for the top of any company, even among hedge funds, which are known for a cutthroat culture. It\u2019s even less typical in the sleepy world of family offices, where employees manage the assets of a single clan, which is how the Soros funds are now structured after years of accepting outside investor money. And Soros is not just another family office designed to maximize wealth. There is a direct link between the money that is made at Soros and its founder\u2019s philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Soros, now 86, is an outspoken supporter of Democrats including Hillary Clinton, and travels the world seeking to promote democracy. The $1 billion that Mr. Soros made betting against the British pound, for example, helped to support scientists in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. Though Ms. Fitzpatrick is registered as a Republican, she appears unfazed that her investing acumen will in turn support Mr. Soros\u2019s activism. \u201cIf we do a good job in terms of generating returns, the impact the money created can have is tremendous, and that\u2019s really motivating,\u201d she said. Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick, 47, takes over at Soros at a moment of global uncertainty. Impending elections in France and Germany threaten to upset the status quo across Europe. The United States is only beginning to absorb the implications of Donald J. Trump\u2019s young presidency. Markets around the world are holding steady but seem liable to drop on any given day. Ms. Fitzpatrick is bullish. She believes stocks in the United States, having hit record highs, can rise higher still. But she attributes this optimism to what she says are fundamentally healthy companies, not investor giddiness over the Trump presidency. \u201cIn reality, if we had Hillary Clinton as our president, I think we\u2019d be here or higher,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said. At the height of the financial crisis of a decade or so ago, Ms. Fitzpatrick faced the biggest decision of her career. She had risen to become chief investment officer at O\u2019Connor, then a unit of UBS, and now had to steer the firm through a period of market upheavals that would leave some of the biggest names on Wall Street bankrupt. In the summer of 2008, Ms. Fitzpatrick received a call from Richard S. Fuld, then the chief executive of Lehman Brothers. Mr. Fuld acknowledged that Lehman\u2019s stock was tumbling, but he told Ms. Fitzpatrick it would recover and asked her not to pull the billions of dollars that O\u2019Connor had with the bank\u2019s prime brokerage, a division that lends stock and cash to   clients for trading, in exchange for housing some of the funds\u2019 capital. Ms. Fitzpatrick had a quandary. If she maintained her balance and Lehman managed to survive, she would keep a relationship with a critical Wall Street partner. But if she kept her balance and Lehman went bankrupt, she would lose billions of dollars for UBS O\u2019Connor\u2019s clients. \u201cShe did something no one else did,\u201d recalled Michael Meyer, a former UBS O\u2019Connor employee who was there at the time. \u201cShe quickly assessed the situation with him and said: \u2018Dick, your stock is trading at $22. If the stock goes to $15, I\u2019m taking half out, and if the stock reaches $10, I\u2019m taking it all out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Meyer recalled. Ultimately, of course, Lehman failed, triggering some of the worst convulsions of the financial crisis and costing many investors billions. Ms. Fitzpatrick was able to avoid the worst of it, and saved the firm from getting trapped in years of bankruptcy proceedings. Other hedge funds that didn\u2019t pull their money were stuck in losing market positions, unable to use their money to make new trades. Though the episode left her shaken, it was the kind of quick thinking she had prepared for. Born and raised in Irvington, N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick was the middle child among five siblings who grew up in a    on a street bustling with young families. She spent much of her childhood competing with taller, stronger brothers and sisters who excelled at sports like basketball. By her own description, Ms. Fitzpatrick was \u201cshort and scrawny. \u201d Her father, she said, still jokes that she is the \u201crunt of the litter. \u201d Eventually she found her stride. She turned to running, something she continues to do today, usually at 5 a. m. (She still holds the record for the 3, 000 meter run at her high school.) A neighbor, Marty Atlas, nurtured her early interest in the markets, showing a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick how stock tables worked. Even as a girl, her investing prowess was evident. \u201cI remember her playing Monopoly with all these other kids, and she ended up with all the hotels,\u201d Mr. Atlas said. Ms. Fitzpatrick quickly zeroed in on her goal for after college: Wall Street. \u201cIt was the one place where you could succeed beyond your wildest dreams,\u201d she recalled. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School with a bachelor of science degree in 1992, Ms. Fitzpatrick landed a job with O\u2019Connor  Associates as part of a junior group of American Stock Exchange clerks. She moved on to trade options for O\u2019Connor at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. There, groups of traders gathered in pits to buy and sell major trading contracts, yelling out their orders while gesticulating madly. Ms. Fitzpatrick, once again an outsider on a   trading floor, mastered the jargon and the hand signals. It was in Chicago that Ms. Fitzpatrick learned just how cruel markets could be. In December 1994, an economic crisis was looming in Mexico that resulted in a swift and drastic devaluation of the Mexican peso. Ms. Fitzpatrick was covering a pit where   locals  \u2014   traders who made bets with their own money  \u2014   were exposed on the wrong side when the American Depository Receipts of Mexican companies moved suddenly. They lost everything. \u201cBasically overnight, these guys who I would stand next to from 9:30 a. m. to 4 p. m. every day lost their homes, lost their marriages, just everything in a flash,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said. \u201cIt really left an indelible mark on me. \u201d In the course of her career, Ms. Fitzpatrick has tangled with regulators. While chief investment officer of O\u2019Connor, Ms. Fitzpatrick oversaw the firm\u2019s $5. 3 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over charges that from 2009 to 2011 it had bought stocks in companies\u2019 public offerings while also taking the opposite position,   those same stocks. The bank denied wrongdoing. More than 23 firms were slapped with similar charges. \u201cDawn would see possible risks, multiple layers, beyond anyone else in the room,\u201d said Ross Margolies, the founder of Stelliam Investment Management, which Ms. Fitzpatrick and O\u2019Connor seeded in 2007. \u201cIt was almost like she was playing a game of   chess. \u201d In the world of finance, women can find themselves at a disadvantage, their careers stymied by overt sexism and implicit bias alike. The paucity of senior positions held by women in banks and other financial firms, which a recent Financial Times survey put at less than 26 percent, would seem to underscore that belief. As the first female chief investment officer at Soros, Ms. Fitzpatrick becomes a woman with few peers most everyone managing such a large pot of money on Wall Street is a man. Ms. Fitzpatrick said that, on the whole, she has not felt discriminated against because of her gender in the workplace. At UBS, Ms. Fitzpatrick kept a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes under her desk but often walked around the office barefoot, a display of her confidence. \u201cClearly, there are single moments in time when I would have rather been a         guy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those tended to be offset by the times when I thought it was an advantage to be a woman. \u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick says women have innately useful qualities when it comes to money management. \u201cOne of the things I believe women have more of is humility in their investments,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut losers quicker, in a more effective way, than generally men will. \u201d Indeed, some studies suggest that women are more successful risk managers than men. Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick has also caught herself masking her femininity to keep up with her male colleagues. Days after giving birth to her second child, she was on a flight to London for a meeting wearing several layers of Spanx, the tightfitting undergarments meant to conceal extra pounds. \u201cFrom my perspective, perceptions matter, and it was important for me that I was there,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to think I was anything but focused. \u201d Such   ambition can be a distraction, too. A few years later, in the summer of 2008, Ms. Fitzpatrick was so consumed by her work that she didn\u2019t realize she was pregnant for several months. The financial crisis was beginning to unfold, and the markets were swinging violently. She was often sick to her stomach, and was also getting heavier, but she figured her discomfort was a result of her stress. Plenty of her peers were having visceral reactions to the crisis. \u201cThe fall comes, and I\u2019m nauseous, and I\u2019m gaining weight, and it doesn\u2019t even cross my mind that I could be pregnant,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said. Today, Ms. Fitzpatrick maintains the long hours and relentless travel schedule common among financial executives. It keeps her away from her three children and her husband more than she would like. But she lives in Irvington, the town where she grew up, and her two sisters and her parents still live nearby. They help with the children. She admits, however, that her relentless drive is \u201cnot necessarily a virtue for everyone. \u201d In her new role, Ms. Fitzpatrick oversees assets that Soros Fund Management invests directly, as well as more than a handful of outside hedge fund managers and private equity firms. It is similar to the role Ms. Fitzpatrick played at UBS O\u2019Connor several years ago. And during her last year at the Swiss bank, she held a more strategic role, managing teams across all of UBS\u2019s asset management unit, and overseeing more than half a trillion dollars. It was a prestigious job, but one that removed her from the    trading and market strategizing that associates say she loves most. Now, \u201cshe will basically be able to sit down with those managers whom they\u2019ve allocated money to, and really be able to speak the language,\u201d said Rich Cunningham, a managing director at Barclays Investment Bank. Among the new challenges she will face is all that turnover at Soros. Ted Burdick, the previous chief investment officer there, stepped down after just eight months on the job, though he remains with the firm. Others who have held Ms. Fitzpatrick\u2019s role have been caught up in the internal politics of the firm, and at times clashed with Mr. Soros himself. Ms. Fitzpatrick may be at less risk because, unlike some previous chief investment officers, she will be reporting to the family office\u2019s board of directors, rather than just Mr. Soros, who is the chairman of the board. And yet Mr. Soros, one of history\u2019s best traders, still can\u2019t help but sometimes want to manage his own money. Last year, as Britain prepared to vote on whether to exit the European Union, Mr. Soros stepped back into his    engagement, placing wagers that would be affected by the June referendum. The \u201cBrexit\u201d outcome, a surprise to many, triggered significant market swings, and Mr. Soros benefited from a position that predicted shares of Deutsche Bank would fall, among other trades. Later in the year, however, Mr. Soros lost around $1 billion wagering that Mr. Trump would lose the presidential election. Beyond his occasional trading, there could be a disconnect between Mr. Soros and his new chief investment officer. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Mr. Soros mixed his views on politics and finance to deliver a bleak economic prognosis. Yes, investors were bullish, thanks to the belief that Mr. Trump would dismantle regulations and reduce taxes. But, he said, Mr. Trump would fail to achieve those policy goals. \u201cI don\u2019t think the markets are going to do very well,\u201d Mr. Soros said. Ms. Fitzpatrick, however, says that although she is more bullish on the stock market than her boss, they are not out of sync on the big picture. \u201cAs an investor,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to continuously evolve and learn. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628444.246465}
