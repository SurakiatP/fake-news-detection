{"duration": 0.12681078910827637, "input_args": {"text": "'Weeks after a new North Carolina law put transgender bathroom access at the heart of the nation\u2019s culture wars, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. ruled on Tuesday in favor of a transgender student who was born female and wishes to use the boys\u2019 restroom at his rural Virginia high school. Advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people note that the ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit applies to North Carolina, where the controversial law approved last month limits transgender people to bathrooms in government buildings, including public schools, that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates. As a result of the ruling, those advocates say, that portion of the North Carolina law that applies to public schools now clearly violates Title IX  \u2014   the federal law that prohibits gender discrimination in schools. \u201cOur expectation is that the North Carolina schools reverse course immediately, as in tomorrow,\u201d Sarah Warbelow, the legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, an L. G. B. T. rights group, said Tuesday night. The ruling in favor of Gavin Grimm, a junior at Gloucester High School in southeastern Virginia, does not immediately grant him the right to use the boys\u2019 restrooms rather, it directs a lower court that had ruled against him to   Mr. Grimm\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to be able to use those restrooms. But it is the first time that a federal appellate court has ruled that Title IX protects the rights of such students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. The ruling also comes as some school districts and state governments around the country are grappling with the question of whether transgender people should be allowed to go to the public facilities that correspond with their gender identity, or whether, as many conservatives believe, such access would infringe on the privacy rights of others. Boycotts and protests have followed the passage of the North Carolina law, but Gov. Pat McCrory has essentially stood by it. On Tuesday, Joshua Block, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case on Mr. Grimm\u2019s behalf, argued that such state and local legislation violated federal law. \u201cWith this decision, we hope that schools and legislators will finally get the message that excluding transgender kids from the restrooms is unlawful sex discrimination,\u201d he said in a statement. The North Carolina law has prompted the Obama administration to consider whether the state would be ineligible for billions of dollars in federal funding for schools, housing and highways. Mr. McCrory, a Republican who is seeking   in November, and other supporters of the law have played down suggestions that the Obama administration would rescind those billions. Mr. McCrory\u2019s Democratic opponent, Roy Cooper, the state\u2019s attorney general, has said in the past that the law may put the federal funding at risk and has refused to defend the state in a lawsuit challenging it. In a statement Tuesday, Mr. McCrory said he strongly disagreed with President Obama and Mr. Cooper\u2019s objective \u201cto force our high schools to allow boys in girls\u2019 restrooms, locker rooms or shower facilities,\u201d but would evaluate the effect of Tuesday\u2019s ruling on North Carolina law and policy. The A. C. L. U. brought the case on behalf of Mr. Grimm, who was born female but identifies as a male, in June, seeking a preliminary injunction so that Mr. Grimm could use the boys\u2019 restrooms at his school. The school administration initially allowed him to do so, but the local school board later approved a policy that barred him from the boys\u2019 restrooms according to court documents, the policy also \u201crequired students with \u2018gender identity issues\u2019 to use an alternative private facility\u201d to go to the bathroom. Judge Robert G. Doumar of Federal District Court ruled against Mr. Grimm in September, dismissing his claim that the school board had violated Title IX, although the judge did allow his case to go forward under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The ruling by a   panel on Tuesday reversed the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the Title IX claim, stating that the District Court \u201cdid not accord appropriate deference\u201d to regulations issued by the Department of Education. The department\u2019s current guidelines dictate that schools \u201cgenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity. \u201d Roger Gannam, a lawyer with the conservative Liberty Counsel, which filed an amicus brief in the case on behalf of the defendant, the Gloucester County School Board, said Tuesday that the court had engaged in \u201cblatant judicial legislation. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing, and it\u2019s frightening, in a sense,\u201d he said. Mr. Block of the A. C. L. U. in a phone interview, said he was confident that the District Court would rule in Mr. Grimm\u2019s favor and allow him to use the restroom. And he noted that the five states covered by the Fourth Circuit  \u2014   Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, West Virginia and South Carolina  \u2014   must now follow the federal Department of Education\u2019s interpretation of Title IX on this issue. The Obama administration has been aggressive in its efforts to ensure that transgender students can use the bathrooms in public schools that correspond with their gender identities. Some federal agencies have threatened to rescind funding to pressure some municipal governments in California and Illinois to change their policies and allow transgender students to do so. In June, the Justice Department filed a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d in Mr. Grimm\u2019s case. \u201cWe are pleased with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision, which agreed with the position that the United States advocated in its brief,\u201d the Justice Department said in a statement Tuesday night. In an email, a clerk for the Gloucester school system said the superintendent, Walter Clemons, \u201chas no comment at this time. \u201d In a statement released through the A. C. L. U. Mr. Grimm said: \u201cI feel so relieved and vindicated by the court\u2019s ruling. Today\u2019s decision gives me hope that my fight will help other kids avoid discriminatory treatment at school. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562887.749635}
