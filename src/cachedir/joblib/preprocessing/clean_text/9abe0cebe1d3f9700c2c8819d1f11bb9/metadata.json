That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples. After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead, the public would discount a theft claim. Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal, and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done. \\nClearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him, and Hillary is their agent. \\nWith the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her, election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s own interests. \\nImage as well as money is part of Oligarchic power. The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation. \\nMoreover, a President Hillary would be under investigation for years. With so much spotlight on her, she would not be able to serve the Oligarchy\u2019s interests. She would be worthless to them, and, indeed, investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs. \\nIn other words, for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability. \\nA Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos. I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in, Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation. The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon, and look where that got him. \\nMoreover, the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it. House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be \u201ca target-rich environment. Even before we get to day one, we\u2019ve got two years worth of material already lined up.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence. \\nIf you were an oligarch, would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny? If you were Hillary, would you want to be under this kind of pressure? \\nWhat happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president? Even insouciant Americans would see the cover-up if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case. Americans would lose all confidence in the government. Chaos would rule. Chaos can be revolutionary, and that is not good for oligarchs. \\nMoreover, if reports can be believed, salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage. For example, last May Fox News reported: \\n\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d \u2014 even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. \u201cClinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\u201d \\nFox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for \u201csolicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \u2018Orgy Island,\u2019 an estate on Epstein\u2019s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201d http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html \\nSome Internet sites, the credibility of which is unknown to me, have linked Hillary to these flights. http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/ \\nThis kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary, who are accustomed to getting away with everything. Nevertheless, if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations, such as the one into the Clinton Foundation, and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650,000 emails on former US Rep. Weiner\u2019s computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation, putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesn\u2019t look like a good decision. \\nAt this point, I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump, instead of from him, rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy America\u2019s reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States. \\nBeing the \u201cexceptional nation\u201d takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm.
