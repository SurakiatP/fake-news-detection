The Federalist Papers reported that though it\u2019s likely that Hillary Clinton would have let most of Obama\u2019s people go so that she could hire her own staff, Trump\u2019s win closed the door on the possibility of any of Obama\u2019s staffer sticking around. The fired staffers have gotten so desperate about their employment situation that Obama has brought in representatives from Facebook, Instagram and other companies to offer insights into the job market. According to CBS News , Linkedin officials are helping Obama\u2019s staff find ways to market their skills. Georgetown University, which is located close to the White House, has designed a custom professional development program they call \u201cFuture44,\u201d Obama is the 44th president, to teach Obama\u2019s political appointees how to build their lives after the White House. The program is free of charge thanks to an anonymous donor, and participants register for either four 2-hour evening sessions or one 8-hour \u201cboot camp.\u201d \u201cWe designed this unique curriculum to help these staffers think through how to market themselves or market their competencies,\u201d said Kelly Otter, dean of Georgetown\u2019s School of Continuing Studies. Many of Obama\u2019s staffers will likely end up in liberal cities like New York or San Francisco working for companies that cater to millennials such as Amazon, Snapchat, Google, Vice, etc. \u201cThe transition out of government is a reality for most appointees, which brings both excitement about prospects for the next chapter or a long-awaited chance to recharge batteries, and a keen awareness about a big, impending change,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman. Ivan Adler, a headhunter at McCormick Group, explained that Obama\u2019s staffers are about to face a major change in life that may be hard to get through. \u201cI tell everybody: You have to understand there\u2019s likely nothing you will do professionally that will have the same amount of excitement you\u2019ve just gone through in the White House, unless you become a racecar driver or an astronaut,\u201d he said. Too bad, so sad\u2026Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out, Obama staffers! \\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment...
