He added that it was bad over the \u201clong haul\u201d because the audiences Hannity and others are reaching are more concerned with ideology than facts. Partial transcript as follows: HANNITY: We have to give some credit to the American people that they\u2019re somewhat intelligent and that they know the difference between an opinion show and a news show. You\u2019re cynical. KOPPEL: I am cynical. HANNITY: Do you think we\u2019re bad for America? You think I\u2019m bad for America? KOPPEL: Yeah. HANNITY: You do? Really? KOPPEL: In the long haul I think you and all these opinion shows  \u2014   HANNITY: That\u2019s sad, Ted. That\u2019s sad. KOPPEL: No, you know why?
