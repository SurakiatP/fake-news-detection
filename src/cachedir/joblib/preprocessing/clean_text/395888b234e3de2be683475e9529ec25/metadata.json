The proposal to increase military spending by $54 billion and cut nonmilitary programs by the same amount was unveiled by White House officials as they prepared the president\u2019s plans for next year\u2019s federal budget. Aides to the president said final decisions about Medicare and Social Security would not be made until later in the year, when he announces his full budget. But Sean Spicer, his spokesman, cited Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign commitments about protecting those programs and vowed that \u201che\u2019s going to keep his word to the American people. \u201d In effect, Mr. Trump appears determined to take sides in a generational struggle between older, sicker Americans who depend on the entitlement programs, and their younger, poorer counterparts whose livelihoods are shaped by the domestic programs likely to see steep cuts. He also set up a battle for control of Republican Party ideology with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who for years has staked his   reputation on the argument that taming the budget deficit without tax increases would require that Congress change, and cut, the programs that swallow the bulk of the government\u2019s spending  \u2014   Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you take $54 billion out without wholesale taking out entire departments,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a longtime Republican budget aide in the Senate and now a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cYou need to control it in the area of the entitlement programs, which he\u2019s taken off the table. It is a proposal, I dare say, that will be dead on arrival even with a Republican Congress. \u201d Speaking to governors at the White House, Mr. Trump said his spending demands would be at the core of the speech he gives Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress. \u201cThis budget follows through on my promise to keep Americans safe,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cpublic safety and national security\u201d budget that will send a \u201cmessage to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve. \u201d In the first part of the speech, Mr. Trump will recount \u201cpromises made and promises kept,\u201d said the aides, who requested anonymity during a briefing with reporters. The rest of the speech will focus on how he will help people with their problems and how he intends to protect the nation. The president\u2019s budget proposals  \u2014   which were short on detail but are said to exempt not just Medicare and Social Security but also veterans\u2019 benefits and law enforcement efforts  \u2014   would lead to deep reductions in federal programs that touch millions of lives. The White House signaled that it would begin with agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and social   programs. A budget with no entitlement cuts and one that does not balance most likely has no chance of passing the House, and could be rejected by Senate Republicans as well. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals are too far to the right in terms of domestic cuts and too far to the left in terms of balance. Their failure could have practical implications for the White House. If Congress fails to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to drastically rewrite the tax code could also die, since the president was counting on that budget resolution to include special parliamentary language that would shield his tax cuts from a Democratic filibuster. Without it, any tax legislation would have to be bipartisan enough to clear the Senate with 60 votes. But beyond legislative considerations, the fate of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal will go a long way toward determining how significantly his brand of economic populism has changed Republican orthodoxy. Mr. Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that Republican promises to transform Medicare and slash entitlement spending were the reason the party lost the White House in 2012, helpfully   Mr. Ryan, who sat at the bottom of the ticket that year, in his analysis. Social Security, health care and net interest now comprise nearly 60 percent of all federal spending, and that figure is expected to soar to 82 percent over the next 10 years. \u201cPaul Ryan\u2019s budget plans with cuts to Social Security and Medicare are not that popular with most voters, and what helped elect Donald Trump was the promise not to cut benefits and programs,\u201d said Douglas Elmendorf, the recently departed director of the Congressional Budget Office and current dean of Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government. \u201cThat is an unresolved tension. \u201d White House officials said the broad outlines of a spending plan represented the logical culmination of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to make good on his campaign pledges to prune what he considers wasteful government spending even as he expands what he considers an underfunded military. \u201cIt will show the president is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do,\u201d said Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s budget director. \u201cWe are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers said aid to foreign governments, which makes up a tiny fraction of federal spending, was one such target. The budget for the I. R. S. which was the target of Republican criticism during Barack Obama\u2019s administration, would be slashed by 14 percent, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides grants for community banks and local development, would be all but eliminated. The White House blueprint calls for a 24 percent cut to the E. P. A. \u2019s budget, according to a person who had seen the document but was not authorized to speak on the record. That would amount to a reduction of about $2 billion from the agency\u2019s annual budget of about $8. 1 billion, reducing its spending to levels not seen since Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. But it is far from clear whether Congress will approve such steep cuts in popular programs. While congressional Republicans have long targeted the E. P. A. \u2019s regulatory authority, they are also aware that about half the agency\u2019s annual budget is passed through to popular   programs, like converting abandoned industrial sites into sports stadiums and other public facilities, which lawmakers of both parties are loath to cut. And most of the agency\u2019s federal office spending goes toward funding programs that are required by existing laws. Last year, even as congressional Republicans railed against the Obama administration\u2019s E. P. A. regulations, they proposed cutting only $291 million from the agency\u2019s budget. Environmental advocates denounced the proposed cuts, saying they would devastate environmental protection and public health programs while doing little to increase national security. \u201cThe assault on human health begins now with President Trump\u2019s plan to slash the E. P. A. \u2019s resources, which are vital to protecting Americans\u2019 drinking water and air from pollution,\u201d said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. But the information to emerge about the budget raises more questions than it answers. Democrats, of course, will be no friend, either. \u201cDemocrats will make crystal clear the misplaced priorities of the administration and the Republican majority,\u201d said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the   Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, \u201cand we will fight tooth and nail to protect services and investments that are critical to   American families and communities across the country. \u201d But the budget may be the most striking example in Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency of the ways in which he is challenging the orthodoxy of his own party. Since the start of his insurgent campaign, Mr. Trump has opposed the Republican Party\u2019s   positions on a range of policies, including free trade, how to deal with Russia and the future of government entitlement programs. Republicans in Congress had hoped that the influence of the two former Republican House members in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet  \u2014   Tom Price, head of health and human services, and Mr. Mulvaney  \u2014   would have led to new conclusions about the need to address entitlement programs that are swelling drastically with baby boomers\u2019 retirement. Instead, Mr. Trump appears intent on extracting the savings he needs for military spending from the one part of the budget already most squeezed, domestic discretionary spending.'"}, "time": 1742564620.0145845}
