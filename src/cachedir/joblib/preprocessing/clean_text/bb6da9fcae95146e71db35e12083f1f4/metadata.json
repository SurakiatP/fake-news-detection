She predicted President Trump would not get any pushback  \u2014   and probably not the credit he will deserve  \u2014   for bringing jobs back. \u201cWhen he calls these companies and harangues them and makes them build their plants in America, makes them invest in America, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, they\u2019re not going to come out and denounce Trump. They\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, it was just a hundred thousand jobs. It was just three thousand jobs.\u2019 Okay, if that\u2019s your best argument, no problem. \u201d But when it comes to   issues like immigration, Coulter predicted \u201cevery single entity\u201d would strike out at Trump, and he\u2019ll need stalwart political fighters to man the battlements. \u201cThe media and the Democrats most of all because, like I say, this is life or death for them, and idiot Republicans who seem to think that we owe Somalis, Guatemalans, and Mexicans for the legacy of slavery, it\u2019s the damndest thing,\u201d she remarked, surveying the forces that will line up against Trump on immigration reform.  As an example of furious pushback, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow described MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, speaking as the voice of the centrist establishment, \u201cgoing on a tear\u201d against Marlow\u2019s longtime friend Stephen Miller, who now serves as one of President Trump\u2019s advisers. He characterized the attack on Miller as \u201cdirty and dishonest. \u201d \u201cI will give our opposition credit: they have figured out the most powerful nerve center, besides Trump himself, within the Trump White House,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cYeah, it would be great for them to take out Trump. This is when we ought to be throwing a party for Stephen Miller and saying, \u2018Congratulations! They can\u2019t call you dumb they realize you\u2019re a very important component. \u2019\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d she said of Miller. \u201cYou know, what I would like to do is go back to when you and he were growing up in L. A. and I don\u2019t know, get ahold of the soil conditions or the water or something. The two of you  \u2014   oh, my gosh! So patriotic, so smart. You love your country. \u201d \u201cI was describing Steve Miller to some reporter recently. I was on a plane at the time, so I was writing out adjectives, and at the end of the sentence, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not just listing adjectives I\u2019m actually pausing and thinking about each one. But the main ones are brilliant and patriotic,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe same with you,\u201d she told Marlow. \u201cAnd to have that in these young kids, out of all places, Los Angeles! And then a few years later  \u2014   well, I won\u2019t even say her name, otherwise, she\u2019ll just start being attacked, the opposition will figure out the other person they need to take out of the Trump White House. \u201d  \u201cBut oh, my gosh. Thank God  \u2014   not taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain I mean it literally  \u2014   that Stephen Miller is on our side,\u201d Coulter said. Marlow proposed that Miller\u2019s effectiveness at moving the \u201c    Trumpian agenda\u201d as the reason he has been taking so much fire, even when his critics cannot pinpoint anything he did wrong. \u201cYes, he\u2019s very, very bright,\u201d Coulter agreed. \u201cIt always struck me, especially kids from Los Angeles, the very epitome of coastal elites, how seriously and genuinely Stephen Miller cared about   Americans. He\u2019s such a perfect fit for Trump. It would just casually come up in conversation. It was driving him crazy that they were being screwed over. \u201d She said she did not see the Joe Scarborough rant against Miller herself but had received many emails about it. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what it was about at first because they were just blistering, Tourette\u2019  emails about how they were never going to watch Morning Joe again,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand it, other than I gather the opposition has figured out, \u2018Danger, danger,   person who loves America! \u2019\u201d \u201cI probably don\u2019t need to worry because every time I do worry about something on Donald Trump\u2019s behalf, it turns out I didn\u2019t need to worry it\u2019s Trump,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cBut you know, there is the White House bubble. I was just thinking, I travel a lot, I know a lot of people, and a lot of people from different walks of life. Just this week, I\u2019ve talked to a Hollywood producer, and a union executive, and lots of cab drivers in New York City, Los Angeles, and so on, an actress, a Broadway actress and singer  \u2014   okay, I don\u2019t need to list them all. But it\u2019s been amazing to me how popular the   the   ban is, and how popular Donald Trump is, and in particular with  \u2014   I\u2019m not a liberal I don\u2019t think immigrants\u2019 opinions are more important than American opinions, but it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s contrary to the media narrative. Lots of immigrants in this country [are] wild about Trump, wild about the Muslim ban. \u201d  \u201cI mean, out there in the middle of the country, he is more beloved than he was the day he was inaugurated. And, by the way, got a larger crowd than Obama. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve written much about that, but I have the briefing book. It was a much bigger crowd, and we should probably spend the rest of the radio interview allowing me to prove that. But I kind of think he needs a rally in Washington or someplace. Go out to America,\u201d she advised. Ann Coulter is the author of numerous   books, most recently In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!
