{"duration": 1.2279400825500488, "input_args": {"text": "'The sexual harassment scandal that engulfed Fox News last year and led to the ouster of its chairman, Roger Ailes, continued to batter the network on Monday, as a new lawsuit described unwanted sexual advances by Mr. Ailes and two major advertisers pulled their spots from the show of its   host, Bill O\u2019Reilly.   and Hyundai said they were withdrawing their ads from Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s   show, \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d after The New York Times published an investigation this weekend that found five women who made allegations of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior against him. Those five women received settlements totaling about $13 million, The Times reported. Together, the developments portray a network buffeted by allegations on multiple fronts, even as it draws record ratings with programming supportive of President Trump. Staff members remain anxious, some said on Monday, over questions about its workplace culture and its priorities. If more advertisers abandon Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, it will be a blow to Fox News, which provides billions of dollars in revenue each year to its parent company, 21st Century Fox. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has long been the pugnacious face of a   lineup that sets the tone for conservative commentary. His show attracts almost four million viewers a night, and from 2014 through 2016 it generated more than $446 million in advertising revenue, according to the research firm Kantar Media. \u201cGiven the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don\u2019t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now,\u201d Donna Boland, the manager of corporate communications for   wrote in an email.   has spent an estimated $1. 9 million in ads on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d in the last year, according to iSpot. tv, the TV ad analytics firm. Hyundai cited \u201cthe recent and disturbing allegations\u201d in announcing that it was removing its ads from Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show. \u201cWe had upcoming advertising spots on the show, but are reallocating them,\u201d Hyundai said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs a company, we seek to partner with companies and programming that share our values of inclusion and diversity,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation as we plan future advertising decisions. \u201d Despite Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s history of settlements and the series of allegations against him, the company has extended his contract, which was set to expire this year, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. O\u2019Reilly makes about $18 million per year. When the company extended the contract, it knew of multiple settlements that had been reached with women who had complained about his behavior. The company says it has discussed the issue with Mr. O\u2019Reilly. It believes his new contract gives it more leverage over him regarding his behavior, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has said that the allegations are without merit. He did not address the controversy on his show Monday night. Earlier on Monday, Julie Roginsky, a current Fox News contributor, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Ailes, Fox News and Bill Shine, the network\u2019s   asserting that she faced retaliation for rebuffing Mr. Ailes\u2019s sexual advances and for refusing to disparage Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who sued Mr. Ailes last summer. And a former regular guest on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program, Wendy Walsh, who had recounted her allegations against him to The Times, held a news conference with her lawyer to discuss those claims and to call for an independent inquiry into sexual harassment at the network. Also, the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan is investigating Fox News, including how it structured settlements. On Monday, Fox News moved to contain the fallout from the weekend\u2019s developments, urging its employees in an internal memo to report inappropriate behavior to the human resources department or other network executives. \u201cParticularly in light of some of the accounts published over the last few days, I wanted to   the message we have been conveying at our training sessions for several months,\u201d said Kevin Lord, the network\u2019s new head of human resources, who was hired in the aftermath of the Ailes scandal. Irena Briganti, a Fox News spokeswoman, declined to comment on advertising decisions, Ms. Roginsky\u2019s lawsuit or Ms. Walsh\u2019s news conference. Ms. Walsh, speaking in Los Angeles, repeated the account she provided to The Times. She said that Mr. O\u2019Reilly did not follow through on a verbal offer to make her a contributor to his show after she declined an invitation to go to his hotel suite after a 2013 dinner in Los Angeles that was arranged by his secretary. She has not received a settlement and said she does not want any money. She did not report her complaints to Fox News at the time, she said, because she did not want to jeopardize her career prospects. \u201cOther women who are under gag orders, who cannot talk, they have been silenced,\u201d Ms. Walsh said while seated next to her lawyer, Lisa Bloom. \u201cI had to be the voice for them. \u201d Ms. Walsh is recounting her experiences publicly despite receiving a warning on Saturday from Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s lawyer, Fredric S. Newman, demanding that she retract the statements she made to The Times. The letter, obtained by The Times, said that her assertions were \u201cpatently false and highly defamatory\u201d and said to \u201ccease and desist all defamation of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s character. \u201d \u201cYour segment was a failure,\u201d Mr. Newman wrote. \u201cThat is established as matter of undisputable fact in the    analysis of your segment, which showed that the segment was unsuccessful. \u201d Fox News\u2019s troubles continued when Ms. Roginsky filed her suit in New York State Supreme Court. The suit echoes the complaints that other women have made about Mr. Ailes and the culture at the network, where women have said they faced harassment and feared reporting it. Ms. Roginsky\u2019s lawyer is Nancy Erika Smith, the same lawyer who represented Ms. Carlson, who received a $20 million settlement after leaving the network. Ms. Roginsky, who has been a paid contributor on Fox News since 2011, stated in her complaint that Mr. Ailes made sexist comments and unwanted sexual advances toward her during    meetings in his office, including requiring that she \u201cbend down to kiss him hello\u201d when he sat in a low armchair and telling her that they would get into \u201cso much trouble\u201d if he took her \u201cout for a drink. \u201d Mr. Ailes also would tell her that she should \u201cengage in sexual relationships with \u2018older, married, conservative men,\u2019\u201d the suit stated. Ms. Roginsky asserted in the suit that she faced retaliation for refusing Mr. Ailes\u2019s advances. She said that she was denied a permanent position as a host on the program \u201cThe Five\u201d and was rarely allowed to host her own segments on the show \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d unlike other panelists. She also stated that she was punished for not joining \u201cTeam Roger\u201d when Ms. Carlson filed suit last summer  \u2014   a reference, presumably, to a group of Fox News employees who publicly supported Mr. Ailes. Susan R. Estrich, a lawyer for Mr. Ailes, said that he \u201cvociferously denies\u201d the allegations in Ms. Roginsky\u2019s suit. She called the assertions \u201chogwash\u201d and said that the suit was a \u201ccopycat complaint. \u201d \u201cHer interactions with Mr. Ailes were not even close to the fictional version she wants people to believe now,\u201d Ms. Estrich said in a statement. The developments raised new questions about the internal investigation at Fox News that was started after allegations about Mr. Ailes first became public. In the suit, Ms. Roginsky also stated that she discussed her complaints in a meeting with Mr. Shine and another top network executive during a meeting in November, months after Mr. Ailes was dismissed in July.'"}, "time": 1742563342.7708383}
