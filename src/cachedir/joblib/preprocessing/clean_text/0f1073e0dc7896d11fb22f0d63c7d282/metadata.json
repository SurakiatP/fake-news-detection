The changes have come as the city deals with two investigations involving its officers: a widening sex scandal and a series of racist text messages sent within the department. \u201cAs the mayor of Oakland, I am here to run a police department, not a frat house,\u201d Mayor Libby Schaaf said at a news conference on Friday. The sex scandal unfurled after the suicide of one of the department\u2019s officers last fall. An    woman has since alleged in several media reports that she had sex with that officer and several others from Oakland and other police departments in the area, including some while she was a minor. \u201cWe continue to be disgusted and outraged by the idea that anyone could abuse an underage victim of sexual exploitation,\u201d Ms. Schaaf said in a statement on June 11. The police department\u2019s former chief, Sean Whent, resigned on June 9. Mr. Whent\u2019s resignation was \u201ca personal choice, which we respect,\u201d said Ms. Schaaf, who then named Ben Fairow the interim chief. Mr. Fairow had previously worked in the department and was serving as deputy chief for the Bay Area Rapid Transit. He lasted five days in the job. \u201cI have just received information that has caused me to lose confidence in Ben Fairow\u2019s ability to lead the Oakland Police Department at this particular moment in time,\u201d the mayor said in a statement on Wednesday, announcing Mr. Fairow\u2019s departure. She did not elaborate on specific reasons for her decision. The department\u2019s assistant chief, Paul Figueroa, was then named acting police chief. That lasted two days: Mr. Figueroa said in a statement on Friday that he was taking leave and would return to the department as a captain. \u201cI feel that this is an appropriate time to place civilian oversight over this police department and to send a very clear message about how serious we are about not tolerating misconduct, unethical behavior, and to root out what is clearly a toxic macho culture,\u201d Ms. Schaaf said, in announcing that the city administrator, Sabrina Landreth, will oversee the department while a national search is conducted for a new chief. The handling of the sex scandal is being reviewed by Oakland\u2019s district attorney and an independent investigator. The Associated Press reported that of the 14 Oakland police officers involved in the sex scandal, two have resigned and three others are on paid leave. Ms. Schaaf said the investigation into racist text messages is not related to the sex scandal or the resignation of Mr. Figueroa. \u201cWe do think it\u2019s relevant to share that the text messages were sent by   officers,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut they are wholly inappropriate and not acceptable from anyone who wears the badge of the Oakland Police Department. \u201d Neither the mayor\u2019s office nor investigators have released the text messages to the public. The mayor would not say how many officers were involved with the text messages, but said the investigation \u201csuggests that it is not as widespread as the sex scandal. \u201d \u201cI want to assure the citizens of Oakland that we are hellbent on rooting out this disgusting culture,\u201d Ms. Schaaf said.'"}, "time": 1742562442.5977464}
