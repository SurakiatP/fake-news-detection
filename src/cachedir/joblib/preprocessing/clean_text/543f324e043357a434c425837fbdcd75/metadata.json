I took a short vacation and now I feel utterly unable to function in normal society. Breakfast should begin slowly and quietly around noon, all sandwiches should be lobster rolls and every day should include some kind of beach excursion. But real life beckons, as it always does. The good news is that real life includes some exciting new TV shows this weekend  \u2014   time to turn our brains toward the television future and embrace what comes next. That\u2019s never really been my strong suit, though, so I\u2019ll also probably rewatch a few episodes of \u201cMad Men,\u201d since I found myself thinking about that show an awful lot in the last few weeks. I can\u2019t help it  \u2014   I still miss it. Have a joyous weekend, friends. \u201cThe Hindenburg Explodes! ,\u201d Adult Swim (free, but it\u2019s only up until Monday select it from the \u201cNow Showing\u201d   menu). Watch if you wish \u201cChildren\u2019s Hospital\u201d was set on a doomed airship. Adult Swim has posted four pilots for new, short shows  \u2014   three cartoons and one   piece. The   \u201cHindenburg,\u201d   by and   Rob Corddry, is the best of the bunch. John Cho, Lauren Lapkus, Leslie Bibb, Nate Corddry, Kevin McDonald and Danny Pudi among others play passengers, time travelers, \u201cadventurers\u201d and historical figures on this silly, occasionally crass, spoof. It\u2019s not clear how exactly the show would be expanded past these 10 minutes, but let\u2019s try to believe that we live in a world full of good surprises. \u201cThe Jim Gaffigan Show,\u201d Sunday, 10 p. m. TV Land. Watch if you like loosely autobiographical showbiz stories. \u201cThe Jim Gaffigan Show\u201d has improved tremendously since its premiere last year, finding a little more edge and identity  \u2014   though perhaps we have hit full cultural saturation on \u201ccomic plays comic in show about him or herself. \u201d This week brings the series\u2019   season finale, and the show works just fine episodically. Don\u2019t feel a need to \u201ccatch up,\u201d but if you want to orient yourself a little, watch the surprisingly profound Season 2 episode, \u201cThe Calling,\u201d in which Jim searches for meaning in his life. \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d \u201cThe Tick\u201d and \u201c  Van Johnson,\u201d Amazon.  Watch if you want to participate in the voting process or already like the creators and stars of these shows. Welcome to another round of Amazon pilots. The streaming platform\u2019s \u201csystem,\u201d in which viewer votes allegedly affect which shows go to series, ultimately seems as capricious and   as the old network model: This spring, the platform introduced one compelling and one snoozy drama, \u201cThe Interestings\u201d and \u201cThe Last Tycoon. \u201d And yet \u201cTycoon\u201d is the one that\u2019s moving forward. Alas! The world is cruel. But \u201cI Love Dick\u201d is pretty great. It\u2019s based on Chris Kraus\u2019s book of the same name, and (broadly) adapted by Jill Soloway, the creator of \u201cTransparent. \u201d Soloway teams with her frequent muse Kathryn Hahn, who plays a stymied filmmaker spending a season in Marfa, Tex. with her academic husband (Griffin Dunne) when she meets the alluring, confounding Dick (Kevin Bacon, almost comically eroticized). Soloway\u2019s loose, empathetic style and passion for slightly irritating characters are in full force. But \u201cDick\u201d is less languid than \u201cTransparent,\u201d and has a steadier beat than her film \u201cAfternoon Delight. \u201d Here\u2019s hoping it goes to series. \u201cThe Tick\u201d is the newest reboot in the cult \u201cTick\u201d franchise  \u2014   first a comic book, then an animated series, then a   series and now another   series. This version stars Peter Serafinowicz as the titular superhero, and Griffin Newman (\u201cVinyl\u201d) as Arthur, a dweeby accountant who becomes the Tick\u2019s sidekick. Originalists will probably grumble about this darker spin\u2019s lack of camp and flair, but there\u2019s plenty to like here, even with so many   options. Finally, \u201c  Van Johnson,\u201d starring   Van Damme as an   star who moonlights as a secret operative, did absolutely nothing for me, but if you are a JCVD   your mileage will almost certainly vary. Enjoy an   summer blockbuster from the near comfort of your A. C. unit with \u201cMission: Impossible  \u2014   Rogue Nation. \u201d In this latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d edition, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes under the radar to try to thwart yet another covert organization bent on destroying his colleagues at the Impossible Mission Force (IMF). Boasting incredible stunts, car chases, explosions and a talented cast that includes Alec Baldwin, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson, the fifth movie in the franchise pushes the boundaries of   feats at every turn. You don\u2019t need to have seen previous installments of this spy caper series\u2019 to enjoy \u201cRogue Nation. \u201d But remember to breathe during the movie\u2019s excruciating underwater scene and daredevil plane sequence. (Watch on Amazon Prime)  \u2014   Monica Castillo \u2018The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore\u2019 Comedy Central announced this week that Thursday would be the final night for \u201cThe Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore. \u201d Based on the ratings, this isn\u2019t a huge surprise  \u2014   the show never found a big audience. It also never quite found its ideal form: While Wilmore\u2019s openers were sharp, they often covered the same clips as \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d had a   earlier, and   panel conversations are the worst possible format for telling jokes or conveying information. Here\u2019s hoping there\u2019s another, better show in Wilmore\u2019s future. He spoke with The New York Times earlier this week about the abrupt end to the show and the work he\u2019s most proud of. I\u2019ve raved about this doc in the newsletter a lot, but, all five parts of ESPN\u2019s fascinating, fantastic documentary \u201cO. J. Simpson: Made in America\u201d are now streaming on Hulu.'"}, "time": 1742563529.6440778}
