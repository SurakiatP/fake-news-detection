States should ignore the DHS bluster, stand their ground and continue their refusal to implement this unconstitutional national ID program. \\n\\nREAL ID essentially coopts the states into creating a national ID system. The federal government has no constitutional authority to mandate a national ID. \\n\\nThe federal government repeats this song and dance every couple of years, and has done so since Pres. George W. Bush signed REAL ID into law in 2005. Instead of following through on threats the feds simply keep extending their deadlines. \\n\\nUnder the law, all 50 states were supposed comply with the federal law by 2009. But, states rebelled against REAL ID for several reasons, including privacy concerns and the fact that Congress didn\u2019t provide any funding for the mandates it expects states to implement. Some states passed laws expressly prohibiting implementation of the act.'"}, "time": 1742562510.5277655}
