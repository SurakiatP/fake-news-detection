[The Post tried a   hit on White House strategist (and former Breitbart News executive) Steve Bannon, describing a hostile meeting between him and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly that didn\u2019t actually happen.   As the Washington Post\u2019s editors eventually admitted, reporter Josh Rogin went with the same sort of anonymous sourcing that has produced so many Fake News debacles since the election, without contacting the White House to verify the account.  According to the original story, Secretary Kelly wanted to \u201cissue a waiver for lawful permanent residents, a. k. a.   holders, from the seven   countries whose citizens had been banned from entering the United States,\u201d but Bannon \u201cwanted to stop Kelly in his tracks and told him not to issue the order. \u201d A battle royale supposedly ensued: The disagreement between Bannon and Kelly pitted a political operator against a military disciplinarian. Two administration officials gave the following account of their exchange: Respectfully but firmly, the retired general told Bannon that despite his high position in the White House and close relationship with President Trump, the former Breitbart chief was not in Kelly\u2019s chain of command. If the president wanted Kelly to back off from issuing the waiver, Kelly would have to hear it from the president directly, he told Bannon. It was only a matter of hours before an editorial correction was appended to that paragraph, and acknowledged at the top of the article: White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Kelly and Bannon spoke on Jan. 27 and 29, but denied they had a confrontation over the green card waiver. In an email sent late Saturday, Bannon also denied a confrontation with Kelly and said he had not told him to withhold the waiver. Spicer didn\u2019t merely deny the confrontation he told the Huffington Post it was a \u201cpatently false,   story,\u201d and said the Washington Post\u2019s failure to seek White House comment before publishing the article was \u201cunbelievably unprofessional. \u201d \u201cPrior to publication of this column, The Post sought comment from the Department of Homeland Security but not from the White House. We should have done both. The article has been updated,\u201d editor Fred Hiatt conceded, in a notice that now appears at the top of the piece. \u201cI think we got things wrong in this column. That\u2019s why we published an editor\u2019s note and a correction. I regret getting things wrong. We try really hard not to, but we do make mistakes. And when we make mistakes, we try to correct them and be transparent to the readers what we got wrong,\u201d Hiatt told the Huffington Post. On February 7th, Mediaite quoted Secretary Kelly dismissing the Washington Post piece as a \u201cfantasy story,\u201d and throwing in some harsh words for reporter Josh Rogin. \u201cEvery paragraph, every sentence, every word, every space, every comma, every period is wrong. It was a fantasy story,\u201d Kelly told Rep. Kathleen Rice ( ) when she asked if he was worried about pressure from White House political operatives. \u201cThis reporter, whoever he is, got it so wrong that\u2019s assuming he\u2019s not making it up,\u201d Kelly added. The Secretary of Homeland Security proceeded to emphasize that \u201cI work for one man. His name is Donald Trump. He has told me one thing: Secure the border. \u201d The Washington Post article was a lengthy discourse on debates that really are occurring within the Trump administration, over a policy that has generated much debate among the public. It would have worked just fine without the disputed anecdote, but then it would have lacked the \u201cWhite House political operators bullying Cabinet officials\u201d angle.  (Especially this particular White House political operative, Bannon, having assumed totemic stature among adversarial media, and adversarial media having returned from an   hiatus on the morning of November 9th, 2016.) The Post\u2019s failure to consult the people actually involved in the alleged showdown between Bannon and Kelly is cast in an especially poor light by the speed of the administration\u2019s response to their post. How can reporters and editors justify not even trying to solicit a comment from the White House on an explosive story from anonymous sources? Contrary to Hiatt\u2019s statement to the Huffington Post, his team didn\u2019t \u201ctry really hard\u201d not to get this one wrong. Also, as the Huffington Post observed, that little story about the row between Bannon and Kelly zoomed around cyberspace many times before the corrections were made. In the Internet era, it\u2019s more critical than ever to get the story right the first time. Fake News gets thousands of Retweets, while the corrections get hundreds at best.  Isn\u2019t that precisely the point mainstream media apologists made, when they launched their crusade against Fake News from alternative outlets? Didn\u2019t they boast of their superior reporting and editorial standards as vital tools for successfully pursuing the truth in a time of   disinformation? Perhaps the road to recovery could begin with more healthy skepticism toward stories pushed by anonymous sources who might be nursing grudges against the new administration.
