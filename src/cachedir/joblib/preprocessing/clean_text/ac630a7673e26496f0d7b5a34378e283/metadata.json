SANGER November 13, \" NYT \" - WASHINGTON \\x97 President-elect Donald J. Trump said Friday that he was likely to abandon the American effort to support \\x93moderate\\x94 opposition groups in Syria who are battling the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying \\x93we have no idea who these people are.\\x94\\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal that dealt largely with economic issues, including his willingness to retain parts of the Affordable Care Act, he repeated a position he took often during his campaign: that the United States should focus on defeating the Islamic State, and find common ground with the Syrians and their Russian backers.\\n\\x93I\\x92ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria,\\x94 Mr. Trump told The Journal. \\x93My attitude was you\\x92re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting ISIS, and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria.\\x94\\nHis comments suggest that once Mr. Trump begins overseeing both the public support for the opposition groups, and a far larger covert effort run by the Central Intelligence Agency, he may wind down or abandon the effort. But there are in fact two wars going on simultaneously in Syria.\\nOne is against the Islamic State, in which the United States is supporting 30,000 Syrian-Kurdish and Syrian-Arab fighters, who last weekend announced they were opening a new phase of the battle, beginning to encircle the ISIS capital in Raqqa. There are roughly 300 United States Special Operations forces on the ground assisting these militia.\\nThe second effort is in support of rebels fighting Mr. Assad. The C.I.A. covert program is by far the largest conduit of support, providing antitank missiles to rebels fighting the government. That is the program that Mr. Trump seems most intent on ending. If the United States pursues that line, \\x93We end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria,\\x94 Mr. Trump told The Journal.\\nThe argument for ending the support may be bolstered by the fact that, as a matter of survival, those opposition groups have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria, formerly known as Al Nusra. This has had the effect of allowing Mr. Assad and Russia to argue that they are attacking Al Qaeda, and the United States should aid them in that effort. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that argument during his ultimately failed effort to reach a deal for a cease-fire and an ultimate settlement.\\nMr. Trump\\x92s the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend logic is consistent with what he said during the campaign. \\x93I\\x92m not saying Assad is a good man, \\x91cause he\\x92s not,\\x94 he told The New York Times in an interview in March, \\x93but our far greater problem is not Assad, it\\x92s ISIS.\\x94\\nBut it also takes a position that will gratify President Vladimir V. Putin, because it suggests that rather than pressure Russia to end its support of Mr. Assad, a Trump administration will get out of Mr. Putin\\x92s way.\\nIn another hint of a major change in policy, one of Mr. Trump\\x92s primary national security advisers, Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, the retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, wrote in The Hill newspaper this week that the United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen who Turkey has demanded should be sent back from his exile in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed him for a coup attempt over the summer.\\nThe Justice Department has not yet concluded that there is any convincing evidence that Mr. Gulen should be sent back to almost certain confinement or execution under an extradition treaty with the United States. They see the request as part of Mr. Erdogan\\x92s effort to eliminate all opposition.\\nMr. Flynn adopted many of Turkey\\x92s arguments about Mr. Gulen, arguing that \\x93American taxpayers are helping finance Gulen\\x92s 160 charter schools\\x94 in the United States, and that it is more important to support Turkey than be \\x93hoodwinked by this masked source of terror and instability nestled comfortably in our own backyard.\\x94\\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting. President Assad: Syria is ready to co-operate with Donald Trump : The US is currently enmeshed in a complicated alliance in Syria with Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who would like to provide rebels \\x96 among them al-Qaeda-backed factions \\x96 with surface-to-air missiles. What will Trump do on Syria?: The US should get out of the war in Syria and avoid destabilising more Middle Eastern countries, and the US should work with Putin to defeat terrorist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).'"}, "time": 1742563261.8192804}
