[Visitors to the townhallproject. com website can find everything from detailed information on each scheduled town hall meeting to how to make signs and even specific questions to ask to push the agenda on a range of talking points including: investigating President Donald Trump, Trump\u2019s \u201cstarvation budget\u201d on foreign policy, climate change, supporting illegal aliens, and LGBT rights.  By clicking on the \u201cabout\u201d icon, the first thing that pops up is a quote from Obama\u2019s farewell speech in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017. \u201cIt falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy to embrace the joyous task we\u2019ve been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title:  Citizen,\u201d Obama said. The website states: Town Hall Project empowers constituents across the country to have    conversations with their elected representatives. We are campaign veterans and first time volunteers. We come from a diversity of backgrounds and live across the country. We share progressive values and believe strongly in civic engagement. We research every district and state for public events with members of Congress. Then we share our findings to promote participation in the democratic process. The page also reveals the kind of progressives who are manning the town hall effort by naming its \u201csponsors,\u201d including moveon. org and the Center for American Progress  \u2014   the latter under direction from John Podesta, longtime Obama operative and Hillary Clinton campaign manager. The town hall website links to the websites of both organizations as well as the sponsoring \u201cIndivisible\u201d website, which features a video of Rachel Maddow on MSNBC reporting about the power of the town hall \u201cmovement. \u201d \u201cIf the Tea Party was able to take on a historically popular President Obama with a Democratic supermajority to slow and sometimes defeat his federal agenda, we can surely take on Donald Trump and the members of Congress who would do his bidding,\u201d the Indivisible website states. All three of the sponsors of the Town Hall Project website offer instructions. On the Indivisible website, protesters are told: \u201cYour job isn\u2019t to convince your MoC (member of Congress) of anything. It is to create the political conditions necessary to force them into a new position \u2014  or to replace them. This is a marathon, not a sprint and every mark against them will matter \u2014  especially footage of them flailing in a town hall with you and your group. \u201d The moveon. org instructs protesters on \u201c \u201d lawmakers  \u2014   \u201c  is fun and easy!\u201d  \u2014   the website states.  How to bird dog successfully, states, in part: \u25cf Arrive in advance. \u25cb You want to get a seat close to or in front of the stage or platform to make sure that you have the ability to ask a question and that your MoC can hear you. \u25cb If your group is protesting and is not invited in, make sure you find all the entrances and know where the parking lot is, if applicable, to try to map out the route your MoC will take in and out of the facility, to increase the chances that they see you. \u25cf Don\u2019t give yourself away. \u25cb Do not wear clothing or wave signs that will let people know that you are coming to   your MoC. You want to make sure that you have an opportunity to ask your questions. \u25cf Know your MoC\u2019s positions, \u2022 Study your MoC\u2019s positions on your topic of issues. You want to make sure that they know that you know what you are talking about. Many times, in an attempt to dismiss and discredit, elected officials look for ways to make you seem less informed and thus not qualified to ask your question. However, it is your right as a constituent to ask your question, and being informed will make it harder for you to be dismissed. CAP\u2019s \u201cRecess toolbox\u201d is entitled \u201cResist\u201d and provides questions protesters should ask at town hall meetings:       \u2022 Will you call on President Trump to release his tax returns? We must know whether he\u2019ll profit from the GOP\u2019s tax reform plan. The long list of town halls promoted on the website totals 87 meetings this week for both Republican and Democrat lawmakers across the country. The website also encourages visitors who can\u2019t go to a town hall in person to call their representative, and contact information for members of Congress is provided. \u201cYou have more power than you think,\u201d the website states. \u201cTown halls are one of the most effective ways to use it. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742562499.0142493}
