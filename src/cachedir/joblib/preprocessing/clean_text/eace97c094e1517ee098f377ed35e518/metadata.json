Jeff Sessions a chance to prove himself as the nation\u2019s new attorney general. [\u201cIt seems you ought to give people a chance, unless they\u2019re wholly unqualified,\u201d Holder said during brief remarks at the University at Buffalo, on Thursday. \u201cHe may end up surprising us and he maybe will say, \u2018This is who I always was,\u2019 and I may end up saying, \u2018Well I\u2019ve seen growth then,\u2019\u201d Holder added.  Holder added he plans to be \u201cvery sparing in my criticisms because I know how tough the job is, I know how tough the decisions are,\u201d though he worried Sessions will cross \u201cred lines\u201d on voting rights. According to the Buffalo News, Holder also urged his    audience to avoid \u201cideological blindness\u201d along with \u201cdangerous complacency. \u201d Holder did not oppose Sessions\u2019 nomination despite furious objections from Democrats.'"}, "time": 1742562763.0568242}
