[Barghouti, who is serving five life terms for the murder of Israelis and a Christian monk, was initially described by the NYT only as \u201ca Palestinian leader and parliamentarian. \u201d  Barghouti is also an architect of the deadly Second Palestinian Intifada, or terrorist war responsible for the deaths of scores of Israeli civilians.  Following public outrage, the newspaper added the following editor\u2019s note to the oped: This article explained the writer\u2019s prison sentence but neglected to provide sufficient context by stating the offenses of which he was convicted. They were five counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization. Mr. Barghouti declined to offer a defense at his trial and refused to recognize the Israeli court\u2019s jurisdiction and legitimacy. Ostensibly, Barghouti penned the article to explain why he launched a hunger strike among Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, claiming abuse by prison guards, including his own claim of being kicked in the genitals. Barghouti served as chief of the Tanzim armed wing of Fatah and the founder of terror group the   Martyrs Brigade. In 2004, he was found guilty of ordering terror attacks in three different locations and was implicated in a further four. At the time, the Washington Post reported, \u201cthe   panel said there was insufficient evidence to prove Barghouti\u2019s guilt in another 21 deaths that were originally part of the indictment. [ ]Israeli Justice Minister Yosef Lapid said, however, that the verdict \u2018demonstrates the independence of the Israeli courts. The fact that in most of the accusations he was found not guilty is clear evidence that his case was given a fair trial. \u2019\u201d Lapid\u2019s son, Yesh Atid party leader Yair Lapid, wrote an oped in the Times of Israel claiming that the New York Times was guilty of \u201cintentional deception\u201d by failing to provide a full biography of Barghouti. \u201cAnyone who reads the column without prior knowledge of the facts will come to the conclusion that Barghouti is a freedom fighter imprisoned for his views. Nothing is further from the truth. The missing part of the column is that Marwan Barghouti is a murderer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe attempt by the New York Times \u2018to be balanced\u2019 amuses Barghouti. He understands that this sacred attempt at balance creates equal standing between murderer and murdered, terrorist and victim, lie and truth,\u201d added Lapid. Former Israeli ambassador to Washington Michael Oren slammed the NYT for publishing \u201ca journalistic terror attack\u201d that \u201cwas full of lies. \u201d Former U. S. ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s debatable if Marwan Barghouti has a political future. Pals  Israelis debate it. But NYT was wrong not cite his terrorism conviction. \u201d The Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) responsible for civilian issues in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, also slammed the paper for failing to point out that \u201cBarghouti is a murderer of Israeli civilians. \u201d \u201cBy referring to him only as a political figure, the Times failed to point out that after a fair trial in 2004, Barghouti was convicted of murder and carrying out terrorist acts and was therefore sentenced to five life sentences and an additional 40 years in prison,\u201d a post on COGAT\u2019s Facebook page read. The American Jewish Committee tweeted that the NYT \u201cmust have forgotten to mention that Marwan Barghouti is a convicted terrorist, responsible for the murder of innocent civilians. \u201d Former presidential adviser Elliot Abrams wrote that the NYT\u2019s omission of Barghouti\u2019s history was \u201ca shameful abdication of responsibility to readers. \u201d On Tuesday, New York Times\u2019s public editor Liz Spayd criticized the newspaper for failing to note Barghouti\u2019s crimes. \u201cI see no reason to skimp on this, while failing to do so risks the credibility of the author and the   pages,\u201d Spayd wrote. The piece was titled, \u201cAn   Author Omits His Crimes, and The Times Does Too. \u201d Barghouti launched a mass hunger strike on Monday to coincide with Palestinian \u201cPrisoners Day,\u201d a day of solidarity with more than 6, 000 Palestinian terrorists incarcerated in Israeli jails. The goal of the hunger strike is supposedly to improve prison conditions. Demands include resuming a second monthly visit by family members (originally cancelled by the International Committee of the Red Cross over budgetary concerns) restoring academic studies for prisoners, and allowing additional TV channels and cell phones in security wings.'"}, "time": 1742563782.611153}
