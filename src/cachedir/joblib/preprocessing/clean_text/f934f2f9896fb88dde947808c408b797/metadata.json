Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that 300,000 troops have now been placed in a state of \u201chigh alert\u201d in order to deter Russia who, according to NATO, has been \u201cmuch more active in many different ways.\u201d This new activity includes \u201cRussia using propaganda in Europe among NATO allies,\u201d which Stoltenberg says is \u201cexactly the reason why NATO is responding [\u2026] with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War.\u201d Adam Thomson, an outgoing representative to NATO, has estimated that the new 300,000 troops would be capable of deploying within 180 days, adding that speeding up the speed of deployment is of great importance. Though \u201cpropaganda\u201d was cited as the main reason for the latest NATO build-up against Russia, the measures also come on the heels of Russia\u2019s alleged involvement in \u201ccyber attacks\u201d on the US, despite no concrete evidence, as well as the nuclear war drills it has held domestically. In addition, NATO accused Moscow of deliberately provoking NATO by sending hundreds of paratroopers to a Serbian airbase, just 150 miles from where NATO forces were involved in disaster relief exercises in Montenegro. In response, Igor Sutyagin, an expert at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies told the UK\u2019s Sunday Express that if \u201cRussia wants to show that it can intimidate NATO, NATO saying to Russia, \u201cIf you show up, we\u2019ll be there as well.\u201d Frankly, all of these latest accusations coming from NATO are completely absurd. For one thing, the accusation that Russia was involved in \u201ccyber attacks\u201d or recent hacks is admittedly based on speculation by various US intelligence officials as no concrete evidence has been found to date implicating the Russians. In addition, the statement that said US Intelligence was \u201cconfident\u201d Russia was responsible due to such speculation was authored by James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence who lied to Congress under oath regarding NSA surveillance. If Clapper lied to the Congress once, what\u2019s to stop him from lying to the American people? Furthermore, NATO are the clear aggressors here as they have been carrying out an unprecedented build-up on Russia\u2019s border since 2014, placing numerous troops and military hardware in close proximity to Russia as well as carrying out massive military drills. This, along with this newly announced escalation and the rise of neo-McCarthyism in the West, has convinced many, including Russians, that NATO and the West are preparing for a full-scale war against Russia. However, most ridiculous of all is that this latest NATO announcement of troop deployment was spurred by the use of so-called Russian \u201cpropaganda,\u201d a clear attack on news outlets related to Russia such as RT and Sputnik. RT has already been feeling the heat as their UK branch had its bank accounts closed without warning. Though Russia\u2019s supposed use of \u201cpropaganda\u201d prompts a military response from NATO, the US and the West have suffered no consequence for its own obvious use of propaganda against Russia and its allies, including this TIME magazine cover . Propaganda was once illegal within the US, but the passage of the 2012 NDAA changed all that, meaning that the West is also definitely using propaganda. Where\u2019s the outrage? The fact that NATO\u2019s narrative is so blatantly one-sided should be enough proof to us all that there\u2019s more to the story than NATO is letting on.\""}, "time": 1742562804.3136692}
