Nygard has been in and out of court over the years, and despite a short-lived victory last October, he was recently back in front of a judge facing a contempt of court charge for refusing a court order to remove the turbines from his property. \\nHe did eventually remove the turbines, leaving only the cement bases because removing them would cause structural damage to their house. This was not good enough for the local government, who ignored the advice of three different engineers and demanded that they remove the bases, despite the risk of damaging the home. This is all that remains of the windmill on Nygard\u2019s property, a concrete footing, in the ground. \\nOn Friday, Nygard was arrested and, according to his son, has been given six months in prison for refusing to remove the base. \\nAccording to Kahler Nygard, Jay\u2019s son, his father even attempted to make peace with the county and compromise on a number of different issues, but they ignored his appeals. \\n\u201cThe choices for my dad were to potentially destroy our foundation in the house or go to jail, he even offered an olive branch saying he would add an easement to the deed saying when the house is demolished the pad must be removed, but that was ignored also, \u201d Kahler said in an exclusive interview with The Free Thought Project. \\n\u201cThe base was level with the ground and 4 feet cubed. We removed the top half of the concrete and used a metal cutting tool to remove the top half of the bolt assembly, rendering the structure unusable,\u201d Kahler explained. \\n\u201cThey say that we have to remove to footing 100% and have it inspected by the city, which we have three different engineers all saying we should just leave it , one of them even does contract work for the city, \u201d he added. \\nKahler said that although there are no ordinances against windmills, the county has a personal vendetta against his family. \\nNygard has the right to do whatever he wants with his own property, but unfortunately in a democracy such as the United States, the property rights of an individual can be overridden according to the whims of politicians and the demands of uninvolved third parties. \\nPlease share this story with your friends and family in hopes of keeping a good man, whose only \u201ccrime\u201d was self-sustainability, out of jail. \\nJohn Vibes is an author, researcher and investigative journalist who takes a special interest in the counter-culture and the drug war.
