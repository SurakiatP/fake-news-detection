S. Capitol complex. [Breitbart News previously reported that the painting was hung in the Capitol complex after Clay chose it as a fitting representation of the August 9, 2014, shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. It depicts police officers as animals with tusks.  On January 6 Hunter removed the painting from the wall, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the press [reporting on this painting] for about a week or so.   \u2026     I\u2019m in the Marine Corps. If you want it done, just call us. \u201d Hunter then delivered the painting to Clay\u2019s office and said, \u201cLacy can put it back up, I guess, if he wants to   \u2026     but I\u2019m allowed to take it down. \u201d Clay now wants \u201ctheft\u201d charges against Hunter. According to The Washington Post, Clay addressed the removal of the painting on Monday, saying that \u201chis staff met Monday with members of the Capitol Police to press theft charges against Rep. Duncan D. Hunter. \u201d Clay added, \u201cHe had no right to take that picture down, it\u2019s thievery. \u201d Clay plans to rehang the   painting on January 10 and will be accompanied by the Congressional Black Caucus while doing it. The artist behind the painting is David Pulphus. Clay defended Pulphus\u2019 animal representation of officers in Ferguson, saying: These are his impressions. Those are his feelings. That\u2019s how he formed his opinion, and he expressed it in his art. So what\u2019s wrong with that? Any black parent would tell you that they have to have this conversation with their children about police and how to act around them, so that\u2019s the conversation we need to be having here. Not about taking some kid\u2019s picture off the wall  \u2014   it should be about, how do we change these attitudes and improve the relationships between police and the black community? The schism between Clay and Hunter over attitudes toward police officers is a microcosm of the larger divide that exists between the Democrat Party and the Republican Party. For example, during the 2016 presidential race the National Fraternal Order of Police (NFOP) sent Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton a questionnaire to answer. She did not even bother returning it to them. NFOP president Chuck Canterbury said he was \u201cdisappointed and shocked. \u201d Approximately a month later the NFOP endorsed Donald Trump for president. The Hill quoted Canterbury saying, \u201c[Trump] has seriously looked at the issues facing law enforcement today. He understands and supports our priorities and our members believe he will make America safe again. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \u201cBullets with AWR Hawkins,\u201d a Breitbart News podcast.
