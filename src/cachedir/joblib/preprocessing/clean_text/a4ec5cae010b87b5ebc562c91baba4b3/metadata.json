Musburger said Olbermann, who used to work alongside Dan Patrick, should get back to sports, where people actually \u201cenjoy him. \u201d \u201cWhen did Keith Olbermann become this progressive that\u2019s out there leading the banner?\u201d Musburger asked. \u201cI think I was looking for Musburger on Google last night and I\u2019d had enough Irish whiskey that I hit the O button and I looked at Olbermann and he\u2019s calling for the president to resign. What\u2019s going on with my guy? I mean, come on. He\u2019s a baseball guy. I want to know how many games the Cubs are going to win next year and he\u2019s out there calling for Mr. Trump to resign. When did this happen?\u201d \u201cHe should get off that soapbox of his and get back to where we enjoy him. I love to listen to him talk baseball,\u201d he added later.
