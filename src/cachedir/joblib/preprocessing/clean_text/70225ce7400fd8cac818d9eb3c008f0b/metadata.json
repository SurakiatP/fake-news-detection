Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched a new website  \u2014   \u201cIce En Espa\u00f1ol. \u201d @ICEEspa\u00f1ol is also now on Twitter. The new media campaign allows officials to distribute information currently being distorted or misreported by some media. [Officials said the \u201cexpanded Spanish language presence   \u2026     is our most recent step in increasing access to important and accurate information about ICE. \u201d The translated website provides press releases, information about ICE and the agency\u2019s mission, and a \u201cDetainee Locator\u201d tab.  ICE released a statement touting \u201cOne of the highlights\u201d of the new forum \u201cis informing   audiences about the important work ICE does, such as combating child exploitation, human trafficking, and fighting transnational gangs. \u201d Moreover, \u201cOffering information in other languages helps ICE communicate across cultures and reach a broader audience, while also ensuring that the public can obtain information directly from ICE, and not from unofficial  \u2014   and possibly unscrupulous  \u2014   sources,\u201d said Liz Johnson, assistant director of public affairs. Breitbart Texas reported in early February that ICE officials were working to combat false reports of checkpoints and ICE raids. \u201cReports of ICE checkpoints and sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible. These reports create mass panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger. Any groups falsely reporting such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support,\u201d the statement provided to Breitbart Texas said. After President Trump was sworn into office and ongoing ICE raids were targeting criminal aliens, media outlets and open borders and amnesty advocates spread fear and false information. The profile on the @ICEEspa\u00f1ol Twitter page calls ICE \u201cthe largest investigative agency at DHS,\u201d and has a link to \u201cReport Suspicious Activity. \u201d There is also a \u201cDetention Reporting and Information Line\u201d (DRIL) a   service to answer questions, and report: The rotating cover on the website details the number of arrests made, and the amount of currency and the number of firearms seized. The site also has a section that provides access to its \u201cDeclined Detainer Outcome Report( s),\u201d a weekly report that exposes sanctuary cities and their release of criminals subject to detainers. The report was mandated by President Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States. \u201d Texas lead the country in sanctuary city releases, the first edition revealed. As reported by Breitbart Texas in   the report has been temporarily suspended. The agency released a statement that it was working to refine the data reporting process. ICE officials received pushback from some jurisdictions that were incorrectly reported as having released criminal aliens under detainers.
