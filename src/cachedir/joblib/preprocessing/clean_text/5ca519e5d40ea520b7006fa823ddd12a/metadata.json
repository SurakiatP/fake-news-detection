Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry by a   previously deported illegal alien could have been prevented, says the agent\u2019s brother Kent Terry in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas. Terry\u2019s family hopes the Trump Administration will now go after \u201cthe real criminals\u201d responsible for putting the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d guns in the accused killer\u2019s hands. [A task force including Mexican law enforcement officials, U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and U. S. Border Patrol Border Patrol BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agents arrested accused killer Heraclio   in Mexico earlier this week, Breitbart Texas reported. Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas stated immigration officials deported   seven times before he returned illegally on December 14, 2010, as part of a Mexican bandit \u201crip crew. \u201d The accused killer of Agent Terry opened fire on the BORSTAR team in southern Arizona that had been dispatched to find the \u201crip crew\u201d which had been robbing other drug and human smuggling convoys in the area.  \u201cWe just heard that Brian\u2019s shooter had been deported seven times,\u201d Brian Terry\u2019s brother, Kent Terry, told Breitbart Texas. \u201cThis is a death that could have been prevented. \u201d The allegation that   shot Agent Terry with a gun supplied by the U. S. Government in a   operation called \u201cFast and Furious\u201d made his death even more painful to the family members. To this date, no U. S. law enforcement official involved in supplying over 2, 000 guns to Mexican drug cartels under this program have been held to account. The House of Representatives found Former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder to be in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents related to the Fast and Furious program, Breitbart News reported in June 2012. Seventeen House Democrats joined with the Republican majority in finding Holder in contempt. \u201cBob, this arrest puts us another step closer to getting those accountable for Brian\u2019s senseless death that could have been prevented,\u201d Kent Terry explained. \u201cBut the real criminals that President Trump and Attorney General Sessions need to look at are Eric Holder, Thomas Brandon, Bill Newell, and the rest who started this scandal known as Fast and Furious. \u201d \u201cMr. Trump promised me he would open the books in Brian\u2019s death and now is the time,\u201d an exasperated Kent Terry stated. \u201cMy family has waited long enough. In the meantime, I will continue to fight for Brian and Zapata. \u201d U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata was also killed by Mexican cartel members using weapons obtained through the Fast and Furious Program.  \u201cOur family is extremely happy to hear of the capture of one of the subjects involved in Brian\u2019s murder,\u201d Terry\u2019s sister, Michelle   told Breitbart Texas. \u201cThis is just another step forward toward getting the justice he truly deserves. \u201d \u201cWe want to express our gratitude to the Mexican officials and all the divisions of our US law enforcement that made this apprehension possible,\u201d Michelle expressed. She sends a special thank you to Brian\u2019s brothers in green who are part of the elite BORTAC team that assisted in the apprehension of this suspect. \u201d \u201cThe Terry family continues the fight to bring those held accountable for the botched gun program fast n furious that killed my brother and to honor him through the Brian Terry Foundation that was established to honor his legacy,\u201d she said, echoing Kent\u2019s call for justice. Brian Terry\u2019s third sibling, Kelly   also expressed her gratitude to all involved in bringing Brian\u2019s accused killer to justice. \u201cI would like to thank every person involved from day one in the search and apprehension of the latest suspect,\u201d Kelly expressed. \u201cIt does not go unnoticed that they put their lives at risk for this mission to be successful. We are closer to justice for Brian. \u201d \u201cThis latest news gave us more hope than we have had in awhile,\u201d she said cautiously. \u201cMy guard is still up with this new administration because of all the lies and   from the previous one, but I more optimistic and hopeful than I have been in six years. Brian cannot and will not be forgotten. \u201d Nearly one year ago,   candidate Donald Trump met with the Terry family about their brother\u2019s murder, Breitbart Texas reported. \u201cHe told us how sorry he was about Brian\u2019s senseless death,\u201d Kent Terry told this reporter after the meeting. \u201cMr. Trump said it was shameful on this administration for starting a scandal like this and shameful for what they\u2019re doing about it. \u201d \u201cHe also is very sincere about Brian\u2019s death. Yes, he promised us if he becomes president, he will open the books on Fast and Furious. \u201d The Terry family believes it is now time for President Trump and the Republican led Congress do deliver on their promises.
