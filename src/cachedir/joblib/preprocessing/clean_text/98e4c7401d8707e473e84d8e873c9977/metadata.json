[The event, which is scheduled to take place in April, was organized by the nonpartisan student political group BridgeCal and the university\u2019s College Republican group. Plans include a talk on immigration followed by a    session. It will also be sponsored by the Young America\u2019s Foundation, who will pay the majority of Coulter\u2019s $20, 000 speaking fee.  SNOWFLAKES BEWARE: We\u2019re sending @AnnCoulter to Berkeley on April 27. Details to come. #YAFonCampus pic. twitter.   \u2014   YAF (@yaf) March 28, 2017,  However, one of the event\u2019s organizers, Pranav Jandahyala, told CBS San Francisco that the group are \u201cpretty apprehensive right now about everything,\u201d but \u201ctruly believe [they] can put on a great event. \u201d The rioting before Yiannopoulos\u2019s event in February received worldwide attention, as   anarchists destroyed campus property smashed local ATMs and bank windows looted a Starbucks attacked Trump supporters   innocent individuals and set fires in the street. Others spray painted the words \u201cKill Trump\u201d on storefronts. This time, however, organizers plan to provide more robust security, to honor the tradition of free speech at Berkeley since the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s. \u201cThis time we are definitely going to push them to provide more security than they did last time. More officers on the ground instead of in the balcony,\u201d Jandahyala said. In a statement, UC Berkeley said that Coulter\u2019s invitation \u201cin no way suggests our endorsement of a particular point of view, and we will continue to affirm our commitment to the values of diversity, equality, and tolerance that underlie the greatness of Berkeley and, indeed, of our nation. \u201d However, the university did reaffirm its commitment to free speech, stating that it does not prohibit events \u201cbased on a generalized concern that a speaker\u2019s message may trigger disruptions. \u201d Jandahyala also added that the event will be a chance to ignite heated discussions, where attendees will have the opportunity to challenge Coulter\u2019s views. \u201cSo what I challenge you to do is actually confront her. If she comes to speak on campus and there\u2019s no challenge to her viewpoint and people resort to violence and maybe she doesn\u2019t speak, her views go unchallenged,\u201d he continued.
