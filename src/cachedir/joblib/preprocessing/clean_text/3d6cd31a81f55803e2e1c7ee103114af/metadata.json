[The columnist at the Detroit Free Press writes, \u201cPresidents mostly use it to boost their popularity. Teams use it to boost their legacy. It started as a nicety, but playing nice is not very fashionable these days. \u201d  The tradition originated in 1865 when Andrew Johnson welcomed the Brooklyn Atlantics and Washington Nationals baseball teams. The Atlantics, founded in 1855 in Brooklyn NY, became one of the top teams during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. They were considered the National Champions in 1864 and 1865. Although other teams made their way to the White House sporadically over the next century, Ronald Reagan in the 1980s began inviting winning teams after every season. Unfortunately, the occasion has now become an opportunity for athletes to draw attention to themselves by boycotting the presidential meeting for political reasons. This year the White House protests involve President Donald Trump, who campaigned on legal immigration, strong national security, and the eradication of Islamic terrorism. These are not values supported by several of the Patriots players who see Trump\u2019s vision as exclusive, xenophobic, and racist. \u201cI don\u2019t feel accepted in the White House,\u201d defensive back Devin McCourty gave as his reason for not visiting the 45th president of the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\u201d running back LeGarrette Blount echoed to NFL host Rich Eisen. Patriots linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower simply stated, \u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d referring to his visits to the White House as a college player, when he was an   and   national champion at Alabama.  Certainly, boycotting Trump \u201cis surely their right to do so as Americans,\u201d says Albom. \u201cIt is also rude,\u201d he adds.  Albom points out that visiting the White House isn\u2019t an endorsement of its current occupant. \u201cAnd taking a photo with your nation\u2019s elected leader doesn\u2019t mean you surrender your right to disagree with every single thing he does,\u201d he reminds us. America has changed, argues Albom. \u201cWe live in a world where declaring is easier than doing, and Twitter posts pass for social action. So turning down an invitation  \u2014   by tweeting or doing an interview  \u2014    gets you celebrated. You don\u2019t need to actually do anything to make the country better. You don\u2019t even need to leave the couch. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562184.3083906}
