That show is a show I was born to do,\u201d she told the New York Times while promoting her Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly show, which could not even beat a 60 Minutes rerun in its debut. Kelly made similar comments at NBC\u2019s upfront presentations last month. She bluntly told Politico during her round of interviews, \u201cI was not born to be a political news anchor. \u201d \u201cThe audience enjoyed the show and I\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d she said of her Fox News primetime show. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t who I was and it isn\u2019t who I am. \u201d Kelly told the Daily Beast that cable news offers \u201cno time for wining and dining you gotta get right to it. \u201d Her new show, though, will allow her time for more nuance and relationship building with her guests. Her show, she says, has \u201callowed me to open up more and show more of who I am\u201d and \u201cshow a range of emotion and personality and sides of me that wasn\u2019t possible when I was in   cable news. \u201d Like many others who used their positions at    outlets to get adoration from the mainstream press to eventually land a mainstream media gig, Kelly got the requisite pats on the head from The Opposition Party\u2019s members during the 2016 presidential campaign. Using the prominent platform she somehow got on Fox News, Kelly attacked and attempted to kneecap   Trump, most egregiously during a GOP presidential debate when she took Trump\u2019s comments out of context in order to paint him as a sexist pig. The mainstream media howled their approval. And in hindsight, it seems as if Kelly, who conservatives always suspected was more liberal than she let on, was auditioning for them. As for Trump, Kelly told the Daily Beast that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t say no to a sit down\u201d with him but \u201cit\u2019s not something I am pursuing right now. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to not be at the pointy point of the spear for every news story he generated,\u201d she told the Times. But Kelly said she was excited to do what she feels she was \u201cborn to do. \u201d She told the Daily Beast that she has learned it was \u201cextremely hard to be a    mother. \u201d \u201cI was driving the housekeeper crazy. Poor Carla. Nobody was as happy as Carla was when I went back to work,\u201d she said. When news of NBC\u2019s hiring of Kelly broke, one executive reportedly told CNN that \u201cthe degree of difficulty\u201d would be \u201cextremely high\u201d for Kelly and if she does not succeed, \u201cshe could end up fading into obscurity. \u201d Kelly\u2019s first two programs have failed to beat reruns of 60 Minutes. Her last even lost to a rerun of America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos. NBC News is reportedly \u201cfreaking out\u201d over the \u201cratings disaster\u201d that is Kelly.'"}, "time": 1742561819.2454293}
