Every single attack on @POTUS is really a disguised attack on American voters who rejected   \u2019s bleeding of R treasury.  \u2014   Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) March 20, 2017,  The    Roseanne star  \u2014   whose own 2012 presidential run was the subject of a documentary film  \u2014   frequently praised Trump during the 2016 race and has continued to defend his presidency on social media. In June, the comedian told the Hollywood Reporter that the country would be \u201clucky\u201d if Trump won, \u201cbecause then it wouldn\u2019t be Hillary. \u201d \u201cI like Trump because he financed his own [campaign],\u201d Barr said then. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way he could\u2019ve gotten that nomination. Because nobody wants a president who isn\u2019t from Yale and Harvard and in the club. \u2018Cause it\u2019s all about distribution. When you\u2019re in the club, you\u2019ve got people that you sell to. That\u2019s how money changes hands, that\u2019s how business works. If you\u2019ve got friends there, they scratch your back and blah, blah. \u201d Last week, Barr spoke out after Palestinian activist and Women\u2019s March organizer Linda Sarsour said it is impossible to be both a   Zionist and a feminist. \u201cIs it even possible to be a   feminist?\u201d Barr fired back on Twitter. Barr also announced last week that the cast of her hit 1990s television show was \u201cup for a reunion show. \u201d Roseanne ran for nine seasons between 1988 and 1997 and won three Golden Globe awards.
