Satellite images suggest that among those festivities may be the nation\u2019s sixth nuclear test, which would arrive at a particularly tempestuous time in the relationship between Pyongyang and its largest benefactor, China. [The satellite images in question appeared on the website 38 North this week, dedicated to monitoring North Korean nuclear sites for unusual activity. The outlet warned that the   Nuclear Test Site appeared \u201cprimed and ready\u201d for such a nuclear test due to the amount of water and heat apparently coming out of the facility.  NBC News notes that the day before the 38 North report, Pyongyang \u201cwarned it would strike the U. S. mainland with nuclear weapons at any sign of aggression from Washington. \u201d This, however, is not an unusual occurrence last month, for example, North Korea threatened a nuclear strike on Manhattan. The South Korean newswire service Yonhap reports that their sources within the South Korean military disagreed with the conclusions in the report, saying there had been \u201cno unusual\u201d activity at the site, or any other such nuclear site in the country to their knowledge. \u201cAnother defense official here did not rule out the possibility that the unpredictable North will carry out a nuclear test without special indications spotted, given its past provocation,\u201d the report added. Another report at Voice of America suggested that evidence exists that a \u201cnuclear device\u201d is prepared to launch for Saturday, the \u201cDay of the Sun. \u201d North Korean nuclear officials have \u201capparently placed a nuclear device in a tunnel and it could be detonated Saturday AM Korea time. \u201d An official at the American National Security Council told Voice of America that the NSC \u201cwill be watching closely,\u201d but did not elaborate. North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests, the latest and largest in September. Pyongyang claimed that this test was of a hydrogen bomb  \u2014   an \u201c  of Justice\u201d  \u2014   but nuclear experts disagreed, noting that the blast caused by the bomb was too small to have come from a pure fusion explosion. Experts contended the bomb was likely a   hybrid. North Korea has also revealed the major event for which they corralled the nation\u2019s media last night, and contrary to international suspicions, it was not a nuclear test, but the opening of a new residential area in Pyongyang. According to Yonhap, Kim   personally attended the unveiling of a new neighborhood in Pyongyang, billed as a \u201cbig and important event\u201d to international media present.'"}, "time": 1742562343.3265462}
