Santos was asked about comments Trump made in his remarks when he cited his proposed border wall as an important tool to stop drugs from coming into America.  Santos avoided discussing the wall directly and instead pointed to areas where the U. S. and Colombia were working together. \u201cI believe the best way to fight drug trafficking is by collaborating,\u201d Santos said. \u201cIt is a world problem and we have to all work together. We declared the war on drugs 40 years ago  \u2026     and it\u2019s a war that has not been won, so we must be more effective and more efficient. \u201d He pointed to a number of areas the U. S. and Colombia are working together to fight the international drug trade and said that they had agreed to double down on that commitment in the meeting at the White House. \u201cBy working together we can be much more effective and that was the commitment we ratified this afternoon,\u201d he said. Trump, however, was much more direct in his answer. \u201cThat was a long and a very diplomatic answer to your question,\u201d Trump joked. \u201cI will say it a little bit shorter  \u2014   walls work, just ask Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey work, believe me, they work, and we have no choice. \u201d Trump was referring to the multiple barriers Israel has set up along its border to combat both the influx of terrorists and illegal immigration. Israel\u2019s borders are frequently heralded as proof that such barriers can in fact work.  In January, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted his support of Trump\u2019s policy and pointed to the wall along Israel\u2019s southern border as proof of success. President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel\u2019s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8  \u2014   Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) January 28, 2017,  Adam Shaw is a political reporter for Breitbart News.
