She talked to her friend, in South Carolina, and found the following: \\nWould you look at that? The Democrat ticket of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine is listed twice, with Pacific Green/Progressive of Jill Stein/Ajamu Baraka and Libertarian Gary Johnson/Bill Weld also list. \\nNo Republican ticket of Donald Trump/Mike Pence listed! \\nOthers went online after voting, only to find that their mail in ballots, who listed Donald Trump as their candidate of choice, were not counted, supposedly because the signature on the ballot did not match the signature on the letter! \\nFortunately, these people checked and are taking action before it is too late. \\nThe Clinton Foundation, leftist billionaire George Soros, and the Democrats have power, and they have been shown to be corrupt. \\nDo not let this kind of voter fraud happen to your vote! \\nWe cannot prove, right now, that the system is rigged, but something is not right. \\nMake sure that your vote counts.'"}, "time": 1742562245.8544605}
