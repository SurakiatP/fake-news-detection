Since then, roving vehicles have sent back thousands of fascinating images, all of which are helping scientists to understand whether the Red Planet could have once supported life. But could these 20 images be the only clues they need? From strange skulls to abandoned space stations, these photos have certainly got UFO hunters and conspiracy theorists talking nonstop. 19. Face of an ancient god The Mars Opportunity rover was just going about its business; it didn\u2019t expect to be greeted by the face of the divine. But that\u2019s what happened, or so it seems, with the image it captured bearing more than a passing resemblance to the 2,800-year old Neo-Assyrian god on the right. 18. Lady in the distance This landscape is about as Martian as it gets, but standing on one of those rocks is what appears to be the figure of a woman. \u201cShe\u201d was captured by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover, and website UFO Sightings Daily reckons that the image is proof that there\u2019s life on Mars. 17. A perfect pyramid It looks like something straight from the Libyan Desert, but this isn\u2019t one of the pyramids of Giza. No, this image was taken by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover, with the \u201cpyramid\u201d being roughly as big as a car. Paranormal investigators say it\u2019s proof of alien life; scientists say it\u2019s simply a quirky rock formation. 16. A huge human face This large Martian rock in the planet\u2019s Cydonia region looks like a person\u2019s face \u2013 there\u2019s just no denying it. It was captured during the Viking 1 mission way back in 1976, but NASA scientists were quick to explain that, unfortunately, the \u201cface\u201d was merely a light-and-shadows induced mirage. 15. A thigh bone There\u2019s no getting around this one: it\u2019s obviously a thigh bone, right? Well, when it was captured by the Curiosity rover in 2014, NASA swiftly pointed out that, actually, this was the image of a rock that had been eroded by water. That\u2019 s still quite exciting, as it\u2019s a sign of life; less exciting, though, is the fact that it could equally well have been shaped by wind. 14. Alien skeleton Conspiracy theorists reckon that this shot is proof that aliens once roamed Mars. Their case, on the surface, appears to be strong \u2013 a head and torso can be clearly made out, as can a pair of arms. But who knows what happened to the \u201cskeleton\u201d\u2019s legs? 13. Star Wars spaceship This photo appears to have captured a downed Destroyer in the desolate Martian landscape, which seems crazy given that Star Wars is fictional \u2013 but hey, the camera never lies, right? The image was taken by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover, and UFO experts have been totally captivated by it. 12. Jelly donut Apparently aliens are partial to sweet treats, too. But the weirdest thing about this apparent image of a jelly donut is that one day, it wasn\u2019t there, and then 12 days later, it was. Did NASA\u2019s Opportunity rover miss a careless alien dropping it as it passed by? One concerned citizen even launched a lawsuit against NASA, claiming that they were not investigating this donut-shaped proof of life properly. 11. Alien scorpion Scott C. Waring, a self-titled \u201calien expert\u201d from Taiwan, believes that this image depicts a giant scorpion scuttling across the surface of Mars. The intriguing image was taken by the Curiosity rover in September 2015, and it\u2019s left quite the sting in the tail. 10. Alien peering from a cave Is this a shy alien peering out from its cave? Well, Scott C. Waring certainly believes so. In his YouTube video analysis of NASA coverage, he says, \u201cRight inside this little cave area there is a pink face or a red face sticking out. Is it a living being? Possibly.\u201d 9. Female statue In 2007 the Mars Spirit rover captured this strange image of what appears to be a female statue, though at first glance it also looks remarkably like Bigfoot. The Planetary Society, however, believe that the image is nothing more than a trick of the eye. 8. \u201cMarshenge\u201d Anything Earth can do, in an ancient unexplained monument sense, Mars can do too. This is \u201cMarshenge,\u201d and a YouTuber by the name of Mr. Enigma \u2013 who calls himself an alien hunter \u2013 has said that it looks \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the stone circle in Wiltshire, England. \u201cI\u2019m just saying there is something strange about this area,\u201d he concluded. 7. Crab monster This image, captured by the Curiosity rover, appears to show a crab-like monster emerging from a gap in the rocks. Sadly, however, it\u2019s nothing more than an optical illusion caused by our brains\u2019 habit of recognizing familiar shapes in unfamiliar objects. It\u2019s called pareidolia, and it\u2019s why we often see things that aren\u2019t there. 6. A giant waffle Towards the end of 2014 the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took this photo of an island on Mars\u2019 exterior. What was so interesting about it? Well, it looks like a giant waffle \u2013 one that is 1.2 miles across, in fact. Yet rather than being delicious and edible, it\u2019s believed to have been formed from lava flows breaking out from beneath the planet\u2019s surface. 5. Bigfoot skull If that was Bigfoot earlier, then this may be the skull of one its descendants. It was captured by the Curiosity rover in 2016, and while it got people talking, the \u201cskull\u201d \u2013 which is, somewhat predictably, just a rock \u2013 is really just another example of pareidolia. 4. Mystery dome This strange dome, according to conspiracy theorists, was constructed by an ancient civilization. \u201cIs it possible,\u201d questioned the Unsilent Majority website, \u201cthat we are looking at some sort of building left behind by ancient inhabitants on Mars?\u201d Its existence was uncovered by the Opportunity rover in 2015. 3. The Mars monolith In 2009 the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured what appeared to be a monolith on the surface of Mars. The remarkable image was published to the Lunar Explorer Italia website, which is how people started talking about it. Scientists, however, later said that the monolith was nothing more than a typical Martian boulder. 2. Something shiny In 2012 the Curiosity rover captured a small shiny object somewhere on Mars\u2019 surface. Was it a fragment of alien spacecraft, or a piece of leftover currency? Well, according to NASA scientists the object is merely a part of the Red Planet\u2019s typical geological make-up. It\u2019s no doubt worth a few dollars on eBay, though. 1. Hunk of metal What\u2019s this hunk of metal doing on Mars? It was unearthed by the Curiosity rover in 2013, and when it was published Flickr users tried to enhance it to discover what it was. It\u2019s suggested however, that the object could merely be a fragment of a meteorite or \u2013 even more disappointingly \u2013 a trick of the light. source:'"}, "time": 1742563932.9694602}
