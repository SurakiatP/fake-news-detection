Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. \\n\u201cIt is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,\u201d said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. \u201cIt is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nOutrage is growing over Comey\u2019s actions as details about the FBI investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with Clinton, her emails, or her server. \\nDirector Comey\u2019s motives for sending the letter 11 days before a presidential election have been questioned by both Republicans and Democrats. \\nIf Comey\u2019s actions were politically motivated, he would be in violation of the Hatch Act. \\nWhat Republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy. \\nThe American people deserve a full explanation from Director Comey, because the letter that was released today raises more questions than answers.'"}, "time": 1742563805.4709463}
