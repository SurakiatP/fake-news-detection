But as the nation prepares to choose President Obama\u2019s successor on Tuesday, the bold agenda he described that morning remains incomplete. What Mr. Obama discovered  \u2014   and what his successor will learn  \u2014   is that every presidency lasts for only a brief moment in time. Mr. Obama\u2019s health care bill gave insurance to millions, but he now faces calls for big changes to it. The economy is markedly better, but incomes and growth remain stubbornly low. The immigration overhaul he wanted is tied up in legal limbo, as are his tough new climate rules. Fewer Americans are fighting in overseas wars, but the Islamic State has emerged as a new threat. Partisanship and racial tensions have intensified. \u201cThere is a lot of unfinished business,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader from South Dakota, a longtime supporter of Mr. Obama. \u201cThe satisfaction comes in knowing that he has changed the landscape in a very profound way. The frustration comes in knowing what might have been. \u201d Mr. Obama recognized the transient nature of his tenure when he spoke eight years ago to the ecstatic crowd in Grant Park. \u201cOur climb will be steep,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe may not get there in one year or even one term. \u201d More recently, he has started acknowledging that his legacy will be an incremental one. In an article in The Economist, he described the presidency as \u201ca relay race, requiring each of us to do our part to bring the country closer to its highest aspirations. \u201d Jen Psaki, the White House communications director, said that Mr. Obama had always understood he was part of a continuum. \u201cHe recognizes that who he passes the baton to will have a huge impact on whether you build on the progress he made,\u201d she said. White House aides point to what they call the highlights of that progress: digging the country out of a deep economic recession, rescuing the auto industry, extending health insurance to 20 million people, pressing the world to confront climate change, reducing America\u2019s combat role in two overseas wars. But for a president who won the highest office in the land by promising big, sweeping change, Tuesday\u2019s election is a reminder that it will be up to someone else to complete the change he long envisioned. Health care may be the most important example. Passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 drastically reshaped the insurance markets in the country, improving access to medical care. But even Democrats agree that much more needs to be done to improve the cost and quality of that care. \u201cIf this was a football field, I\u2019d put us on the   line with 70 yards to go,\u201d said Mr. Daschle, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s first pick for secretary of health and human services but withdrew after questions about his taxes. Mr. Daschle said the unfinished nature of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program was partly the fault of Republican obstructionism and partly the result of delays that always occur when trying to overhaul such a large social program. The Affordable Care Act gave Mr. Obama\u2019s administration great latitude to reshape the nation\u2019s health care system, and the next president will inherit that same authority. \u201cThat latitude has worked for us,\u201d Mr. Daschle said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Trump presidency, it could work against us. \u201d Climate change, too, remains a work in progress. Internationally, Mr. Obama successfully pressed world leaders to aggressively confront the threats from a warming planet. At home, he demanded tougher fuel standards for cars and imposed new regulations on   power plants. But the international agreements Mr. Obama helped forge will play out over decades. It could be years before his environmental regulations are in place, if ever. It will be up to future presidents to navigate the politics of climate change, around the world and here at home. \u201cObama has set the stage for both effective domestic and global climate protection,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. \u201cBut most of the heaviest lifting is going to be done by his successor, especially regarding domestic politics. \u201d Ms. Psaki said the fact that large, developing countries like India and China are addressing climate change is \u201ca tremendous step forward\u201d that Mr. Obama can claim credit for. \u201cAround the world, a number of countries have cemented their goals. It\u2019s not a flash in the pan. \u201d And yet, Mr. Obama will have long since left office by the time the United States reaches its deadline to significantly reduce carbon emissions in 2025. And much of the rest of the world has pledged to reach its climate goals by 2030, in the fourth presidential term from now. Mr. Obama concluded his remarks in Grant Park by talking about a      woman, Ann Nixon Cooper, who had cast her ballot in Atlanta. He wondered aloud what changes his daughters would see in America if they lived to be the same age. It was, in a sense, a recognition that the consequences of his time in office would be shaped by others long after he left. \u201cWhat change will they see? What progress will we have made?\u201d Mr. Obama asked. \u201cThis is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time. \u201d For Barack Obama, that time is just about over.'"}, "time": 1742563098.7030997}
