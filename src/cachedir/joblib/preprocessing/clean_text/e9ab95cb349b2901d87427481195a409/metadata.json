And I\u2019m still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady.\u201d \\nAfter a scathing rebuke of the media\u2019s decision to ignore Trump\u2019s cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. \\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cI just feel gross all the time about this. Don\u2019t you all feel gross?\u201d he added, addressing the audience. \\nMcKinnon agrees and the two embark on a \u201cfriendship montage\u201d through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. \u201cNone of this would have mattered if you don\u2019t vote,\u201d Baldwin says. \\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,\u201d McKinnon finishes. \\nThey\u2019re right.'"}, "time": 1742562048.9948173}
