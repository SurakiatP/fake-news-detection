[As President Donald Trump wages war against federal bureaucrats left over from the Obama Administration, lawmakers are taking aim at this practice  \u2014   instituted by former Attorney General Eric Holder  \u2014   which effectively funds progressive     operations by shaking down financial institutions.  A 2015 Wall Street Journal   from Kimberly Strassel called the program \u201ca scheme to undermine Congress\u2019s spending authority by independently transferring dollars to President Obama\u2019s political allies. \u201d On Wednesday, Fox News named two Republicans who have submitted bills to eliminate this \u201cshadowy DOJ slush fund\u201d in both houses of Congress. Reporter Melissa Jacobs writes that \u201cinvestigators have accounted for $3 billion paid\u201d out through the practice: While legislation sputtered last year, lawmakers have resurrected an effort to quash the practice with companion bills in the House and Senate. \u201cDemocrats thought it was an attack on Obama,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford,  . speaking to Fox News. \u201cThis is not a Republican or Democrat issue, but one of good government. Actions settled by the federal government should go back to the federal government, back to the taxpayer. \u201d Lankford has introduced the Stop Settlement Slush Fund Act of 2017 while House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte,  . submitted similar legislation in the House. In late October, Breitbart News reported on the DOJ\u2019s \u201cextortion\u201d policy, though the story gained little national traction in the final weeks of the presidential election. A study by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) titled \u201cFollow the Money: How the Department of Justice Funds Progressive Activists,\u201d shed light on the Obama DOJ\u2019s de facto fundraiser for various progressive groups. GAI President and Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer appeared on the SiriusXM program Breitbart News Daily to discuss the new report. Schweizer summarized the policy as an effort \u201cto influence this election\u201d: What\u2019s really happening here is simple. You\u2019ve got large financial institutions on Wall Street, you\u2019ve got banks like Bank of America, who have in some cases committed financial crimes. I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, \u2018You committed these offenses, you\u2019ve got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.\u2019 Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that. Now, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you\u2019re supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers. The problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to   groups. They do it under the guise of, \u201cWell, you know, if this bank discriminated against lenders racially, we\u2019re going to give this money to these     housing groups to help deal with the problem. \u201d But that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on. These housing groups are advocacy groups. They\u2019re   organizations. They are registering voters and getting voters out to the voting booth. And they specifically target what they call   progressive voters. So this is taking the Department of Justice, which we\u2019ve experienced so much in recent years has been politicized by this Administration, even further to where now the Department of Justice is transferring money to   groups  \u2014   in an effort, frankly I think, to influence this election.
