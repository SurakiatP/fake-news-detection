[\u201cWhat [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions Justice Department needs to do now is track the hundreds of fellows who got these pardons and commutations,\u201d said former federal prosecutor Bill Otis. \u201cWith overall recidivism rates for drug offenses already being 77 percent, I think we have a pretty good idea, but [the public] should get specifics: How many of these guys   what\u2019s the nature of the new crime were there related violent crimes in the mix as well and how many victims (including but not limited to addicts and overdose victims) were there?\u201d  But only the Department of Justice has the manpower and access to raw data needed to detail and analyze Obama\u2019s     process which released a record 1, 715 convicts back into Americans\u2019 neighborhoods. At least one other group has tried to gauge the impact of President George W. Bush\u2019s pardons \u2014  but that group had to hire three researchers to assemble only some of the data that the federal government has at its fingertips but does not share. Since January, President Donald Trump has already taken some steps to increase federal transparency by forcing agencies to release data about crime by illegal aliens. For Otis, this change is a good example of what officials should do with information about Obama\u2019s commutations. \u201cIt may be helpful to have some kind of interagency standard or oversight body to ensure the public has reasonable access to the data it paid for,\u201d consistent with privacy rules, said Jason Richwine, a public policy expert who studies government data to gauge the impact of policy alternatives. \u201cWhen the government publishes [only] selected statistics from the restricted data, we get answers only to the questions that the government thinks are important \u2014  not necessarily the same questions that the public wants (or needs) to be answered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost always a good idea for the feds to be more transparent,\u201d said Otis. \u201cThe sheer size of the federal government makes it hard for citizens to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Otis wrote, adding: The feds should also be, not just more transparent, but quicker to release crime data. Because the present release procedures are so slow, liberals were able to deny for many months \u2014  if not close to a year \u2014  the crime spike that began at the end of 2014, and to dismiss it as just \u2018scattered reports\u2019 or \u2018a bunch of scaremonger anecdotes. In  January, as he was preparing to leave the White House, Obama claimed \u201cthere is no growing crime wave,\u201d despite the crime wave that has killed an extra 1, 500 Americans in 2015 and 2016. Sheltered by the embargo on government data that could have debunked his denial, Obama used his pardon power to shorten sentences for 1, 715 criminals, including traffickers of deadly drugs. Many of those who received clemency are also violent felons. For example, Obama commuted the sentence of a   drug trafficker sentenced for involvement in his   \u2019s shooting death \u2014  and Sherman Ray Meirovitz will be back on the streets in June instead of serving out a life sentence. Obama freed a former armed cocaine dealer onto Virginia\u2019s streets in March, along with a former armed Philadelphia crack cocaine dealer, plus a former armed California meth trafficker. Obama also justified his   release by claiming racial disparities in the criminal justice system. \u201cAbout one in every 35 African American men, one in every 88 Latino men is serving time right now. Among white men, that number is one in 214,\u201d Obama said in a 2015 NAACP speech. He continued: For nonviolent drug crimes, we need to lower long mandatory minimum sentences \u2014  or get rid of them entirely. Give judges some discretion around nonviolent crimes so that, potentially, we can steer a young person who has made a mistake in a better direction. We should pass a sentencing reform bill through Congress this year. We need to ask prosecutors to use their discretion to seek the best punishment, the one that\u2019s going to be most effective, instead of just the longest punishment. We should invest in alternatives to prison, like drug courts and treatment and probation programs. Obama\u2019s White House stated that 60 percent of those incarcerated in federal prison were black or Latino but declined to reveal critical details. The   claim deeply shaped Congress\u2019s debate over crime in 2015 and 2016, when Obama and his deputies tried to pass the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 (SCRA) which would have slashed mandatory minimums for drug traffickers. The bill\u2019s language, however, reached far beyond the small number of people convicted solely on drug offenses.  Sessions, who is now the U. S. Attorney General, noted in May 2016 that there are \u201cvirtually no cases of simple possession\u201d in the federal courts. Nearly all, or 99. 5 percent, of those incarcerated in federal prison for   \u201cnonviolent drug crimes\u201d are convicted on trafficking charges. The bill stalled in the Senate as a handful of Republican senators, including Arkansas\u2019 Tom Cotton and Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio, publicly opposed the legislation, and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump campaigned on a platform promising \u201claw and order. \u201d Defeated by data, Obama sought another path to reducing the federal prison population. \u201cAs was so often the case, Obama simply took the law into his own hands. Had Congress thought its prior drug laws were too stringent, it could have, by legislation, given retroactive effect to any lighter sentences it wanted,\u201d Otis explained. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t \u2014  the push for sentencing \u2018reform\u2019 fizzled. Frustrated with Congress\u2019s refusal to adopt even more of his   agenda, Obama just acted unilaterally. \u201d Now that Obama has provided clemency to 1, 715 prisoners, his actions will have   ramifications, Otis warned: I think there are two   effects of Obama\u2019s mass clemencies. One is to send the message that we\u2019re just not that serious anymore in dealing with drug traffickers, and that we think the real problem is that American is too callous and punitive (and racist?) \u2014  not that drug dealers are too unfeeling towards the lives they damage while trying to make a quick buck  \u2026     The other   effect will be simply to exacerbate the heroin overdose crisis that\u2019s been escalating for at least a decade. Why we become lenient toward drug dealers at exactly the moment the dangers of drugs have reached a shocking level is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Obama undertook his   campaign at a time when over 47, 000 Americans died from drug overdose deaths in 2014, including 28, 647 from opioid overdoses, and   overdose deaths tripled between 2010 and 2015. The CDC found over that a staggering 500, 000 people died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2014. It is difficult to track criminals who received commutations, especially when the government is reluctant to share or even collect important statistics, as several experts explained to Breitbart News. Without clear and detailed government data, activists and critics of government policies must rely on outside surveys, indirect or   data, often decorated by anecdotes. A Justice Department investigation into the makeup of the commutations would need to compare the makeup of the commuted population, versus the current prison population, versus the general population. Unfortunately, much of the needed data is not collected and the existing statistics sometimes raise more questions than they answer. For example, the Uniform Crime Reports, a compilation of street crime reports collected from 18, 000 different sources published annually by the FBI, has five race categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. \u201cWhite\u201d in the UCR\u2019s case includes all Latinos \u2014  and the Latino population in the U. S. stood at roughly 57 million in 2015. Blurring racial and ethnic categories makes obtaining a complete picture difficult. Since nearly all of the heroin used in the U. S. is brought across the border by Mexican traffickers, who are nearly always illegal aliens, there is an immigration angle to Obama\u2019s sentence commutations as well, made more opaque by the \u201cmuddled\u201d data collected by the feds. For example, a report by the CATO Institute recently claimed that Trump\u2019s new VOICE program was unwarranted because immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than similar Americans. \u201cOur headline finding is that both illegal immigrants and legal immigrants have incarceration rates far below those of   Americans \u2014  at 0. 85 percent, 0. 47 percent, and 1. 53 percent, respectively,\u201d claimed author Alex Nowrasteh. However, the study, titled \u201cCriminal Immigrants: Their Numbers, Demographics, and Countries of Origin,\u201d relies on extrapolations from the American Community Survey, not on actual data from the Department of Justice. That lack of DOJ data skews the CATO report because it cannot measure how many migrants were sent home before they could   like many American criminals who stay in the country to commit more crimes. That immigrant vs. American comparison problem might be reduced if the federal government released data showing the share of   criminals in jail under   offenses. But, said author Alex Nowrasteh, \u201cthat data is not in the    \u2026     If you have it, please share it. \u201d The group ProPublica tried to study the patterns in the pardons (not commutations) approved by President George W. Bush. The group recognized the lack of DOJ data and launched an enormous undertaking by at least two authors and three researchers, and extensive data analysis, to show that 494 requests for pardons were submitted, but only 189 were partly or fully approved. Of those 189 pardons, many were for   crimes, while only a small proportion was for drug offenses. \u201cAccounting for the effects of these variables did not eliminate the strong influence of race on getting a pardon [and] [a]fter testing all available variables, we found that whites were still nearly four times as likely to be pardoned as minorities overall,\u201d said the 2011 report, which explains the complexities caused by the lack of public federal data. President Bush relied almost exclusively on recommendations from the Office of the Pardon Attorney inside the Justice Department. The data thus provide an opportunity to assess the office\u2019s impact on final pardon decisions. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, ProPublica obtained the names of petitioners who were denied pardons during Bush\u2019s two terms \u2014  1, 729 individuals. The names of 189 petitioners who received pardons came from the pardon office website. ProPublica pulled a random sample of 500 names from the combined list  \u2026     For all those in the sample, ProPublica staff and freelance researchers searched public records or made phone contacts to gather demographic data such as age, race, gender and marital status. Researchers gathered sentencing information from federal court records and FOIA requests, and searched other records to collect data on bankruptcies, liens, financial judgments and any additional criminal history  \u2026     We conducted a binary logistic regression. The dependent variable was whether the petitioner received a pardon. We tested all other available variables against the outcome. In the end, variables that we included in the analysis were:   \u2026     Hispanic petitioners are classified as white in most federal court and prison records. To identify Hispanics in our sample, we relied on Hispanic surname or race as designated in other public records  \u2026     The government\u2019s habit of hoarding original data complicates many policy debates, said experts. When the government shares its data, the public can understand existing patterns and data, crime expert Heather McDonald told Breitbart News. For example, she said: [In] New York City blacks make up 53 percent of all New York police department pedestrian stops, but blacks are only 23 percent of the city\u2019s population. To a na\u00efve observer, that disparity in police activity looks like racism. What you need to know is that blacks commit 75 percent of all shootings in New York City and 70 percent of all robberies. By contrast, whites are 34 percent of the population but they commit less than two percent of all shootings and less than four percent of all robberies. Whites make up nine percent of all police pedestrian stops. So blacks are actually under stopped compared to what their crime rates would predict and whites are over stopped compared to what their crime rates would predict. The extra knowledge can help resolve public debates, such as the controversy over race and arrests rates, she explained. \u201cThe big fallacy of all   activism is to ignore the fact that policing today is   and police go where people are most being victimized and that is in minority neighborhoods. But the public is, by and large, clueless about how vast the disparities in criminal offending are,\u201d she said. \u201cThe federal government could take the lead in educating the public about policing and crime. \u201d On immigration issues, the federal government hides data about the scale of   programs, such as the   program, and it hides data about green card holders, said Steven Camarota, research director at the   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Similarly, the federal government has muddled data regarding repatriations, he said, adding: \u201cThis is how the Obama administration made [the number of] deportations look higher. \u201d The federal government does have data from the states about the number of illegal aliens in U. S. jails, but it only releases data about the annual number of hours spent by all illegal alien prisoners, he continued. The data about cumulative hours is released via federal reports about federal funding for state jails that house illegal aliens. \u201cIt is not enough to know that Arizona says they had a million hours of aliens in prison in the last year,\u201d he told Breitbart News. \u201cYou want to know what that is a percentage of the total\u201d number of hours and prisoners, he said. Without the   \u201cmicrocode\u2019 data, he said, \u201cwe can\u2019t do our own analysis. \u201d \u201cI would like to know all the different categories of people among those arrested,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the CIS. \u201cHow many have protected status? How many have green cards?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey won\u2019t even tell us how many are \u201d she said, adding: \u201cI know they can do a breakdown because I\u2019ve seen it in the past. \u201d The Department of Homeland Security should reveal far more of the data is keeps secret, said Vaughan, including: \u201cThe number of releases of illegal aliens from ICE custody, the number of people who are caught and released by the Border Patrol, how about the number of people who are here on exchange visas who are working as opposed to studying? The number on [Optional Practical Training] approvals  \u2026     [and] what \u2018training\u2019 they\u2019re doing and the number of terror convicts who are foreign born. \u201d For example, the agency should release data about \u2018IRS tax returns which are filed by people who provide two different [identification] numbers  \u2026     how many times are returns filed with a number that is used multiple times  \u2026     how many employers are reporting information that includes Social Security Numbers that are used by multiple employees,\u201d she said. The Department of Education should collect and release data about how private universities treat applications by people from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that private universities are willing to divulge,\u201d he told Breitbart News. Until the federal government chooses to accurately collect and then publicize such crime data, Americans seeking the truth about dangerous criminals released into their communities will continue to be left in the dark. \u201cData about Obama\u2019s commutations would be especially useful, for a reason that\u2019s easy to see: They were given out in record numbers, vastly more than any President at least since Eisenhower,\u201d Otis told Breitbart News. \u201cWhy was that? Maybe we should examine the facts to find out. It could be that there were so many more harmless or   people in federal prison when Obama was President, but, if so, let\u2019s put the facts on the table. \u201d \u201cIn deciding the real basis for Obama\u2019s nearly unprecedented clemency binge, of course it would be useful for the public (and the press, if it had any interest) to be able to see more of the story behind the clemency decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cOne other thing: Liberals are forever telling us that we need \u2018 \u2019 policy, only they seldom seem to welcome the data,\u201d he added.
