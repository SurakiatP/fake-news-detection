Scroll Down For Video Below \\nBut an official familiar with the matter said Friday that the new materials, perhaps thousands of emails, were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. Comey was briefed on the findings in recent days, resulting in the director\u2019s notification to Congress, said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. \\nThe emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by Weiner, who is separated from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Abedin also had access to the same device or devices. The official said it was not likely that the FBI\u2019s review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day. \\nIn a brief news conference in Iowa on Friday evening, Clinton said, \u201cThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\u201d a position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The Democratic nominee called on the FBI \u201cto release all the information that it has.\u201d \\n\u201cAs you know I\u2019ve had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,\u201d Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Thursday night. During a speech in New Hampshire earlier in the day, the Republican presidential nominee gleefully discussed the \u201cbreaking news announcement.\u201d \\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d Trump said, and her \u201ccriminal scheme\u201d should not be allowed in the Oval Office. \u201cPerhaps justice will be done,\u201d the GOP nominee said of the development. In his statement, Podesta demanded that the FBI director \u201cprovide the American public more information than is contained in the letter\u201d to lawmakers. \\n\u201cUpon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cIn the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. \\n\u201cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,\u201d Podesta added. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said nothing had \u201csurfaced to change the president\u2019s opinion and views of Secretary Clinton.\u201d \\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day,\u201d Schultz said. In July, Comey announced that while Clinton and her aides during her tenure as secretary of State had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in the way they\u2019d handled classified information, he recommended that no criminal charges be filed. \\nIn her press conference Friday, Clinton said she was \u201cconfident\u201d whatever is included in the new messages under review \u201cwill not change the conclusion reached in July.\u201d In July, Comey testified before skeptical Republican lawmakers to explain the bureau\u2019s recommendation, which had been adopted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re mystified and confused by the fact pattern you laid out and the conclusion you reached,\u201d House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Comey. Comey, however, was unequivocal in maintaining that the conclusion of investigators was not a close call. \\n\u201cThere is no way anybody would bring a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts,\u201d he told the House panel on July 7. Trump has cited the closed FBI probe as evidence that the election was \u201crigged\u201d against him, and at a recent debate the GOP nominee said that, if he\u2019s elected president, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. \\nFollowing Comey\u2019s announcement Friday, Republicans blasted the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cHillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. \\n\u201cThis decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,\u201d Ryan said in a statement, adding that he was again calling for Clinton to no longer receive classified briefings, a traditional courtesy afforded major-party presidential nominees. \\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the timing of the decision, so soon before the election, demonstrated \u201chow serious this discovery must be.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, wrote on Twitter that \u201ca great day in our campaign just got even better.\u201d A great day in our campaign just got even better.

Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that \u201cwithout knowing how many emails are involved, who wrote them, when they were written or their subject matter, it\u2019s impossible to make any informed judgment on this development.\u201d \\nShe added: \u201d The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today\u2019s break from that tradition is appalling.\u201d \\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of attempting to \u201cmisrepresent\u201d the FBI\u2019s work. \u201cSadly but predictably, Republicans are doing their best to \u2026 warp the FBI\u2019s work to serve their partisan conspiracy-mongering against Hillary Clinton,\u201d Pelosi said. \\nThe uncertainty of what the new FBI review will yield, and when it will be completed, leaves open the question of how much of an impact it will have on the presidential campaign, as Trump looks to mount what would be a historic comeback, as polls show him trailing nationally and in key battleground states. \\n\u201cUnless the FBI closes this new investigation one way or the other next week, the likely impact will be to cut into Clinton\u2019s margin, with the bigger effect being on down-ballot races than on the outcome of the presidential election,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in an emailed statement. \\nWhatever the long-term impact, the short-term jolt to Trump and his supporters, at least, seemed clear. \\nIn his New Hampshire speech, the GOP nominee suggested the rest of his message for the day would no longer matter as much, given the FBI announcement. \u201cThe rest of my speech is going to be so boring,\u201d he joked.'"}, "time": 1742564244.318853}
