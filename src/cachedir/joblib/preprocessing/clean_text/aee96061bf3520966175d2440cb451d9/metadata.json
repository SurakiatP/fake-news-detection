Early voting has already been going on in a number of the most important battleground states, and up to this point the numbers seem to support the theory   doing significantly better in key swing states than Mitt Romney did in 2012. As you will see below, the latest numbers released by Florida, North Carolina, Colorado and Arizona all have good news for the Trump campaign. Without a doubt, I still have an   happen tomorrow night, but so far at least there are some encouraging signs. \\nFlorida \\nEarly voting has become extremely popular in Florida, and at this point close to half of all voters in the state have already cast their ballots . \\nDonald Trump cannot win the election without Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes, and so to say that this is a \u201cmust win\u201d for the Trump campaign would be a massive understatement. \\nFortunately, the Trump campaign appears to be doing much better in Florida than the Romney campaign did in 2012. The following comes from Politico \u2026 \\nFlorida Democrats increased their lead over Republicans in casting pre-Election Day ballots to nearly 33,000 as of Sunday morning, but the sheer number of new voters and independents makes it tougher than ever for experts to say whether Hillary Clinton has a clear advantage over Donald Trump in the nation\u2019s biggest battleground state. \\nOf the record 6.1 million in-person early votes and absentee ballots cast, Democrats have an advantage over Republicans of only 0.5 percentage points, with each party casting roughly 39 percent of the ballots. Though it\u2019s a lead for Democrats, they\u2019re not going to match their 3.7-percentage-point lead in early votes by Election Day they enjoyed in 2012. And Republicans tend to outvote Democrats on Election Day in Florida. \\nOn Monday, updated numbers for Florida were released, and we found out that the Democrats had increased their lead to about 87,000 votes. But Trump is still doing much better than Romney was at this stage. \\nAnd the Trump campaign also has to be happy about the fact that first-time voters account for 25 percent of all the votes cast so far. Throughout this election cycle Trump has shown that he can bring out people that have never voted before, and so officials in the Trump campaign have to be smiling about this. \\nHowever, one sign of trouble for the Trump campaign is the fact that there has been a 100 percent increase in early voting by Hispanics in Florida compared to 2012, and this appears to be fueled by dislike for Trump. The following comes from the Miami Herald \u2026 \\nThrough Saturday, 565,000 Hispanics had completed early in-person voting in Florida, a 100 percent increase over 2012, according to an analysis by Dan Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who tracks voting data. \\nIncluding absentee ballots, 911,000 Hispanics have voted \u2014 more than a third of whom did not vote in 2012. \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing explosive early voting turnout of Hispanics \u2014 both those newly registered to vote as well as those who sat on the sidelines in 2012,\u201d Smith said. \\nAs discussed above, Republicans tend to outvote Democrats on Election Day in Florida, so the key for the Trump campaign will be to have the same kind of Election Day turnout that the Romney campaign had in 2012. \\nIf Trump wins Florida, he will have a legitimate shot at winning the election, but if he loses the state it will be virtually impossible for him to make up those 29 electoral votes elsewhere on the map. \\nNorth Carolina \\nAnother state that the Trump campaign desperately needs is North Carolina. Mitt Romney won this state back in 2012, and according to the Drudge Report the Trump campaign is doing even better than the Romney campaign did during early voting\u2026 \\nAnother dramatic turn of events is being reported out of North Carolina this afternoon: Donald Trump has jumped past all expectations in early voting! \\nIn 2012, Romney hit Election Day down 447,000 votes, based on early ballots. He went on to win the state by 97,000 votes. \\nNow, the DRUDGE REPORT can reveal, Trump opens Election Day down 305,000! \\nNorth Carolina is another of the key battleground states that is going to help decide the election. While not as important as Florida, the truth is that Donald Trump pretty much has to have it to have a legitimate shot. \\nColorado \\nAll along, most of the pundits have pretty much assumed that Hillary Clinton was going to win Colorado. \\nUnfortunately for her, the Denver Post is reporting that the number of Republicans that have voted so far exceeds the number of Democrats that have voted\u2026 \\nRepublicans took the lead in early voting in Colorado   Friday and held the advantage through the weekend despite robust Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts. \\nThe latest early voting numbers released Monday morning show registered Republicans cast 652,380 ballots compared to 645,020 registered Democrats \u2014 a 7,360 vote GOP advantage. The breakdown looks like this: 35.2 percent Republican, 34.8 percent Democrat and 28.5 percent unaffiliated. \\nIf Donald Trump could find a way to actually win Colorado, that would definitely lessen the pressure of having to win Nevada where he is not doing nearly as well so far. \\nArizona \\nThe state of Arizona used to be considered \u201cdeep red\u201d territory, but during this election cycle it has been considered a battleground state. \\nFortunately for Trump the poll numbers in Arizona have shifted in his direction in recent days, and the early numbers coming out of the state look very good for him \u2026 \\nThe Republican lead in absentee ballots returned is 95,000. Bill Dunn, the party\u2019s director of early and absentee voting, said Republicans lead with 36.5 percent of absentee ballots requested but have an even greater advantage in absentee ballots returned, at 40 percent of the total. \\nIn the waning days of the campaign Donald Trump has been criss-crossing the country, and he continues to draw absolutely enormous crowds. Conservative voters are far more enthusiastic about Trump than they were about Romney, but will it be enough?

In fact, one of them told CNN that he believes   going to win by \u201can electoral landslide\u201d\u2026 \\nHillary Clinton will win in an electoral landslide on Tuesday, but the political baggage she has accumulated over the past year-and-a-half will dissuade congressional Republicans from working with her administration, says longtime Republican political strategist John Weaver. \\n\u201cI believe she\u2019s going to win in an electoral landslide and be the most unpopular president in electoral history, which is quite the paradox,\u201d Weaver told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. \\nAnd ultimately it could be the establishment Republicans and the \u201cnever-Trumpers\u201d that make the difference and deliver the election to Hillary Clinton. If you can believe it, some establishment Republicans are actually publicly announcing that they have voted for Hillary Clinton and are encouraging others to do the same. \\nIf they can get just five percent of Republicans to follow them, they could completely alter the outcome of the election. So let us hope that does not happen. \\nOn a positive note, on Monday we learned that Hillary Clinton has canceled her celebratory fireworks for Tuesday night. No reason was given for why the fireworks were canceled, but many are taking this as a sign that the Clinton campaign may not be as optimistic as they were previously. \\nIn any event, we don\u2019t have long to wait now until we find out who wins and who loses. \\nIf you want Donald Trump to win, please go vote, because America may never be faced with this kind of a choice again. \\nI am absolutely convinced that this is a pivotal moment in American history, and on Tuesday night we find out what happens. \\nMay God have mercy on the late, great United States of America.
