And again, I can\u2019t even ballpark \u2018near future\u2019 right now but it\u2019s imminent,\u201d said a senior Pentagon official, speaking to Reuters and other media anonymously in Paris. \\nRussia has not been invited to join the effort. The US-led coalition has condemned Moscow\u2019s involvement in Syria, which was officially invited by the government of President Bashar Assad. \\n\u201cRussia is not a participant in our Raqqa plan,\u201d said Carter, who insisted that despite the breakdown of a proposed US and Russia-mediated ceasefire and accusations over Aleppo the two sides have a shared interest in defeating IS. \\n\u201cWe do deconflict our coalition operations with Russia through a very professional military-to-military channel. That channel is active every day, and everyone behaves themselves very professionally on both sides in that channel,\u201d Carter added. \\nThe Kurds, another major faction that has played a key role in combatting Islamist threats in Syria, are expected to stay away from Raqqa, in part because it lies outside the area they view as their unrecognized homeland. \\n\u201cTruthfully, the Kurds that I\u2019ve dealt with don\u2019t intend \u2013 they\u2019re not comfortable going into Raqqa. They know they can play a role in shaping and isolating Raqqa but it\u2019s not their intent to be involved in the actual seizure of the city,\u201d said the Pentagon source cited by Reuters. \\nThe Syrian administration has so far not reacted to the plan, though has previously condemned the international force \u2013 which has supported the uprising against President Assad since 2011 \u2013 for violating the country\u2019s sovereignty. \\nThe US-led coalition has executed air strikes on Raqqa since 2014, despite having no UN mandate to operate inside Syria. It has not been in position to carry out a full-scale ground assault. \\nDespite saying he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the progress of the campaign against ISIS, both Carter and Hollande warned separately that the group may further evolve its tactics and redirect its efforts towards guerilla insurgency or suicide attacks in Europe.'"}, "time": 1742563185.9201424}
