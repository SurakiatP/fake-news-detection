Today\u2019s introduction comes to us from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief. Asif Mahmood was born in a small village in rural Pakistan. He came to the United States 26 years ago to study medicine, and is today a pulmonologist in Pasadena. At age 56, he has decided to run for lieutenant governor of California. \u201cThe divisive and hateful agenda of Donald Trump compels me to run,\u201d Dr. Mahmood said Tuesday in an interview. \u201cI am a proud Muslim. I am a Muslim immigrant. I am from the state of California. I am a triple threat to Donald Trump. \u201d Dr. Mahmood will officially announce his first bid for public office Wednesday morning. The election is in November 2018. If elected, he would perhaps be the first Muslim to hold statewide office in California. That said, there are already a number of Muslims in public office across the country, including two Muslims in Congress, according to Mohammed Nadeem, the executive director of the Muslim Observer, which tracks these kinds of elections. (And in Michigan, a Muslim man is running for governor.) Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the incumbent, is barred by term limits from seeking a third term he is running for governor. This is not one of the   jobs in the state, but, it can be a steppingstone for anyone hoping to run for governor. (Case in point: Mr. Newsom.) So far, only one other person, a state senator, has signaled that he\u2019s running. Still, as a newcomer to politics, Dr. Mahmood certainly has an uphill climb here. He has retained Ace Smith, one of the state\u2019s top Democratic political consultants, to run his race. Mr. Smith said Dr. Mahmood would probably need between $1 million to $3 million to mount a campaign, and seemed confident he could raise it. Dr. Mahmood said his experience as a doctor gave him credentials to campaign on health care reform. He did not dispute that he was a bit of a  . But Dr. Mahmood said he did not think his religion would be an obstacle in California, of all states. \u201cThere might be a small segment of people who feel that way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am a proud Muslim and a proud immigrant and I love America. I deal with Americans every day. And when you help them they are totally appreciative of that. \u201d (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 Representative Devin Nunes of California said he would continue to lead a House investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, despite accusations from Democrats that he is too close to President Trump to conduct an impartial inquiry.

The first two shows will be held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on July 15 and 16. [The New York Times] The vote to approve the Oakland Raiders\u2019 move to Las Vegas, though expected by many, prompted outrage in the Bay Area and beyond. \u201cSee you, Mark Davis,\u201d Ann Killion wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cDon\u2019t let the door to our legendary, beautiful, thriving market hit you in the butt on the way out. \u201d For others, the move was a reminder of the first time the Raiders left Oakland. The team departed the Bay Area in 1982, decamping to Southern California. Los Angeles granted the team a larger cultural footprint, seen in the Raiders hats and jackets often worn by the rap group N. W. A. But the Raiders returned north 13 years later thanks to the promise of an expanded stadium. And many citizens of Raider Nation are hoping  \u2014   and even outright expecting  \u2014   that the team will once again return, maybe even within a decade or two.
