Trump, according to the party and a cybersecurity firm. One group placed espionage software on the committee\u2019s computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion. A senior government official said Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, based in Brooklyn, also appeared to have been targeted, but it was not clear whether it lost any data. The breach at the Democratic committee was first reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post. The committee\u2019s systems appeared to have had standard cyberprotections, which are no challenge for determined   hacking groups. The attackers were expelled last weekend with CrowdStrike\u2019s help, the committee said. It did not provide a detailed account of what had been copied from the systems, and it may never know. The connection to Russia may be explained simply by the global fascination with the presidential campaign and the mystery surrounding Mr. Trump, who has not been a major subject of foreign intelligence collection. But it also recalls a subplot to the race: Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, previously advised   politicians in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, including former President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine. Opposition research itself is not all that valuable to a foreign government, but it can point to a candidate\u2019s vulnerabilities. To a foreign government fascinated by an American election, any intelligence a campaign develops on an opponent could be exploited. Dmitri Alperovitch, a   of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committee\u2019s servers  \u2014   a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach  \u2014   appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House. In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions. \u201cThese are incredibly sophisticated groups,\u201d Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThey covered their tracks well. It wasn\u2019t until the second group came in,\u201d stealing the opposition research on Mr. Trump, \u201cthat their presence was detected. \u201d The second group, named Fancy Bear, which appeared to have attacked in April, is believed to be operated by the G. R. U. the military intelligence service. Its past targets have included military and aerospace organizations from the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and South Korea. CrowdStrike concluded that neither Russian group knew the other was attacking the same organization. \u201cOne would steal a password, and the next day the other group would steal the same password,\u201d Mr. Alperovitch said. Mrs. Clinton said on Telemundo that she had learned of the breach only after news outlets reported it. She called it \u201ctroubling,\u201d but said she was unsure about the hackers\u2019 goals. \u201cNow, why?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. So far as we know, my campaign has not been hacked into, and we\u2019re obviously looking hard at that. But cybersecurity will be an issue that I will be absolutely focused on as president. Because whether it\u2019s Russia, or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information, to use it to their advantage, and we can\u2019t let that go on. \u201d The Office of Personnel Management, whose files on about 22 million Americans with security clearances or applications for them were breached by Chinese hackers, is still trying to assess the damage first detected last year. The Democratic committee avoided any discussion of its vulnerabilities. \u201cThe security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with,\u201d said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic national chairwoman. \u201cWhen we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately. Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network. \u201d The party did not say how it came to suspect the intrusion. Cyberattacks by foreign governments are a constant threat to political campaigns. Because campaign operations are temporary, they often do not invest heavily in the kind of security that financial institutions, large companies and government agencies spend millions or billions of dollars on each year. And because campaigns are so   with volunteers connecting through laptops and cellphones, they are particularly vulnerable. In 2008, hackers traced to the Chinese government infiltrated the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain. \u201cIt should come as no surprise to anyone that political parties are   targets for foreign intelligence gathering,\u201d Representative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who has been deeply involved in cyberissues, said in a statement. \u201cNonetheless, it is disconcerting that two independent operations were able to penetrate the D. N. C. one of which was able to stay embedded for nearly a year. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562904.435077}
