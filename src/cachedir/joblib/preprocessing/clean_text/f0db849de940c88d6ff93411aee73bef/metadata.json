Is there any clash of ideas as \u201cmonumental\u201d as the one over our city\u2019s skyline? For every spike, steeple and spire, there are wastebaskets full of dashed architectural ambitions. These unbuilt projects often tell us as much about our city\u2019s history and values as the built environment, says Sam Lubell,   with Greg Goldin of \u201cNever Built New York. \u201d Take I. M. Pei\u2019s Hyperboloid, a sleek hourglass office tower and transit hub proposed in the 1950s, which would have entailed the demolition of Grand Central Terminal. Even as the rest of America took to the road in cars, and struggling railroads were liquidating assets, our city preserved the   building in Midtown. (Sorry about that, Mr. Pei, but we\u2019re glad it didn\u2019t pan out.) Or imagine floating in a translucent bubble to Governors Island on a gondola designed by Santiago Calatrava. Sounds nice, but in 2006 The Times\u2019s architecture critic argued that the plan ran up against one of New York\u2019s hottest commodities: a spectacular view. And then there was Trump City. Donald J. Trump\u2019s plan for a grandiose, 14.        on the West Side would have included office buildings, 7, 600 apartments, a huge shopping mall and the world\u2019s tallest building. But its magnitude aroused staunch opposition in the neighborhood, sparking what Mr. Trump described as \u201ca war to the death. \u201d Trump City was eventually downgraded to what is now known as Trump Place  \u2014   where, earlier this week, the owner of three buildings removed the  \u2019s name from their fa\u00e7ades. Occasionally, though, adventurous architecture does get built here. Test your knowledge of New York\u2019s new skyline with this quiz: Can you identify some of our most iconic modern structures by their silhouettes? Here\u2019s what else is happening: Mirror, mirror, on the wall, which day is the fairest of them all? Today. Sunshine. Blue skies.  . Enough said. We\u2019ll have another divine day on Saturday, but beginning that night  \u2014   and lasting the rest of the weekend  \u2014   things are looking   and wet. \u2022 How Rudolph W.
