Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. \\nMaking matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. \\n{snip} \\nDespite their aversion to covering stories that put Trump in a sympathetic light, members of the media had no choice but to cover the extremely newsworthy Oct. 15 weekend firebombing of Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory called the arson \u201can attack on our democracy,\u201d while one GOP official called it an act of \u201cpolitical terrorism.\u201d Spray-painted on the building next door were a swastika and the sentence \u201cNazi Republicans get out of town or else.\u201d \\nMeanwhile, most physical attacks on Trump supporters make only local news outlet\u2013if that. Rarely do such assaults get mentioned on the evening TV broadcast news or in The New York Times or The Washington Post. That\u2019s because they don\u2019t fit the leftist narrative that Republicans are violent, racist, Islamophobic homophobes. \\n{snip} \\nHere is a compilation of some of the attacks on Trump supporters: \\nOn Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?\u201d \\nAround Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. \u201cThe two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by \u2018some thugs\u2019 that a barmaid called out from the back.\u201d Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d shirt. \\nOn Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. \\nOn Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. {snip} \\nOn Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. \\n{snip} \\nOn Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. \u201cThe motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,\u201d a police spokesman said. \u201cThe [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him.\u201d The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, \\n{snip} \\nThis is not an exhaustive list of violent attacks on Trump supporters. \\nNo doubt there will be plenty more such assaults in the final two weeks, as Americans head to the polls. \\nAnd Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign may be involved in those attacks.'"}, "time": 1742563083.4125814}
