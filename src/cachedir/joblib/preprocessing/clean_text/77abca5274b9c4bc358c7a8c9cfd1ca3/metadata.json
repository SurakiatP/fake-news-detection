Leaving the EU is going to have some really horrible consequences for our country, and I think I supported it because I had a lot of unresolved feelings about Top Gear . \\n\u201cLooking back, I think I actually just wanted to hear Clarkson talk about political correctness, steak and Argies, and the Brexit rhetoric was a surrogate for that. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing actually\u201d he added. \u201cMy mates in the Whatsapp group are feeling the same. Is there anyway we can take it back?\u201d \\nProfessor Scott Chegg from the University of Bristol said this conforms to the \u2018safety-valve\u2019 theory of politics. \\n\u201cIn the same way a lefty might read The Guardian or watch a documentary about cetaceans with anxiety issues to feel better about themselves without changing anything, it seems Top Gear was a way for people to let their right-wing grievances out in manageable chunks,\u201d he told us. \\n\u201cWithout Top Gear , the pressure built to a dangerous level before exploding as Brexit. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a man who feels very angsty for an unknown reason, starts drinking, gets into a fight, sets his house on fire and steals a car before driving it off a cliff,\u201d Professor Chegg explained. \\n\u201cIf he\u2019d just had a wank and gone to sleep everything would have been fine.\u201d \\nReports from social media suggest a similar wave of stomach crushing realisation is happening in America as The Grand Tour gains traction there. \\nAt the time of writing, Mr Williams was ordering Article 50 For Dummies on Amazon Prime. \\n\u201cI spent \u00a370 on it,\u201d he said. \u201cBest use it for something else.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742564266.1599028}
