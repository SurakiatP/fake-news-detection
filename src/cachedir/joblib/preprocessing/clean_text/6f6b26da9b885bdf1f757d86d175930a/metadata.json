Ted Cruz ( ) reminded the Democrats, who one after another criticized the nominee, that during his confirmation hearing a decade ago for the federal seat he holds now, not one Democrat  \u2014   including Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama  \u2014   voted against Gorsuch. [\u201cA decade ago, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed by this committee for the Federal Court of Appeals by a voice vote,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe was likewise confirmed by the entire United States Senate by a voice vote without a single Democrat speaking a word of opposition.  \u201cNot a word of opposition from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNot from Harry Reid, or Ted Kennedy, or John Kerry. \u201d \u201cNot from Senators Feinstein, Leahey, or Durbin, who still sit on this committee,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNot even from Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Joe Biden. \u201d \u201cNot a one of them spoke a word against Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination a decade ago,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz said that not only did President Donald Trump play an unprecedented role in the selection of a justice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia by telling the American people of the 21 people  \u2014   including Gorsuch  \u2014   who would be under consideration if he were elected president, but the voters weighed in. Thus, Gorsuch was \u201cno ordinary nominee,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHis nomination carries with it a super legitimacy that is also unprecedented in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe American people played a very direct role in helping choose this nominee. \u201d Cruz also noted that since Democrats voted for Gorsuch\u2019s federal judgeship 10 years ago, his outstanding record since then should make confirming him even easier. Notwithstanding its leftist political leanings, the American Bar Association (ABA) earlier this month gave Gorsuch a \u201cwell qualified\u201d rating to serve as a justice on the U. S. Supreme Court. The ABA has three ratings for judicial nominees: not qualified, qualified, and well qualified. The ABA\u2019s standing committee on the federal judiciary was unanimous in granting Gorsuch its highest rating.'"}, "time": 1742563129.9787405}
