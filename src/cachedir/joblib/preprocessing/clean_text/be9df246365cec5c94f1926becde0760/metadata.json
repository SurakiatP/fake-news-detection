Indeed, the magazine found a source that said the job is Starr\u2019s \u201cif he wants it. \u201d Starr lost his job at Baylor last year amid an investigation into sexual abuse charges against several of the school\u2019s football players. As the sex charges grew, Starr eventually resigned his position leading the college. According to a school newspaper report on Starr\u2019s resignation, Baylor removed Starr because he refused to act on several reported rapes going back as far as 2009, a year before he even assumed office. Of course, Ken Starr most famously headed up the independent investigation into President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Starr investigated the death of Clinton operative Vince Foster, looked into the Clintons\u2019 shady investment dealings, and led the inquiry into Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual harassment of White House aide Monica Lewinsky. Starr\u2019s investigations eventually led to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment in the House of Representatives. The Senate did not convict Clinton, and he was able to complete his presidency.
