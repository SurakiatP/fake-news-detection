His personal and professional relationships \u2014 all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton \u2014 reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe. \\nThese concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comey\u2019s former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partner\u2019s board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation\u2019s taxes. \\nLockheed Martin \\nWhen President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers. \\nBut Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year. \\nComey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel . \\nHow much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation . \\nLockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor . The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010. \\nAccording to records , Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010 . \\nIn 2010 , Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department. \\nHSBC Holdings \\nIn 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings. \\n\u201cMr. Comey\u2019s appointment will be for an initial three-year term which, subject to re-election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting,\u201d according to HSBC company records . \\nHSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation . For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to \u201cretrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sector\u201d in \u201cNew York City.\u201d \\n\u201cRetrofitting\u201d refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected \u201c $1 billion in financing \u201d for this Green initiative to conserve people\u2019s energy in low-income housing units.'"}, "time": 1742563037.112139}
