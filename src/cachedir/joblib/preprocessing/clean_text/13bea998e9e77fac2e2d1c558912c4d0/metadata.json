His linen suit was appropriately rumpled  \u2014   everything about this public radio legend suggests disregard for crisp lines  \u2014   and his gangly legs were jacked up against the glove box, as he resisted suggestions to slide his seat back. Hitching a ride with a reporter from Minneapolis to his home here, he filled the yawning silences with a weird little singsong, \u201cbomp, bomp, bomp, bomp. \u201d He had just spent hours rehearsing for the following night, May 21, when he hosted \u201cA Prairie Home Companion,\u201d at the State Theater in Minneapolis, before a packed, adoring crowd for the last time. After more than four decades of hosting this homespun Americana musical variety program, which he created and which, in turn, created him, Mr. Keillor is retiring. He has done this before, in 1987, though that retirement ended up being a sabbatical. In 2011, there were rumors  \u2014   baseless, Mr. Keillor\u2019s people said  \u2014   that he was thinking of abandoning ship then, too. But this time, Mr. Keillor, 73, said he means it. He has named a successor and lined up meaty  \u201cPrairie\u201d projects, among them columns for The Washington Post, a screenplay and a book. While he has a solo tour planned through the year, along with a \u201cPrairie\u201d  Labor Day weekend show at the Minnesota State Fair, he will host his final official \u201cPrairie Home Companion\u201d on July 1 at, of all places, the Hollywood Bowl. \u201cIt\u2019s very much real, and it\u2019s simply a matter of wanting to rearrange one\u2019s life,\u201d Mr. Keillor said after we had arrived at his large, handsome Georgian house, and he had eased his stooping    frame into a porch chair. \u201cIn order to do these things, I\u2019ve got to clear out the big buffalo in the room, which is the show. \u201d At his home, Mr. Keillor looms, a melancholy presence, and doesn\u2019t make much eye contact, keeping his bespectacled eyes averted under scraggly eyebrows. Rather than savor the conversation, he seems to cordially endure it. His mellifluous voice, likened to a down comforter or \u201ca slow drip of Midwestern molasses,\u201d feels warmly familiar to any public radio listener who has heard him sing \u201cTishomingo Blues,\u201d which opens his show each Saturday evening. Yet as familiar and cherished as \u201cPrairie\u201d has become to millions, it was always about Mr. Keillor\u2019s fascinations, rather than the inner tickings of its host. \u201cIt was never about self expression, never,\u201d Mr. Keillor said. Everything about \u201cPrairie Home\u201d  \u2014   the Guy Noir and Lives of the Cowboys sketches, the spots for Powdermilk Biscuits and the Ketchup Advisory Board, the monologues about the fictional Lake Wobegon  \u2014   sprang from Mr. Keillor\u2019s imagination. But the man spinning the plates at the center of it all managed to stay a mystery, even to people who know him well. \u201cGarrison in person is quite different,\u201d said his longtime friend, the writer Mark Singer. \u201cGarrison does not express emotion in interpersonal conversations the way the rest of us do. \u201d Performers often cultivate alternate personas, but with Mr. Keillor the difference is startling. That night, onstage in Minneapolis, he was garrulous and affable, and afterward ventured out onto the sidewalk to meet his   admirers, many of whom feel they know him intimately. As fans flocked around him, Mr. Keillor graciously deflected questions, directing queries back to the scrum. This helps him gather story ideas but also serves as a bridge from his onstage personality to his default setting, the introverted, removed man who seems miles away, even when you\u2019re sitting two feet from him on his porch, eating the jelly beans he has set out. \u201cHis gaze is often floating and takes you in from a strange distance,\u201d said the writer and editor Roger Angell, who in 1970 edited Mr. Keillor\u2019s first piece for The New Yorker. \u201cHe is certainly the strangest person I know. \u201d There is debate about whether Mr. Keillor should have exited a while ago. His weekly radio audience peaked 10 years ago, at 4. 1 million, and has since dropped to 3. 2 million. While that does not include listeners on Sirius XM, or the show\u2019s three million monthly digital requests, many stations have dropped their Sunday repeat broadcast of his show. \u201cPrairie Home\u201d captured a time, before tweets and Facebook posts, when people talked more over fence posts and pots of coffee but nowadays feels increasingly removed from many listeners\u2019 lives. \u201cA lot of the conversation has been: \u2018Did Garrison wait too long? Should Garrison have done this years ago? \u2019\u201d said Eric Nuzum, former vice president for programming at NPR. \u201cThe problem of \u2018Prairie Home Companion\u2019 is it\u2019s part of public radio\u2019s past, not their future,\u201d Mr. Nuzum said. (American Public Media distributes \u201cPrairie Home\u201d NPR member stations air programs from APM as well as from other distributors.) Still, Mr. Keillor played an outsize role in shaping what public radio has become. He was a pioneering force and taught public radio valuable lessons, Mr. Nuzum said. The live performances and touring built audiences and kept them connected and deeply loyal. That proved lucrative, as did sales of \u201cPrairie Home Companion\u201d recordings, books, clothes and tchotchkes. Mr. Keillor also became one of public radio\u2019s earliest celebrities, appearing on the cover of Time in 1985. The show itself, with its singing, quirky sidekicks, stealthily dark humor and fart jokes, forged a new path. \u201c\u2018Prairie Home Companion\u2019 came on the scene just as public radio was trying to figure out what its identity was,\u201d said Ira Glass, the host of \u201cThis American Life. \u201d \u201cThe fact that here was such a visibly weird, funny, idiosyncratic show opened up the space of other weird, idiosyncratic shows, like \u2018Car Talk,\u2019 and our show. \u201d Adored as he has been by millions, Mr. Keillor drove a few critics around the bend. Detractors view \u201cPrairie Home\u201d as excruciatingly hokey, syrupy and dull. In a 1993 episode of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d Homer bangs on the television  \u2014   the Disney Channel broadcast the show in the late \u201980s  \u2014   hollering, \u201cBe more funny!\u201d In a withering review of Robert Altman\u2019s 2006 film, \u201cA Prairie Home Companion,\u201d Rex Reed called Mr. Keillor \u201ca myopic doughboy\u201d and his program \u201ca lumbering, affected and pointless audio curiosity. \u201d Yet Mr. Glass believes that many people mistake \u201cPrairie Home\u201d for quaint, homespun nostalgia, even though the tales from Lake Wobegon are, as often as not, richly emotional, contemporary and quite dark. In recent monologues, Mr. Keillor has lambasted the gun lobby, told of people\u2019s relatives being buried alive and mentioned a   suicidal woman left bald after she accidentally set her hair on fire in her gas oven, a presumably fictitious anecdote that is trademark Keillor: equal parts alarming, heartbreaking and funny. \u201cLike Howard Stern, Garrison Keillor created a packaging that nonlisteners took as real,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201cAnd the actual show is so much more complex, and human and complicated than nonlisteners think it is. \u201d Mr. Keillor has had health concerns, suffering a stroke in 2009, and, less than a week after the Minneapolis show, a seizure. But he insists it\u2019s his other projects that compelled him to step away. After July, he will continue to have a small radio foothold, hosting \u201cThe Writer\u2019s Almanac,\u201d a     radio program he started in the early \u201990s. And \u201cPrairie Home\u201d reruns will continue to air. Jon McTaggart, chief executive of American Public Media Group, the parent of American Public Media, said that as much as \u201cPrairie Home\u201d contributed financially, he has faith in the allure of the new version of the show and that \u201cthis transition has been planned for a while. \u201d Still, the future of \u201cPrairie Home Companion,\u201d and public radio, without Mr. Keillor remains somewhat of an open question. Mr. Keillor\u2019s handpicked successor, the folk musician Chris Thile, 35, who first performed on the show as a teenager, cheerfully admitted in an interview that it could all go down the drain if audiences reject him after he begins hosting on Oct. 15. Details are still being hammered out, but Mr. Thile plans to do musical numbers and comedy bits. There will be no Lake Wobegon. \u201cPublic radio always wondered what it was going to do when Garrison leaves,\u201d Mr. Nuzum said. \u201cIt\u2019s about to find out. \u201d For all his radio fame, Mr. Keillor has always seen himself first as a writer, though that legacy was largely overshadowed by the success of \u201cPrairie Home. \u201d Stripped of the sentimental trappings of the show, which he writes almost entirely by himself, Mr. Keillor\u2019s words leap off the page and bite. In an excoriating book review in The New York Times, he called   L\u00e9vy \u201ca French writer with a   prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore. \u201d Thrice wed  \u2014   he and his third wife, Jenny Lind Nilsson, a violinist, have a daughter, Maia, who just graduated from high school  \u2014   he once described marriage as \u201cthe deathbed of romance. \u201d Throughout his career, Mr. Keillor penned columns, stories and books. He wrote regularly for The New Yorker, where he had a desk, until Tina Brown\u2019s arrival as editor in 1992. \u201cThe day I heard that she would replace Bob Gottlieb, I packed up my stuff in a couple cardboard boxes and left in a cab and have not looked back,\u201d he said in an email. But it was radio, his Plan B, that came to define his life. Born in 1942 in Anoka, Minn. Mr. Keillor grew up the third of six children. His family was Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalist Christian sect that forbade dancing and going to the movies. But Mr. Keillor\u2019s youngest sister, Linda Keillor Berg, said theirs was a happy home, where family members routinely gathered to sing hymns. \u201cBecoming a star of any kind wasn\u2019t an ambition our parents seeded in any of us,\u201d Ms. Keillor Berg said, but Mr. Keillor could not be contained. In junior high, rather than signing poems with his given name, Gary, he began using the more regal sounding Garrison. It stuck. He went on to write for the local paper, majored in English at the University of Minnesota, and in 1969 took a job at a radio station as a classical music announcer. There, he began breaking from convention, interspersing Mozart overtures with songs by the Beach Boys and Grateful Dead. One morning, he aired a live predawn show featuring a cowboy singer and a performer who made wine glasses sing. He later asked his boss, Bill Kling, who founded Minnesota Public Radio and also started American Public Media, to weigh in. \u201cI said I thought it was awful, that it was one of the worst ways to wake up I had ever remembered,\u201d Mr. Kling said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, you know, it\u2019s a beginning. \u2019\u201d Mr. Keillor\u2019s big break came when his short, slyly racy short story about local parents hiring a   prostitute for their teenage son fell into the hands of Mr. Angell at The New Yorker. \u201cI thought it was brilliant,\u201d Mr. Angell said. \u201cThe nearest thing to E. B. White that had come along. \u201d It was Mr. Keillor\u2019s wildest dream come true. But it also made him miserable. \u201cWriting for the magazine put me in thrall to their reputation, to their style, to having fathers who were more talented than yourself,\u201d said Mr. Keillor who, at that time, was supporting his first wife and their son, Jason. He recalled sitting frozen at his typewriter in his bedroom in Minnesota, wondering, \u201cHow do you measure up to the gods?\u201d In 1974, The New Yorker gave him what would turn out to be a pivotal assignment, covering the Grand Ole Opry\u2019s final show at the Ryman Auditorium before its move to Opryland. Mr. Keillor was struck by the musicians\u2019 rapport, by Minnie Pearl\u2019s wry humor. He soon called Mr. Kling, telling him this was the kind of show they had to do back home. Scant months later, the first \u201cPrairie Home Companion\u201d was performed live in St. Paul before an audience of 12. Mr. Keillor\u2019s New Yorker colleagues were astonished, wondering how this painfully shy man could possibly host a radio show, let alone divert his energies from a burgeoning literary career. But Mr. Keillor adored the socializing, the camaraderie and the musicians\u2019 gregariousness and generosity. \u201cWith radio, I owned it. I owned it. Nobody else was doing this,\u201d Mr. Keillor said. \u201cYou find yourself on new ground, and you are so free. You are so free. \u201d Onstage, a new side of Mr. Keillor shone looser, less aloof, at times even jolly. Margaret Moos Pick, Mr. Keillor\u2019s early producer and former longtime girlfriend, said his Lake Wobegon monologues put him into something like a state of hypnosis. In them, he could lose himself. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily a happy man,\u201d Mr. Angell said, \u201cBut the time he is happy is when he is doing his monologue. \u201d As audiences embraced the show, more stations picked it up, and it began broadcasting nationally in 1980. Mr. Singer, a friend from The New Yorker, said the show appealed to baby boomers and felt like a counterweight to the Reagan era, when images of American life suddenly felt scripted and controlled. \u201cIt was an antidote to all that,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cThere was just a deeply wonderful feeling that this was speaking to many of us. \u201d Curiously, Mr. Keillor has always found it difficult spending so much time with the strong,   above average people of Lake Wobegon, which he based on his relatives, past and present. In \u201cThe Keillor Reader\u201d (2014) he complained bitterly about \u201ctheir industriousness, their infernal humility, their schoolmarmish sincerity, their earnest interest in you, their clich\u00e9s falling like clockwork  \u2014   it can be tiring to be around. \u201d Speaking on his porch, Mr. Keillor said of Lake Wobegonians, i. e. his relatives, \u201cI am frustrated by them in real life. \u201d They were too controlled by good manners, he said, and \u201chave a very hard time breaking through. \u201d So why devote so much of his professional life ruminating about them? \u201cIt\u2019s the people I think I know,\u201d he replied. Will he miss them, and the weekly jolt of the show? \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cNo. \u201d And yet. It was gloriously warm and sunny in Minneapolis for his last show there. In the State Theater, the audience  \u2014   nearly all white and   or older, the very Midwesterners Mr. Keillor has such a fraught yet close connection with  \u2014   packed the auditorium. After his show drew to a close, Mr. Keillor stayed onstage and began leading the audience in song, keeping them singing and swaying for perhaps half an hour. Then he stepped offstage and swept through the wings, heading toward the lobby, where he would greet his people like a preacher. He stood for photographs with fans for nearly two hours. As he passed by backstage, striding purposefully, he glanced at me, registered no recognition, and continued on, muttering, \u201cbomp, bomp, bomp, bomp. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561829.7425716}
