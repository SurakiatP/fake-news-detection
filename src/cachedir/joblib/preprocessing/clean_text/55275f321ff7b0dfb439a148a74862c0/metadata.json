Mattis, a   retired general who led a Marine division to Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, to serve as his secretary of defense. Mr. Trump made the announcement at a rally in Cincinnati, calling General Mattis \u201cthe closest thing we have to Gen. George Patton. \u201d General Mattis, 66, led the United States Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, from 2010 to 2013. His tour there was cut short by the Obama administration, which believed he was too hawkish on Iran. But his insistence that Iran is the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East, as well as his acerbic criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s initial efforts to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, made him an attractive choice for the incoming president. After retiring from the military, General Mattis told Congress that the administration\u2019s \u201cpolicy of disengagement in the Middle East\u201d had contributed to the rise of extremism in the region. The United States, he told lawmakers in 2015, needs to \u201ccome out from our reactive crouch and take a firm, strategic stance in defense of our values. \u201d But in some important policy areas, General Mattis differs from Mr. Trump, who has been filling the top ranks of his national security team with  . General Mattis believes, for instance, that Mr. Trump\u2019s conciliatory statements toward Russia are ill informed. General Mattis views with alarm Moscow\u2019s expansionist or bellicose policies in Syria, Ukraine and the Baltics. And he has told the   that torture does not work. Despite his tough stance on Iran, General Mattis also thinks that tearing up the Iran nuclear deal would hurt the United States, and he favors working closely with allies to strictly enforce its terms. After Mr. Trump met with General Mattis at Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey on Nov. 19, the   said on Twitter that he was \u201cvery impressive\u201d and \u201ca true general\u2019s general. \u201d On Thursday, Mr. Trump surprised the Cincinnati crowd with the announcement, saying: \u201cI gave up a little secret. \u201d He added that he would formally announce General Mattis\u2019s appointment on Monday. General Mattis, whose radio call sign during the invasion of Iraq was Chaos  \u2014   reflecting the havoc he sought to rain on adversaries  \u2014   has been involved in some of the United States\u2019   operations. As a   general, he led the first Marine force into Afghanistan a month after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and established Forward Operating Base Rhino near Kandahar. At times, General Mattis\u2019s salty language has gotten him into trouble. \u201cYou go into Afghanistan, you got guys that slap women around for five years because they didn\u2019t wear a veil,\u201d he said in 2005. \u201cSo it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. \u201d But the retired general, a lifelong bachelor who has said that he does not own a television and has often been referred to as a \u201cwarrior monk,\u201d is also famous for his extensive collection of books on military history. \u201cThanks to my reading, I have never been caught   by any situation,\u201d he wrote a colleague in 2003. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me all the answers, but it lights what is often a dark path ahead. \u201d General Mattis would be the first former ranking general to assume the post of defense secretary since George Marshall in  . He would need a special congressional waiver to serve as defense secretary. He retired from the Marines in 2013, and federal law stipulates that the Pentagon chief be out of uniform for seven years. But he has strong support in Congress, especially from John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In a recent phone call, Mr. McCain urged Mr. Trump to consider appointing General Mattis or Gen. Jack Keane, a retired Army vice chief of staff, as defense secretary. But General Keane has decided against returning to government in a   capacity. Mr. McCain said in a statement that General Mattis was \u201cwithout a doubt one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops. \u201d He added, \u201cAmerica will be fortunate to have General Mattis in its service once again. \u201d But Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and also a member of the Armed Services Committee, said that while she respected General Mattis\u2019s service, she would oppose a waiver to allow him to serve. \u201cCivilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy,\u201d she said in a statement. The selection of General Mattis is a boost for the Marines. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be working with Joseph F. Dunford, the   Marine general who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It would also create an unusual situation at the Pentagon because the new defense secretary would be General Dunford\u2019s former commanding officer. During the Iraq invasion, General Dunford was a colonel who led a Marine regiment that reported to General Mattis. General Mattis led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. He later commanded American troops during the   battle to retake Falluja from Sunni insurgents in 2004. As head of the Central Command, General Mattis was heavily involved in plans to counter Iran\u2019s military and protect the sea lanes in the Persian Gulf. William Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard and a staunch opponent of Mr. Trump\u2019s, sought to persuade General Mattis to mount an independent presidential bid. And he was courted by both the campaigns of Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton to speak at the political conventions, but declined. In a new book, \u201cWarriors and Citizens,\u201d which General Mattis edited with Kori Schake, a Hoover Institution fellow who served in the George W. Bush administration, he complained that politicians had relied too much on military commanders to make the case for their policies. \u201cPresident Bush left to Gen. David Petraeus the task of overcoming congressional opposition to the 2006 Iraq surge,\u201d General Mattis and Ms. Schake wrote. \u201cPresident Obama has been mostly silent on the war in Afghanistan since 2009 the case for continuing American troop presence has been made entirely by the military. \u201d Military commanders, they wrote, have a responsibility to carry out and advocate the president\u2019s policies. \u201cThis does not remove elected officials from the responsibility to win political arguments instead of depending on the military to do so,\u201d they added.'"}, "time": 1742561872.527098}
