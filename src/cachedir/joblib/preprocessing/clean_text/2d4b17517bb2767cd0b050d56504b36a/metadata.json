An uncharacterizable   story that\u2019s also about neoliberal economic reforms in Romania and the clash between the generation of 1968 and its capitalist children, the film is exceptional for another reason: It\u2019s hilarious. Germany has generally not been known for exporting comedies  \u2014   and, to outsiders, has a perhaps undeserved reputation for humorlessness  \u2014   but \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d which has been sold around the world, upends that. \u201cI said to my producer, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, this will not be a comedy, this will be a very long and sad film,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ade said in a recent interview. \u201cBut we were very happy that the comic aspect came out while editing. \u201d The film, which opened recently in New York, has been loved by critics since its debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May. It won no prizes there but recently made the shortlist for the   Academy Award, has been nominated for a Golden Globe, and won every top prize at the European Film Awards. (The New York Times\u2019s chief film critics, A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, included it in their year\u2019s best lists.) It tells the story of Ines (Sandra H\u00fcller) a   workaholic German management consultant posted to Bucharest, who receives an unexpected visit from her father, Winfried (Peter Simonischek) a music teacher and practical joker who eventually assumes the persona of \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d a life coach, and deploys a wig, fake teeth and whoopee cushions in a complex subterfuge to bring Ines back to her old self. In Germany, where \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d has been a   success for an   film, Ms. Ade (pronounced  ) 40, is seen as an outlier whose sui generis vision doesn\u2019t fit into any established comic traditions. She herself has said that her inspirations include the American comic Andy Kaufman, as well as the Hollywood films of Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder, and the Berlin theater troupe Gob Squad. \u201cIn Germany, mainstream comedies are rather vulgar,\u201d said Katja Nicodemus, the film critic at Die Zeit, a German weekly. \u201cMaren Ade, for me, is closer to Wilder and Lubitsch than to contemporary German comedy because she\u2019s closer to that deep humanism  \u2014   the masquerades, the salaciousness, the wit, the social critique of those comedies, in a subconscious way. \u201d \u201cFor me, what makes the film so exceptional is that it\u2019s a tragedy, where in this tragedy the father plays the comedy,\u201d Ms. Nicodemus added. While most German comedies tend toward   slapstick humor, \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d which is 162 minutes long, makes use of repetition and time, drawing out awkward moments to the point of comic discomfort. The film\u2019s kooky humor stands in contrast to Germany\u2019s top box office hit of the year, \u201cWelcome to the Hartmanns,\u201d a mainstream comedy about a wealthy Bavarian family adopting a Nigerian refugee  \u2014   touching on a   issue in Germany, where an influx of migrants has been testing society and the political establishment. Written and directed by Simon Verhoeven, that film has received mixed reviews (as well as criticism for posters that omitted Eric Kabongo, who plays the Nigerian) but it has also been praised for pulling off a complex feat. Mr. Verhoeven \u201cundertakes something that is very rarely achieved in German cinema,\u201d Wolfgang H\u00f6bel wrote in Der Spiegel. \u201cHe treats as uproarious entertainment a political and social conflict that has split the country into two somewhat irreconcilable camps: the   and those who are enemies of Angela Merkel\u2019s \u2018We can do this\u2019 slogan,\u201d Mr. H\u00f6bel added, referring to the statement by Ms. Merkel, the German chancellor, that Germany could handle the refugees. In an interview, Mr. Verhoeven agreed that his film was critical of Ms. Merkel. \u201cIt definitely is, because I am critical of her,\u201d he said, \u201cnot so much because I\u2019m critical of the basic direction that she led the country in, but I was in so many refugee homes, I saw how much people were struggling and how many people tried to help refugees, but there wasn\u2019t a master plan. There wasn\u2019t a vision of how it\u2019s going to work. \u201d \u201cWelcome to the Hartmanns\u201d has not received distribution overseas yet, and it\u2019s rare for a German comedy to find international success. Those that have include Tom Tykwer\u2019s 1999 hit, \u201cRun, Lola, Run,\u201d which isn\u2019t, strictly speaking, a comedy Sandra Nettelbeck\u2019s 2002 romantic comedy, \u201cMostly Martha,\u201d which was later remade by Hollywood with Catherine Zeta Jones and Wolfgang Becker\u2019s 2004 \u201cGood Bye, Lenin!\u201d Ms. Ade is the first director in what has been called the Berlin School  \u2014   a loose affiliation including Christian Petzold and other filmmakers who came of age in the 1990s and make closely observed dramas  \u2014   to delve into comedy. One of the great comic moments in \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d is a party scene in which Ines, on the spur of the moment, transforms a \u201cteam building\u201d brunch into what she calls \u201ca naked party\u201d  \u2014   stripping off her clothes and telling her guests, including her boss, to get naked, too. \u201cStanding in a bright room naked is really the worst thing that can happen to you,\u201d Ms. Ade said. \u201cThat was really courageous. I had a feeling the character is at a point where it\u2019s almost physically not possible for her to put on her clothes and go into that role again. \u201d She added: \u201cThis nakedness doesn\u2019t lower her status. She discovers while doing this that it raises her status it makes her independent again. \u201d While \u201cWelcome to the Hartmanns\u201d directly tackles a tough contemporary issue, \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d is also slyly political, about the differences between those in Winfried\u2019s generation, who came of age in the \u201960s and rebelled against parents from the Nazi era, and those of Ines\u2019s generation, who grew up in a   War capitalistic society. \u201cThey\u2019re very political they raised their children with a lot of human values,\u201d Ms. Ade said of Winfried\u2019s generation. \u201cHe wanted her to be free,  . They believe in a world without borders. Then he\u2019s confronted with things turned into the opposite. \u201d In using comedy, the film takes a new approach to German history. \u201cThe big myth in German cinema is that you have to wear a Nazi uniform to talk about the past, and it\u2019s more complicated,\u201d said Ms. Nicodemus, the Die Zeit film critic. \u201cToni\u201d also represents a change from the German films that normally appear on the international festival circuit: works by directors from the 1968 generation, including Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders. \u201cWhen the international film community thinks about German films, there are these old big \u201968 moviemaker heroes, and they stand for a certain seriousness and dealing with historic issues in Germany,\u201d said Tobias Kniebe, the chief film critic at S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a daily in Munich. Ms. Ade\u2019s film \u201ckind of broke a mold,\u201d Mr. Kniebe added. \u201cTo be able to make this kind of movie with that kind of complexity and accuracy and still get the big laughs and be the toast of Cannes, and sell it to more than 100 countries, that\u2019s kind of like saying now, if you\u2019re German, you can do anything. It\u2019s up to you, there\u2019s no prejudice anymore. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628599.8168495}
