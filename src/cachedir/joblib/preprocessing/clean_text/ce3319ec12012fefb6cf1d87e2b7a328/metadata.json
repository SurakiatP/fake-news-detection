Watch and listen as Penrose grapples at describing our consciousness in the video below, beginning at the 2:11 mark: \\n\u201cTo me, there is something outside the computational laws of physics. And when I wrote my book, \u2018The Emperor\u2019s New Mind,\u2019 I was trying to develop this idea, and I was trying to say, \u2018Well, there is something else out there.\u2019 What could it be? Where is the biggest gap in our understanding of physics? . . . most of these things don\u2019t have a direct bearing on what the brain does . . . . This big gap is within present-day quantum mechanics . . . maybe that gap is where the theory has to be outside a computational system.\u201d \\nAccording to Penrose and other physicists, our consciousness is \u201ca packet of information\u201d that\u2019s stored at a quantum or sub-atomic level in microtubules within human cells. When a person dies, his or her quantum information (or consciousness) leaves the body and is released into the universe, only to return to the body\u2019s cells if the host is brought back to life. Penrose argues that this explains why people can have near-death experiences, and believes that this quantum information amounts to a soul leaving the body : \\n\u201cIf the patient dies, it\u2019s possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body, perhaps indefinitely, as a soul.\u201d \\nFrom Wikipedia : \\n\u201cMicrotubules are a component of the cytoskeleton , [cellular skeleton] found throughout the cytoplasm . . . . The outer diameter of a microtubule is about 24 nm [nanometre * ] while the inner diameter is about 12 nm . . . . Microtubules are very important in a number of cellular processes. They are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell and, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments , they form the cytoskeleton . They also make up the internal structure of cilia and flagella .They provide platforms for intracellular transport and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the movement of secretory vesicles , organelles , and intracellular macromolecular assemblies (see entries for dynein and kinesin ). They are also involved in chromosome separation ( mitosis and meiosis ), and are the major constituents of mitotic spindles , which are used to pull apart eukaryotic chromosomes .\u201d \\n* Note: One nanometre is one-billionth of a metre. \\nDr. Hans-Peter D\u00fcrr , former head of Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, said: \\n\u201cWhat we consider the here and now, this world, it is actually just the material level that is comprehensible. The beyond is an infinite reality that is much bigger. The body dies but the spiritual quantum field continues. In this way, I am immortal.\u201d \\nAs reported four years ago by Australia\u2019s News.com on Oct. 31, 2012, Sir Roger Penrose and Dr. Stuart Hameroff , Professor Emeritus at the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychology and Director of the Center of Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona, developed a quantum theory of consciousness asserting that our souls are contained inside structures called microtubules within our brain cells. Our experience of consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects inside these microtubules \u2013 a process they call orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR). In a near-death experience the microtubules lose their quantum state, but the information within them is not destroyed. Or in layman\u2019s terms, the soul does not die but returns to the universe. \\nDr Hameroff explained the theory at length in the documentary Through the Wormhole , which was aired on the Science Channel: \\n\u201cThe quantum information within the microtubules is not destroyed, it can\u2019t be destroyed, it just distributes and dissipates to the universe at large. If the patient is resuscitated, revived, this quantum information can go back into the microtubules and the patient says \u2018I had a near death experience\u2019. [If the patient dies, it is] possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body indefinitely \u2013 as a soul.\u201d \\nSee also:'"}, "time": 1742562276.2005537}
