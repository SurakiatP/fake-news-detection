[Speaking to Bloomberg, Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, discussed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and the division of his time between Twitter and his other company Square. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve tolerated having a shared CEO is remarkable given the situation they\u2019re in,\u201d he said, \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a situation of investor indifference  \u2014   everyone is used to Twitter\u2019s troubles by now. \u201d  The company\u2019s earnings for the fourth quarter were $717 million, falling short of Wall Street predictions of $740 million. Twitter\u2019s sales growth of 1% slowed dramatically from the 48% gain for the same quarter last year. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral believes this will be a big issue for Twitter in the coming year: \u201cSales growth recovery for Twitter will be very challenging in 2017. Google and Facebook results show robust ad environment in the fourth quarter. \u201d Waral stated that Twitter\u2019s sales growth \u201cis showing their strategies are not working. \u201d Twitter has been relying on live video partnerships with larger brands such as Dick Clark Productions in recent months in an attempt to attract more users to their platform, a move that hasn\u2019t seemed to yield much success. The company also introduced new video ad monetization features, allowing  to be played before videos. However, advertising revenue decreased from the year previously, with the company reporting revenue of $638 million. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt  Co. believes that although Twitter has carved out a niche in the political world, \u201cIt\u2019s still in an identity crisis. People that use Twitter get it, the world conceptually gets it, but your average potential user doesn\u2019t. \u201d Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, however, currently has no plans to step down as CEO of Square, saying, \u201cThis focus, and this team, allows me and gives me a lot of confidence I can continue to focus on the meaningful things at both companies and we have the right prioritization in front of us. \u201d \u201cLate last year, we really flattened the org  \u2026     so I could be closer to the product,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve spent a year going through and making sure we reset the foundation on what we\u2019re executing and what our priorities are, we have a lot more confidence that we can move a lot faster on bigger things. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
