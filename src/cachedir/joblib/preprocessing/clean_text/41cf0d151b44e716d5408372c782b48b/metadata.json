Rand Paul ( ) said the reactions on the left to President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change were \u201calarmist\u201d and  \u201cridiculous. \u201d  Paul said, \u201cWe should try to constrain pollution. We should try to control pollution. I think we\u2019ve been doing that for 50 or 60 years. And I think we should continue. But your previous guest sounded like, my goodness, the sky is falling, mass extinction. Really? I don\u2019t think we should be alarmists about this. The planet is 4. 5 billion years old. We have gone through great extremes of climate change natural and now we may have   influence as well. \u201d  \u201cBut these people, the question I always ask the alarmists is how much is nature and how much is man?\u201d he continued. \u201cThey act as if it\u2019s a given that man is the only source of climate change. My goodness, the great climate changes in our history happened before the industrial revolution. So is there climate change could man have an impact? Yes, but let\u2019s not be such alarmists that if we don\u2019t sign the Paris accord that there\u2019s going to be mass extinction? That\u2019s a ridiculous statement. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563071.5890052}
