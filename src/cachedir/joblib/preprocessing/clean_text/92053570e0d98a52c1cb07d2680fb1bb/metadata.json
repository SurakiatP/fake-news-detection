New WikiLeaks emails suggest John Podesta attended a \u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d dinner party at Marina Abramovich\u2019s house. \\nVia YourNewsWire \\n\\nGiven what we know about the performance artist\u2019s occult fascination, it\u2019s safe to assume they weren\u2019t saying the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\\n\\nSo what happened at this dinner party? Marina Abramovich demonstrates what Spirit Cooking is in a YouTube video. Painting a wall with pig blood, Abramovich smears the sentence \u201cWITH A SHARP KNIFE CUT DEEPLY INTO THE MIDDLE FINGER OF YOUR LEFT HAND EAT THE PAIN.\u201d Another daubed message reads \u201cFRESH MORNING URINE SPRINKLE OVER NIGHTMARE DREAMS.\u201d\\nAnramovich then throws blood over a small statue in the corner of the room, before writing \u201cSPIRIT COOKING.\u201d Blood is then ceremoniously run around the four corners of the room. Another message on the wall reads \u201cMIX FRESH BREAST MILK WITH FRESH SPERM MILK DRINK ON EARTHQUAKE NIGHTS.\u201d\\nAt 7 mins 30 Abramovich is seen in a projected video with a snake wrapped around her head, it\u2019s tail in her nostril. Warning: in case you hadn\u2019t guessed, this video contains graphic content.\\nSpirit Cooking, according to article about Marina Abramovich, \u201c is about the conversion of matter into energy, of the material into the spiritual. Abramovic derives her inspiration from the popular belief that the spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid, but in the form of light, sound and emotions. \\nThis superstition is found in numerous cultures and there are even strict rules as to how this spiritual fare should be prepared. In this paradox, in the material underpinning of something immaterial, the physical and spiritual worlds meet. \\nOr to use her own words, \u2018When you make something visible for something invisible, the invisible becomes visible.\u2019 \u201c Marina Abramovich has long been associated with the occult. Her performance art often features Satanic themes and mock human sacrifice.\\nHere she is performing with Jay-Z \u2013 a man not shy about proclaiming Satanic beliefs.\\nPerhaps we we shouldn\u2019t be surprised Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager John Podesta attends Satanic Spirit Cooking dinners. After all, Hillary Clinton appears to have banned use of the word \u201cGod\u201d during her campaign. Watch this woman struggle with her natural instincts while Hillary smiles knowingly at her side.\\n'"}, "time": 1742628581.4472177}
