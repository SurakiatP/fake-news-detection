But presidential leadership does not appear to be forthcoming, leaving the party largely paralyzed at a moment it had thought would be full of legislative activity. \u201cThe White House is huge,\u201d said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota. \u201cThe president is the only person who can sign a bill into law, so he\u2019s the guy that ultimately holds the whip hand when it comes to this getting done. \u201d As congressional leaders struggle to clear the first major legislative hurdle of the Trump era  \u2014   a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  \u2014   their talks with the White House, though not infrequent, have failed to advance any coherent, cohesive policy prescription. Repealing the health care law is the Republicans\u2019 first step toward enacting their broader agenda. So far, President Trump, seeking to project an image of a man of action, has preferred   executive actions over   engagement with Congress. In the absence of presidential leadership, the most fiscally conservative House Republicans have stepped forward to demand that the health care law be whittled to near nothingness. More moderate senators are insisting on a replacement plan with many of the current law\u2019s popular components. Both sides are pressing hard to sway lawmakers working on draft legislation that would roll back the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, replace the subsidies offered in the insurance marketplaces with tax credits to buy coverage, and eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have health insurance. After weeks of loud protests across the country from voters who are fearful of losing their health care, Republican governors complicated matters further this week by joining Democrats in a call for a replacement plan that would ensure coverage for the 20 million Americans who gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear a renewed commitment to repealing the law,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah  \u2014   another sign of just how far the party is from unity. Democrats, who have been dismissed as obstructionists by Republicans determined to repeal and replace the law without them, are sitting by quietly waiting for those efforts to fail. At that point, Democrats believe, Republicans will have to reach across the aisle and repair the law. \u201cWe\u2019ve maintained all along there is room to negotiate,\u201d said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. \u201cBut only if they abandon their attempt to repeal the law. \u201d While he has seen no moves toward cooperation yet, \u201cthey are in a world of hurt,\u201d Mr. Schatz said of Republicans, \u201cbecause none of their plans add up, and their members are starting to figure this out and the public is starting to figure this out, and they don\u2019t have Obama as a foil anymore. I think they need to fail first. \u201d Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who has long offered to help fix the law, said she had heard from only one Republican colleague, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, since the end of last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think Republicans have decided what they\u2019re waiting for,\u201d she said. \u201cThe White House or Godot. \u201d Many Republicans seem to be resigned to seeking consensus on health care legislation, as well as on a budget and tax reform, without comprehensive White House guidance. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he was relying less on a signal from Mr. Trump than on    discussions between lawmakers and the administration to \u201cget the details filled in. \u201d Those details include how Mr. Trump plans to fund his call for a 10 percent increase in military spending, Mr. McCaul said. \u201cFrom a budget standpoint, these numbers are difficult to crunch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as Republicans want a stronger national defense. That money\u2019s got to come from someplace. That\u2019s where the hard decisions have to be made. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s aversion to making big changes to two of the costliest government programs, Medicare and Social Security  \u2014   something Republicans generally crave  \u2014   is not helping matters. \u201cThat makes it even more difficult,\u201d Mr. McCaul said. The president\u2019s budget outline, unveiled this week, has something for almost every Republican to hate, from the lack of   entitlement reform to large proposed cuts at the State Department. \u201cSpeaking for myself,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, \u201cI think the diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important, and you get results a lot cheaper, frequently, than you do on the defense side. So, speaking for myself, I\u2019m not in favor\u201d of huge reductions at the State Department. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called those cuts \u201cdead in the water\u201d for him. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s direct contributions to the legislative process have happened through the news media, as he has signaled his priorities in interviews that have sometimes left congressional Republicans scrambling to decipher his intentions. Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, said some of his Republican colleagues were frustrated by their inability to move forward. \u201cThey\u2019re reading about what he wants to do at the same time I am in the paper,\u201d he said. Six weeks after Mr. Trump said Republicans would provide a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act that offered \u201cinsurance for everybody,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is fighting to reconcile his party\u2019s competing priorities while also contending with the occasional messaging complication from the White House. \u201cThis is a plan that we are all working on together: the House, the Senate, the White House,\u201d Mr. Ryan said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re all working on this together with the administration. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562143.2269068}
