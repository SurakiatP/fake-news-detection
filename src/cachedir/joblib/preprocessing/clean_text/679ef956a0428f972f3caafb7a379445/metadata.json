The usher who seated them, sizing them up as   worshipers, asked what had brought them to Marble, as the church is known. \u201cThey said, \u2018We understand this is where Marla Maples met Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d recalled the choir director and organist at the time, Kevin Walters, \u201c\u2018so we thought we\u2019d come and see if we could hook up with a billionaire, too. \u2019\u201d For all that has been written about Mr. Trump\u2019s   careers  \u2014   as a real estate developer, a casino owner and a   personality  \u2014   relatively little attention has been focused on the role religion played in shaping his personality. Overlooked amid tabloid accounts of his romances or   articles about his ups and downs are the periods in his life when he was going to church, first as a regular at a Presbyterian church in Queens, where he grew up, and later, as a less frequent worshiper at Marble, one of America\u2019s oldest and most famous churches. Mr. Trump, now the Republican nominee for president, had an intriguing relationship with Marble. He attended its Sunday services for almost 50 years, but says he does not know if he ever formally joined the church. He describes himself as a Presbyterian, but Marble is not a Presbyterian church  \u2014   it is part of the Reformed Church in America, a separate denomination that traces its beginnings to 1628 and the first ordained minister in New Amsterdam, as New York was then known. Mr. Trump married his first wife, Ivana, at Marble, in a ceremony performed by one of America\u2019s most famous ministers, the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale. His marriage to Ms. Maples was performed by Dr. Peale\u2019s successor, the Rev. Arthur Caliandro, who, like Mr. Trump, was married three times. After Mr. Trump mentioned Marble on the campaign trail, the church took the unusual step last year of issuing a statement that he was not \u201can active member. \u201d The current minister says it released the statement not to dissociate itself from someone whose connection was to some members awkward, even embarrassing, but \u201cto share accurate information. \u201d Mr. Trump said the statement did not upset him because, he said, it was correct: \u201cI haven\u2019t been back since Dr. Caliandro passed away,\u201d three years ago at age 79. In the 1950s  \u2014   when Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, was building a   apartment dynasty in Brooklyn and Queens  \u2014   the Trumps were prominent parishioners at a church close to their home, First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens. Like Marble, it is a church with a history: It describes itself as the oldest continuously worshiping Presbyterian congregation in the country. Mr. Trump was confirmed there in 1959, around the time he turned 13. \u201cHe sang the songs and did the works,\u201d said John Walter, a cousin of Donald Trump who is the family historian. But in the 1960s, the Trumps gravitated to Marble. The lure was Dr. Peale, a household name since the publication of the 1952 best seller that transformed \u201cthe power of positive thinking\u201d into a national catchphrase. Today he is remembered for preaching optimism and personal fulfillment, asserting that it was possible to achieve spiritual and material success in life. He himself became a wealthy man who lived on Fifth Avenue opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Walter said Fred Trump maintained that \u201cnobody else was Peale. \u201d That idea was echoed by Donald Trump, who in an interview described Dr. Peale as \u201ca great preacher and a great public speaker\u201d but said nothing about any religious beliefs he had imparted. \u201cYou always, when the service was over, you said, \u2018I\u2019d have sat there for another hour,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump recalled. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many people like that. It wasn\u2019t the speaking ability, it was the thought process. \u201d Some theologians criticized Dr. Peale\u2019s brand of Christianity as superficial. The current senior minister, Dr. Michael B. Brown, suggested that there were really two Norman Vincent Peales  \u2014   \u201cPeale the motivator and Peale the pastor\u201d  \u2014   and that Dr. Peale\u2019s ministry at Marble is often misunderstood because \u201ca lot of the public thinks Peale the pastor was saying the same stuff as Peale the motivator. \u201d \u201cIn the motivational speaking world,\u201d Dr. Brown added, \u201che would say, \u2018You can if you think you can.\u2019 In the pulpit, he would quote Philippians 4 and say, \u2018I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. \u2019\u201d Still, Dr. Peale\u2019s presence made Marble a favorite of business leaders, and he helped influence the way Mr. Trump takes on the world. \u201cEverything he does is about winning,\u201d Gwenda Blair, the author of \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate,\u201d a biography of the family, said in a recent New York Times podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s only about winning and losing  \u2014   those two are the only principles that are involved. That\u2019s a very Norman Vincent Peale notion  \u2014   that notion of success above all. \u201d Dr. Peale favored Republicans  \u2014   in 1956, he assailed the Democratic presidential candidate, Adlai E. Stevenson, because he had been divorced. Mr. Stevenson countered, \u201cI find the Apostle Paul appealing and the Apostle Peale appalling. \u201d In 1960, when John F. Kennedy was the Democratic nominee, Dr. Peale and 25 other Protestant leaders were so fearful of Vatican influence on a Kennedy administration that they gathered at the invitation of the Rev. Billy Graham and discussed ways to defeat him. Dr. Peale was attacked for his involvement and later called the episode one of the most painful of his life. (Richard M. Nixon worshiped at Marble after he lost to Kennedy, and Dr. Peale supported him even as the Watergate scandal doomed his presidency.) If Mr. Trump admired Dr. Peale, the minister, too, professed admiration for Mr. Trump. In 1983, Dr. Peale sent Mr. Trump a note  \u2014   shared by the Trump campaign  \u2014   congratulating him on the opening of Trump Tower. Dr. Peale recalled predicting that \u201cyou were going to be America\u2019s greatest builder. \u201d \u201cYou have already arrived at that status,\u201d Dr. Peale wrote, \u201cand believe me, as your friend, I am very proud of you. \u201d But Dr. Peale\u2019s son John, 79, told The Washington Post in January that he was not pleased when Mr. Trump referred to his father. \u201cI don\u2019t respect Mr. Trump very much,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cI don\u2019t think the image of Norman Vincent Peale that comes through Donald Trump is any connection to the idea I have of him. \u201d In a brief telephone conversation last month, however, John Peale said that he no longer winced at the mention of Mr. Trump. But he would not elaborate. \u201cI\u2019ve said all I need or want to say,\u201d he said. Dr. Brown said that Marble, which is no longer a strictly denominational congregation, was \u201cthe sort of place church is supposed to be. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s inclusive,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether you\u2019re talking about race, age, politics, sexuality, economics or gender. \u201d Asked whether that contrasts with many of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign, he said, \u201cThere is a difference in the world of politics and the world of church, and in the world of church, we are compelled by Jesus\u2019s commandment  \u2014   it wasn\u2019t a suggestion or a request  \u2014   it was, I command that you love one another. \u201d Dr. Peale stopped preaching at Marble in 1984, when he was 86 Mr. Trump said that he attended Dr. Peale\u2019s last service. His successor, Dr. Caliandro, presided over a campaign to remodel the church\u2019s Fifth Avenue home, built in the 1850s with marble from the same quarry as City Hall and the arch in Washington Square Park. Dr. Caliandro\u2019s son Paul said his father told of trying to get Mr. Trump to contribute to a new roof. \u201cMy father is walking down the aisle in the middle of the sanctuary,\u201d Paul Caliandro said. \u201cDonald Trump is telling him things to finish the work, do this and this and this. He asks for his financial support, and Donald Trump says: \u2018I just gave it to you. I saved you $100, 000. \u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said he did not remember whether he was asked to contribute money for the roof, or whether he had done so. He said he had \u201chelped them with their real estate through Dr. Caliandro and earlier through Dr. Peale. \u201d \u201cI was very helpful, I know I was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were thankful. \u201d By the early 1990s, some in the congregation wondered if he was paying attention to more than the sermons. \u201cI had a particular pew I had to sit in, and one Sunday, the usher said, \u2018Would you please move over? \u2019\u201d recalled Gloria Hegy, Dr. Caliandro\u2019s first wife. The woman who squeezed in apparently liked the view from that pew. \u201cMarla Maples wasn\u2019t interested in sitting beside me,\u201d Ms. Hegy said. \u201cShe was interested in Donald, who was sitting in the balcony. They kept looking at each other. \u201d Mr. Trump said that contrary to what the two women had told the usher  \u2014   and contrary to a famous tabloid headline, \u201cThey Met in Church\u201d  \u2014   his first encounter with Ms. Maples was not at Marble. But as the relationship developed, so did the awkwardness for some at the church. \u201cPeople would ask me about it,\u201d said the Rev. Anne Benefield, who was an associate minister at Marble in the 1990s. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Does Donald Trump really come?\u2019 and I would have to say, \u2018  .\u2019 This was really embarrassing, that this man was married and having this   affair and the church was connected with it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562536.5231514}
