Trump ran virtually parallel campaigns on Monday as they geared up for the final stretch of the presidential race. She made nice with the news media by opening up her campaign plane and chatting with reporters. He followed suit, inviting a smaller group of reporters onto his plane and answering questions during the   flight. She took along her running mate, and so did he, as both focused on Ohio and nearly crossed paths in Cleveland. Their motorcades all but passed each other, and all four candidates\u2019 planes ended up on the tarmac at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport at the same time. Mrs. Clinton moved on several fronts on Monday to confront nagging doubts about her candidacy, despite her comfortable lead in many   polls. Courting labor supporters, she met with union leaders in Cleveland while her husband, Bill Clinton, appeared at a Labor Day parade in Detroit. Seeking the backing of progressive voters, she enlisted her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who made his first solo appearance on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behalf at a rally in New Hampshire. And her outreach to reporters included her most extensive    session with them in months. She expressed alarm \u201cabout the credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections\u201d through hacking, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process. \u201d Not to be outdone, Mr. Trump used his airborne meeting with reporters to clarify his views on immigration, saying he opposed any path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. But he did not explicitly rule out a   path to legal status if the nation\u2019s immigration system is overhauled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make that decision into the future,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But, he added, \u201cto become a citizen, you are going to have to go out and come back in through the process. You\u2019re going to have to go out and get in line. This isn\u2019t touchback. You have to get in line. \u201d On the plane, Mr. Trump also told reporters that, \u201cas of this moment,\u201d he planned to attend all three debates, and that only a \u201cnatural disaster\u201d could make him change his mind. He added that, while he was preparing, he was not holding mock debate sessions. Labor Day is traditionally the beginning of a   sprint to Election Day, in which candidates try to seize voters\u2019 attention as summer fades and debates loom. Monday was no exception. The visits to Ohio by Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   along with their respective running mates, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia  \u2014   highlighted the importance of a state that Republicans believe Mr. Trump must win to have any shot of reaching the White House. \u201cLabor Day comes, and it\u2019s kind of like a recalibration,\u201d said Beth Myers, who managed Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and served as his senior adviser in 2012. \u201cYou see the finish line, you see that there\u2019s not too many   events left, and most campaigns take a measure of where you are on Labor Day. \u201d This cycle, however, both candidates have eschewed traditional campaigning, albeit in divergent ways. Normally, they would already have been circling each other in swing states. But Mrs. Clinton has spent most of the summer away from the campaign trail, focusing on   in places like the Hamptons and Beverly Hills with celebrities like Jimmy Buffett and Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Trump has also kept a languid pace, favoring large rallies, often in the evening, over several daily stops. Mr. Trump, a political novice, and Mrs. Clinton, a veteran politician, are confronting historically low approval ratings among voters for whom they are   commodities. \u201cLabor Day used to be this big, important marker in the campaign season,\u201d said Amy Walter, the national editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cA kickoff, if you will. Today, it feels like the start of the third quarter instead of the kickoff. \u201d \u201cThe candidates are   the ads have been running for months and TVs have been saturated with talking heads,\u201d she added. Mr. Trump tried to burnish his image as a statesman last week with a hastily arranged trip to Mexico City. He has also tried to increase his outreach to minorities, from a promised \u201csoftening\u201d on immigration that concluded with a fiery, nativist speech in Phoenix, to a stop at a black church in Detroit. That approach was also on display on Monday. At a diner in Cleveland, Mr. Trump met Maria Hernandez, a   who said she was supporting him. \u201c  supports Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice. \u201d Then he turned to the nearby reporters to emphasize his focus group of one: \u201cMake a note of it, guys,\u201d he said. Earlier, speaking to a dozen white men and a lone white woman at an American Legion post here, Mr. Trump criticized China\u2019s treatment of President Obama: When the president landed in Hangzhou for the Group of 20 summit meeting, the host country forced him to disembark from the plane\u2019s belly. Mr. Trump said he would not have gotten off the plane, but instead would have urged his crew to \u201cget out of here. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appearance in Cleveland was meant as a show of labor support during a campaign in which many    union members were drawn to Mr. Sanders\u2019s promise to take on income inequality. At a Labor Day festival here, she and Mr. Kaine were joined by the A. F. L. . I. O. \u2019s president, Richard L. Trumka Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the first unions to endorse Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s surrogates were also out in force. In Pittsburgh, Mr. Kaine and the man he hopes to succeed, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke at a rally before the city\u2019s Labor Day parade. Mr. Kaine assailed Mr. Trump for refusing to release his tax returns, then turned the stage over to Mr. Biden. \u201cMy name is Joe Biden, and I work for Hillary Clinton and whatever the hell this guy\u2019s name is,\u201d he said. Mr. Sanders, at a rally in Lebanon, N. H. praised Mrs. Clinton for supporting a host of progressive positions. \u201cI would hope and ask you all, very much, that we have got to do everything we can to make sure that Hillary Clinton is elected president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut two days after the election, we have got to continue the pressure. \u201d Addressing an issue that has dogged the campaign, Mr. Clinton defended the Clinton Foundation. And he criticized Mr. Trump over his own foundation, referring to a Washington Post report that found that his charitable organization paid the Internal Revenue Service a $2, 500 penalty this year after improperly giving a political contribution to a campaign group with ties to the attorney general of Florida, Pam Bondi. Mr. Trump discussed the issue in his talk with reporters aboard his plane. He denied any impropriety on either his part or Ms. Bondi\u2019s concerning the $25, 000 donation. At the time of the donation in 2013, Ms. Bondi was considering whether to investigate Trump University for fraud. In the end, she did not do so. \u201cI never spoke to her, first of all, she\u2019s a fine person beyond reproach,\u201d he said when asked about the controversy. \u201cI never even spoke to her about it at all. She\u2019s a fine person. Never spoken to her about it. Never. \u201d Many attorneys general besides Ms. Bondi, he said, decided against pursuing any action regarding Trump University. \u201cI\u2019ll win that case in court,\u201d he said. \u201cMany turned that down. \u201d \u201cI never spoke to her,\u201d he added, again referring to Ms. Bondi. When asked what he expected to get out of the donation, he would only say: \u201cI\u2019ve just known Pam Bondi for years. I have a lot of respect for her. Never spoke to her about that at all. I just have a lot of respect for her, and she\u2019s very popular. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563200.7474933}
