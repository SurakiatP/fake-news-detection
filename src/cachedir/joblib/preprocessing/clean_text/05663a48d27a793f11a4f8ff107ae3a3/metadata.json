His method of deciphering right from wrong was pretty simple\u2026 he looked for the truth. \\nThe question he asked himself was: \u201cWhat common traits bind Clinton supporters together?\u201d \\nYou\u2019re going to fully support the answer he came up with\u2026 \\nCheck this out! \\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms. Have a Trump sign in your lawn? They will steal it. If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car. \\nIf you speak of Trump at work you could get fired. On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message\u2026We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it. We also know Clinton\u2019s side hired paid trolls to bully online. You don\u2019t hear much about that\u2026\u201d \\nSee what happens for people that actually \u201cthink\u201d things through? They come up with logical answers and start off on whatever endeavor they are facing on the right foot! \\nHe\u2019s absolutely right! Clinton followers tend to yell and judge everyone else for \u201csins\u201d that they themselves are living in as they are pointing the finger at others! All things racist, sexist, bigoted, and telling us all we are these things because we lack tolerance, when in fact, that isn\u2019t the case at all\u2026is BULLYING! \\nWhich is rather IRONIC don\u2019t you think? Because they also go on and on about how they are against bullying and we all need to be tolerant. Yet are constantly inciting violence, and condoning intimidation towards ALL who do not agree with them. \\nHere\u2019s the endorsement, and it\u2019s glorious. \\n\u201cI endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I don\u2019t defend Trump\u2019s personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Let\u2019s call that a tie, at worst. Today I put Trump\u2019s odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldn\u2019t win unless \u2018something changed.\u2019 Something just changed.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s right. Trump is no angel, but Hillary is Satan. Trump loves America and for now, in the state we are in, that\u2019s going to do a WHOLE lot of good. Some feel this election is about picking your poison, which is the least potent. I believe, it\u2019s about picking what\u2019s best for America. First step\u2026would be choosing someone who loves this country. After 8 years of being under the reign of someone who hates this country, this should be clear. \\nBecause this is the alternative\u2026 Related Items'"}, "time": 1742562716.3519855}
