Amy Haimerl and her husband, Karl Kaebnick, fell hard for Detroit and thought they could make their own dream of financial freedom come true when they moved here in 2013. But this is what happened: They put more than $400, 000 (including all of their retirement savings) into a       home in the city\u2019s West Village neighborhood that was most recently appraised at just $300, 000. They claim, however, to be 100 percent satisfied and genuinely happy. Which raises a question: Are they insane? Ms. Haimerl\u2019s book about their migration and renovation adventure, \u201cDetroit Hustle,\u201d will be out on May 3. It\u2019s a love song sung to a house and a city, but it\u2019s also a money memoir, one marked by ignorance at the outset and a triumph of feelings over financial facts. It does not end in ruin, but it does end in debt. So let\u2019s start with those facts. Ms. Haimerl, who is 40, and Mr. Kaebnick, 44, had about $10, 000 in liquid assets when they decided to move. They settled on a house on a block where only two homes were boarded up. They bought the smaller one, a wreck with no wires or radiators or doors or pipes, for $35, 000, liquidating Ms. Haimerl\u2019s retirement account to close without a mortgage. \u201cThere is essentially nothing left inside the walls,\u201d she writes in her book. \u201cWhat we have is a pile of bricks with character. \u201d For the renovation, they were counting on the $110, 000 that would be left from Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s accounts. The previous owners had figured it would take $150, 000 or so to make it habitable. What could go wrong? Well, the couple was missing two crucial bits of knowledge, one about the Detroit market and the other about themselves. First, they realized only after they had bought the house that there were no construction loans available. That was because there wasn\u2019t any evidence that after renovation, homes like theirs would be worth more than what it would cost to fix them. So whatever work the couple wanted to do, they would have to pay for it themselves. Then, they could try to get a mortgage after the work was done and take out cash to repay any other debts they incurred along the way. And it turned out that there were a lot of those debts, in part because the couple misjudged the amount of work they would need and want to do. They started by looking at options for doing just $100, 000 of work, but that might have forced them to move in without any water. The only contractor who made them feel comfortable figured it would take $300, 000. He went to work, and they ended up spending $400, 000 total, not including the purchase price. You\u2019ve heard versions of this story before, but the specifics here involved a balcony from a crumbling church that made incredible wainscoting but begged for matching custom woodwork and installation that eventually cost $65, 000. So they borrowed $75, 000 from Ms. Haimerl\u2019s father and $40, 000 from her grandparents and aunt. Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s family chipped in with kitchen appliances in lieu of a wedding or a gift, and the rest came from a $25, 000 Lending Club loan, $50, 000 in USAA personal loans and some credit card debt. The result is by no means extravagant, though it is a lot of space for two people with no designs on having children. The interior trim is bare, and the house still needs paint in many rooms. It\u2019s missing a porch, and the garage out back is crumbling. On paper, Ms. Haimerl is about the last person you would expect to go all in like this. She grew up poor and lost a house to a foreclosure in Denver several years ago, when a previous relationship disintegrated. She has even worked as a personal finance editor. The money scold in me believes she should have known better, but she believes she knows plenty. \u201cAs a contractor\u2019s daughter, I grew up with men who want to do it right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t skimp on work now because you pay for it later. \u201d So they shored up the roof and rebuilt the rear of the structure. Then, there is her take on retirement. Her father had $75, 000 to lend to her because he had been forced to liquidate a   business that he built after the family\u2019s earlier lean years. \u201cI never grew up with any idea that there would be retirement,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were trying not to go to a payday lender. My dad\u2019s retirement was supposed to be the business. \u201d Ms. Haimerl is a writer and Mr. Kaebnick is a computer programmer, and perhaps they can work well into their 70s or 80s. In the meantime, their net worth is negative. They did get a mortgage after the work was done, and the appraiser assigned the $300, 000 value to their home, a triumph in their neighborhood at the time. They pulled most of that money out in a mortgage to repay many of their other debts and write a giant check to their contractor, Calvin Garfield. They still owe him about $80, 000, but aspiring Detroit residents should not expect loose terms if they come to town. \u201cI\u2019m confident other contractors would not have made the same call,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cBut I do think everyone we have done business with has become a friend, and in that mix of things, this seemed to be the right thing to do. \u201d The couple desperately wants to repay him, and because their income is just over $100, 000, they expect to do so sooner rather than later. Ms. Haimerl freelances, and they have an Airbnb side business going using some of that 3, 000 square feet. For just $65 a night, aspiring Detroit residents can soak up plenty of   advice and bear witness to the kind of house that a lot of money and worry can buy. But how best to explain away their lack of retirement savings? Plenty of people who sank their life savings into real estate in less desirable parts of Brooklyn or San Francisco a decade or two ago are probably thrilled. So is that how they think about the money they have put into their Detroit dream? That they bet on a city instead of a bunch of stocks? \u201cWe have gotten   about talking that way,\u201d Ms. Haimerl said. \u201cPeople here say, \u2018How dare you treat our city like an investment. \u2019\u201d Mr. Kaebnick said he understood the sentiment. \u201cSo many people who stuck it out here for so long never had anything to show for it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, we might come across as privileged newcomers who are going to ride it to the bank. \u201d In fact, they are true believers who love the city enough to go all in and then some. Others have found their own way of demonstrating their commitment to the city, and at least one of them, Drew Philp, is writing his own book about the house he bought for $500 and fixed up without borrowing anything. His BuzzFeed story about the experience describes the two winters he had without much, if any, heat, among many other unsettling experiences. Families without the means for $400, 000 investments or the fortitude to see their breath indoors can buy houses that have electricity and running water for half that amount or less. And a new program called Detroit Home Mortgage aims to make it possible for people to get loans before they start their renovations. In the meantime, Ms. Haimerl and Mr. Kaebnick have not found financial freedom in Detroit, though they insist that they are so much richer for having moved. In a poignant moment early in her book, Ms. Haimerl describes gazing longingly into a window in a newly gentrified Denver neighborhood, before her dream of homeownership there turned into a nightmare. The living room looked like luxury, a place where the residents weren\u2019t constantly hustling to hold things together. Aspiring homeowners in Detroit may well walk down her street someday soon, see her through the window and wonder how she had it so good. Would they be jealous? Should they be? \u201cI thought maybe that once you were inside the window, you didn\u2019t have to hustle,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the truth is, we\u2019re all hustling. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564570.6174402}
