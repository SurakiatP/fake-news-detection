Massimo Costantini, the coach of the United States table tennis team, called the formation \u201ca sort of homage to the fallen. \u201d They appeared on the first day of the Olympics, in a far corner of the table tennis pavilion: 18 white balls, all of them crumpled or cracked, arranged ceremoniously in the center of a quartet of water bottles. It was a fitting symbol of the frustration that has festered at the tables this week at the Rio Games, where the table tennis balls are giving players fits. They do not bounce true, the players said. Their flight paths are unpredictable. And they frequently break. \u201cI think this ball is very bad,\u201d Li Ping of Qatar said after losing a match. The player who beat him, Dimitrij Ovtcharov of Germany, fumed that the official competition ball \u201cmakes it almost impossible to compete. \u201d Table tennis balls are capricious little things. Infinitesimal variations in size and imperceptible deviations in construction can have considerable ramifications for how they spin, fly and bounce. Casual players  \u2014   people in suburban garages or fraternity houses  \u2014   tend not to notice such details. But professionals obsess over them. The balls at the Olympics, then, are not the ones you find, cobwebbed, under the basement couch. They are not even the same balls used at the last Summer Games. Two years ago, the international federation that governs the sport switched the material of the official ball from celluloid to a different type of plastic. The federation also allowed the ball to be slightly larger. Some players are still struggling to adjust  \u2014   and so, apparently, are some manufacturers. Many players criticized as subpar the specific quality of the balls from D. H. S. a Chinese equipment brand that became the official ball supplier after the 2012 Olympics in London. \u201cI think many players are complaining because we have better balls,\u201d said Timo Boll of Germany, who is at his fourth Olympics. \u201cThere are better balls on the market. We don\u2019t use them at international tournaments. That\u2019s a pity. \u201d The old celluloid balls were required to have a diameter of 39. 5 to 40. 5 millimeters the new ones can range from 40. 0 to 40. 6 millimeters. According to players, a bigger ball produces less speed and less spin. After the change, players had to recalibrate years of training and muscle memory. Those reliant on spin were disadvantaged more than athletic power hitters. The balls were changed shortly after the 2000 Olympics, increasing in size from 38 millimeters. Other past changes in equipment and rumors that more could be coming, like a rise in net height, have left players irked. \u201cThis is not good this is unprofessional,\u201d Panagiotis Gionis of Greece said of the tinkering. \u201cIt\u2019s your job. It affects you. Some players are destroyed about this. \u201d Gionis criticized the D. H. S. ball but was equally concerned about the lack of consistency from competition to competition. Different brands can be used in domestic leagues, regional tournaments and international competitions, and no two have felt alike in the past two years. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you have to drive a different car than yours,\u201d said Costantini, the United States coach, who was more concerned about this inconsistency than about the quality of any brand. \u201cMaybe the brakes are not the same, the accelerating, and it takes some time to adjust. \u201d Players have to begin the adjustment process for the Olympics  \u2014   the most prestigious competition in the sport  \u2014   weeks or months before the Games to get comfortable with the ball. But that was tough to do this summer, some said, because of what they perceived as the poor quality of the D. H. S. ball. \u201cWe practiced with that ball months beforehand to get used to it, but you can never get used to it,\u201d said Ovtcharov, who also said he felt the ball getting softer over the course of his games. (Certain competitions cycle multiple balls through a match, but not the Olympics.) Stefan Fegerl of Austria said: \u201cThis ball doesn\u2019t jump so well. Many times it falls down very fast. When you hit them with the edge, maybe it\u2019s broken. The quality is not good. \u201d In an interview Tuesday, Lou   the general manager of D. H. S. said he had not heard any complaints firsthand. Through an interpreter, Lou said the company was \u201cquite satisfied\u201d with its transition to the new ball. Still, he was sympathetic when informed of the concerns. He said the company was continuing research to make a better ball. \u201cFrom one side, they give us information,\u201d Lou said, \u201cand from the other side, we improve the balls gradually. \u201d Thomas Weikert, the president of the federation that governs the sport, acknowledged in an interview that the balls used in the past two years had not been as good as they could be. But he said this was a symptom of the industry rather than of any individual company. \u201cThey\u2019ve improved a lot,\u201d Weikert said of the balls. \u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s O. K. It\u2019s not 100 percent. \u201d Lou and Weikert noted that some griping was expected. \u201cIf you use another ball, other players will complain,\u201d Weikert said. To be sure, certain players seemed blissfully unaware of the complaints. Told about the multitude of players voicing frustrations with the ball, Paul Drinkhall of Britain smiled. \u201cDid they lose?\u201d he said. Boll, the German player, was eliminated in the fourth round of the singles tournament. The team competition begins Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m sure they want to produce now a better ball because they\u2019re getting a lot of criticism,\u201d Boll said. \u201cIt would have been nice if it was before the Olympic Games. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628591.2943635}
