Take Odissi (from the state of Odisha, on India\u2019s east coast) which, though one of the world\u2019s oldest dance genres, came close to extinction in the   century. Now, however, it often seems astoundingly vital: No dance idiom is more overwhelmingly sensuous. Even in a year that was remarkable for premieres and revivals in ballet and modern dance, the beauties of Odissi were, again, a revelation, in late October in New York. Thanks to Mark Morris\u2019s \u201cSounds of India,\u201d part of the White Light Festival, the   troupe Nrityagram Dance Ensemble (led by Surupa Sen and Bijayini Satpathy Ms. Sen is also the choreographer) danced at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater. (The live music was played by men.) In Odissi, a woman\u2019s hourglass figure becomes the source of glory and profundity. Shoulders and pelvis can tilt in subtle opposition to the waist, and to each other, with sculptural tensions that flood the theater. The arc of an arm, moving in alignment with neck and spine, opens up infinity. The Nrityagram program included the world premiere of the duet \u201cLalita Lavanga\u201d and the North American premiere of the solo \u201cAali. \u201d The Nrityagram artists have been visiting New York for over a decade, but the impact of their dancing still comes as the best kind of shock. So, too, does Alexei Ratmansky\u2019s \u201cSerenade After Plato\u2019s Symposium,\u201d to the Leonard Bernstein score of that name. This had its premiere with American Ballet Theater in May (at the Metropolitan Opera House) and returned in October (to the David H. Koch Theater). Mr. Ratmansky has already made the finest ballets of this century: notably \u201cConcerto DSCH,\u201d for New York City Ballet in 2008, and \u201cPictures at an Exhibition,\u201d for that company in 2014. Here he surpassed even those works. This \u201cSymposium\u201d explores several of the finest levels of civilization  \u2014   philosophical discussion about love, the beauties of a violin concerto, the human variety of classical dancing. The major revivals of 2016 cast even more light than the year\u2019s premieres. Here, too, Mr. Ratmansky led the way. The production he presented in Zurich of the 1895 Mariinsky \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d as choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, was the staging the world needs of this often coarsened central classic. (The opera house in Zurich, seating about 1, 000, stands behind Lake Zurich, on which swans swim in view of Alpine mountains: a more perfect location for this classic is hard to imagine. The house\u2019s intimate acoustics did wonders for Tchaikovsky\u2019s score.) Every act brought fresh revelations, from Petipa\u2019s Act I   ensemble waltz, lost for decades, to the amazing touches of pathos with which Odette\u2019s energies vacillated in Act IV. And no Black Swan! Odile, as always intended by the ballet\u2019s makers, wore a tutu of many colors. And in November, the illustrious Sara Mearns danced the New York premiere of Mr. Ratmansky\u2019s ballerina solo \u201cFandango\u201d (created for Wendy Whelan in 2010 at the Vail International Dance Festival, to Boccherini music). Ms. Mearns blazed her musicality electrified. If I had to choose one 2016 performance by one dancer, this would be the one.  \u2014   ALASTAIR MACAULAY The Oscar Wilde quote on Indiana Woodward\u2019s Instagram account could be about her dancing: \u201cBe yourself everyone else is already taken. \u201d Ms. Woodward, who turns 23 this month, isn\u2019t just another rising member of New York City Ballet but also a dancer with the kind of freedom of expression that causes your breath to catch in your throat. Her performances over the past year, most memorably as the winged sprite in \u201cLa Sylphide\u201d and as the female protagonist in Lauren Lovette\u2019s \u201cFor Clara,\u201d demonstrate things you just can\u2019t teach: spirit, generosity, the meeting of artistry and artlessness. A member of the corps de ballet since 2012, Ms. Woodward was born in Paris. She has a look and verve similar to those of Violette Verdy, the beloved   City Ballet principal who died this year, but Ms. Woodward is also a ballerina of her time. As the Sylph, Ms. Woodward radiated a mischievous warmth with jumps that hovered in the air. In the effervescent \u201cFor Clara,\u201d she was more herself, epitomizing strength, independence and joy. She flies through choreography with glee, as if she were running barefoot through a forest. Many blocks downtown, there was another original at work this year: Eiko, the   dance artist and subject of Danspace Project\u2019s Platform 2016: \u201cA Body in Places. \u201d For part of it, Eiko, 64, performed a series of intimate solos, in East Village locations, that braided together painstakingly slow movement and stillness with spurts of abandon. During one performance at Middle Collegiate Church on Second Avenue, a thrashing Eiko darted through the sanctuary\u2019s front doors and landed on the sidewalk. It had been raining, and like an East Village Mary Poppins, she pounced into a puddle. The combination of such vulnerability and daring as strangers  \u2014   some truly mystified  \u2014   stared had the effect of transforming her seemingly frail body into something otherworldly. Eiko and Ms. Woodward may be generations apart and practicing vastly different dance forms, but each moves as if there were no tomorrow.  \u2014   GIA KOURLAS Some dances have a way of pulling you into their present, letting you lose track of time, or giving you no other choice. In Beth Gill\u2019s \u201cCatacomb,\u201d performed at the Chocolate Factory in May, that pull was inexorable. I remember less about the details of the work itself than I do about the moment it ended  \u2014   a startling return to reality. What had just happened? Where had I gone? It was in the same small, unadorned space in Long Island City, Queens, that Ms. Gill first presented her Bessie   \u201cElectric Midwife\u201d in 2012. Like the inverse of that luminous, orderly piece, \u201cCatacomb\u201d was dark, tangled, subterranean, yet still pristine in its structure. Ms. Gill has worked for years with many of the same collaborators, and the depth of those connections showed, in the seamless meeting of Jon Moniaci\u2019s macabre score, Thomas Dunn\u2019s otherworldly lighting and the dancers\u2019 careful manipulation of tension and weight. Also playing tricks with the passage of time, calling up spirits from the past, the choreographers Ishmael   and Miguel Gutierrez brought us \u201cVariations on Themes From Lost and Found: Scenes From a Life and Other Works by John Bernd. \u201d Part of Danspace Project\u2019s essential \u201cPlatform 2016: Lost and Found,\u201d a   meditation on dance artists lost to AIDS, \u201cVariations\u201d reimagined the work of the   choreographer (and occasional composer) John Bernd, who died in 1988, at 35, of complications from the illness. Mr. Bernd\u2019s exuberant movement and harmonious songs  \u2014   along with his simple, expressive line drawings, projected over the altar of the sanctuary at St. Mark\u2019s Church  \u2014   came surging back to life through seven audacious dancers, many of whom weren\u2019t yet born when he died. Even while confronting themes of absence and loss, the evening felt like a celebration and, to those of us who didn\u2019t know Mr. Bernd, an introduction long overdue.  \u2014  SIOBHAN BURKE Before this year, I would not have suspected Lar Lubovitch of harboring radical tendencies. But for two weeks in September and October, this     choreographer purged the Joyce Theater of its sometimes stifling air of safety. And he did it generously, by creating a platform for the work of other dancemakers, a series called \u201cNY Quadrille. \u201d The platform was more than metaphorical  \u2014   a new stage with seating on multiple sides  \u2014   but the crucial change seemed less a matter of perspective than of permission: a license to take risks. RoseAnne Spradlin\u2019s \u201cX\u201d went the farthest many audience members impatient with its endurance test (and missing its humor) left early. I\u2019ve found other pieces by this bold artist more compelling, and I could say the same about the \u201cQuadrille\u201d contributions by Pam Tanowitz and Tere O\u2019Connor. (Loni Landon seemed out of place.) But all three offered highly intelligent, questioning,   choreography of a variety particular to New York. Good for the Joyce. For me, the most moving dance show of the year  \u2014   one of the most moving I\u2019ve ever seen  \u2014   was at the Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires in July. I had been looking forward to \u201cAnd Still You Must Swing,\u201d as a collaboration among Dormeshia   Derick K. Grant and Jason Samuels Smith: three of the world\u2019s greatest tap dancers. They were joined by the contemporary choreographer Camille A. Brown and a jazz trio. As a tap show, it was more than I hoped for: a return to tap\u2019s deepest and richest rhythmic roots, entirely up to date, pushing the art forward. But the week of its premiere was also the week of more killings of black men by police officers, and the show  \u2014   unintentionally but unavoidably in honest improvisation  \u2014   reflected the feelings of its dancers, all  . There was shared pain and also shared delight in one another\u2019s company and gifts. The power of dance as a channel of expression  \u2014   as a method of survival  \u2014   has seldom been clearer.  \u2014   BRIAN SEIBERT More highlights from the year, as chosen by our critics: Movies, Television, Pop Albums, Pop Songs, Classical Music, Theater, Art, Podcasts and Performances'"}, "time": 1742628444.484242}
