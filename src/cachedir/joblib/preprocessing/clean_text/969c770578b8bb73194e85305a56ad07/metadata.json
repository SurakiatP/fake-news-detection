[On Palm Sunday, twin bombings by jihadists at two Egyptian churches killed at least 45 worshippers and wounded more than 100 others in the latest of a long string of deadly attacks targeting Christians throughout the world.  The attacks were directed specifically to Christian in their houses of worship to avoid any ambiguity regarding the intent. As has been noted, this was \u201can attack on Christians simply because they are Christians. \u201d On Saturday, the Pakistan military said it has thwarted a \u201cmajor terrorist attack\u201d against Christians planned for Easter Sunday after a successful overnight raid just hours after Christians celebrated Good Friday services. On Easter Sunday 2016, an Islamist militant took the lives of more than 70 people and injured over 320 more after detonating his suicide vest in a park in Lahore that was full of Christian families celebrating the feast. Among the victims are more than 30 small children, who at the time of the blast were playing sports and outdoor games in the    Park. During the last calendar year, some 90, 000 Christians were killed for their faith across the globe, making Christians by far the most persecuted group in the world, according to a study from the   Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR). The director of CESNUR, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that whereas atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians in the last century, \u201cIslamic  \u201d has taken its place as the   agent of persecution. The Center\u2019s findings corroborate those of other scholars and human rights groups. According to the 2016 \u201cWorld Watch List,\u201d for example, published by the Open Doors organization, nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer \u201cextreme persecution\u201d had populations that are at least 50 percent Muslim. Their 2016 report revealed that \u201cIslamic extremism is by far the most significant persecution engine\u201d of Christians in the world today and that \u201c40 of the 50 countries on the World Watch List are affected by this kind of persecution. \u201d During the year, nearly   of the Christians killed for their faith were executed at the hands of Islamic extremists such as the Islamic State or Boko Haram. While tens of thousands of Christians are killed for their faith, Introvigne said, they are just the tip of the iceberg and much persecution takes place on a daily basis that never makes news. Along with the enormous number of deaths, a great many more Christians \u2014  as many as 600 million \u2014  were prevented from practicing their faith in 2016. On Easter 2015, Pope Francis reminded the world that there are more Christian martyrs in the present age than even in the first centuries, when the Roman Empire attempted to eliminate all followers of the nascent religion. Calling for \u201ctangible help in the defense and protection of our brothers and sisters who are persecuted, exiled, killed, and beheaded just for being Christians,\u201d Francis told a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peter\u2019s Square that today\u2019s martyrs \u201care more numerous than in the first centuries. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
