Trump\u2019s threat to impose a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas, the first significant confrontation over the conservative economic orthodoxy that Mr. Trump relishes trampling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into some kind of trade war,\u201d Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and majority leader, told reporters in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats over the weekend to seek a 35 percent import tariff on goods sold by United States companies that move jobs overseas and displace American workers. Speaker Paul D. Ryan also pushed back against Mr. Trump on Monday in an interview with a Wisconsin reporter, saying an overhaul of the corporate tax code would more effectively keep companies in the United States than tax penalties. \u201cI think we can get at the goal here,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is to keep American businesses American, build things in America and sell them overseas  \u2014   that can be properly addressed with comprehensive tax reform. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s economic positions clashed with traditional conservatives during the campaign, but now these differences  \u2014   on trade, government spending on infrastructure, and tax policies  \u2014   have set the incoming president on a perilous course with the lawmakers whose support he needs to keep his agenda on track. \u201cThere will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, A. C. units etc. back across the border,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a series of Twitter messages over the weekend. The response from Republican leaders underscored the limits of legislating 140 characters at a time on Twitter, and gave Democrats cause to believe they can work with Mr. Trump to outmaneuver congressional Republicans next year. \u201cThe   won in part by campaigning against the Republican establishment on many economic issues,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader. \u201cIf he wants to get something done for working families in this country, he\u2019ll have to stand up to them when it comes time to govern, too. \u201d Mr. Trump first startled Republicans during the campaign when he attacked trade deals, putting himself more in line with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont than Mr. Ryan. He repeatedly insisted that trade deals had displaced American workers and harmed the economy, upending two centuries of American economic policies that held trade up as a good thing, a position that Republicans have pushed in recent decades. His positions helped imperil President Obama\u2019s trade pact with Asian nations, the   Partnership, and abruptly stop further trade negotiations, which many experts in both parties believe limits the United States in its economic position against China, especially when paired with tariff threats. \u201cI respect   Trump for fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw from T. P. P. ,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said shortly after the election. \u201cWe can\u2019t abandon these markets to China and other competitors, because American businesses and customers will lose out,\u201d he added. Mr. Trump made Republicans bend to his will  \u2014   and against their   opposition to picking \u201cwinners and losers\u201d in the economy  \u2014   even before his inauguration when he announced last month that the     manufacturer Carrier would keep roughly 1, 000 jobs in the state rather than moving them to Mexico, thanks to $7 million in tax incentives negotiated by Vice   Mike Pence, the current governor of Indiana. This is the sort of package Republicans have traditionally loathed. The once intensely conservative Mr. Pence channeled the views of Mr. Sanders when he explained the Carrier deal by saying, \u201cThe free market has been sorting it out, and America\u2019s been losing. \u201d Mr. Ryan and many other fiscal conservatives appeared to agree. \u201cEveryone here knows what it means to lose jobs in their districts,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cIf Trump can keep a thousand families from going through such an ordeal, then good for him. And if it makes other companies think twice about the human consequences of their business decisions, so much the better. \u201d But big tariffs appear too much to abide. Both Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, supported a bill that gave Mr. Obama and his successor special \u201cfast track\u201d authority to negotiate trade agreements, and are proponents of reducing tariff barriers. \u201cTax cuts and deregulation will make the American economy great again, but tariffs and trade wars will make it tank again,\u201d David McIntosh, president of the conservative group Club for Growth, said in a statement, adding, \u201cThe majority leader is right to caution against protectionism and to urge a robust debate on free markets and trade. \u201d House leaders want to tackle the problem of companies\u2019 moving operations overseas with a broad rewriting of the corporate tax code, which they say will make American manufacturing more competitive without resorting to punitive measures on individual companies. \u201cTough talk plays well with his base and is arguably even long overdue,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant and former official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cBut ultimately, the legislative focus will be on tax reform and deregulation versus tariffs and trade wars. I don\u2019t believe Republicans will let a golden opportunity to finally pass comprehensive tax reform fall victim to intraparty squabbling. \u201d Republicans also fought mightily this week to remove a provision from a water bill favored by Democrats  \u2014   and aligned with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises  \u2014   that would require the use of   iron and steel for domestic water infrastructure projects. They said they feared the measure would direct federal funding to some domestic companies but not others. Mr. Trump has long been a proponent of propping up the American steel industry, even though he has used imported steel for some of his building projects. Next on the horizon could be a Medicare fight. Mr. Trump said during his campaign that threats to change the program caused his party to lose its bid for the White House in 2012,   Mr. Ryan in his swipe. Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan are in   mode at present, but how much that holds up remains to be seen. Mr. Ryan has a proposal to transform the Medicaid program into a block grant and change the Medicare program so that Americans now under 55 would get a specified amount of money from the federal government toward the premium for private health coverage. Mr. Trump has been inconsistent on the Medicare issue, and his choice for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, shares Mr. Ryan\u2019s views.'"}, "time": 1742628534.032751}
