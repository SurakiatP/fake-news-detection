I. could potentially be dangerous to the human race, who he described as already   should it overtake us in intelligence. [\u201cOne of the most troubling questions is artificial intelligence. I don\u2019t mean narrow A. I   \u2014   deep artificial intelligence, where you can have AI which is much smarter than the smartest human on earth,\u201d proclaimed Musk during the World Government Summit in Dubai. \u201cThis is a dangerous situation. \u201d  \u201cPay close attention to the development of artificial intelligence,\u201d he continued. \u201cMake sure researchers don\u2019t get carried away. Scientists get so engrossed in their work they don\u2019t realize what they are doing. \u201d Musk continued to claim that humans are already   citing the range of digital applications that people now depend on every day. \u201cTo some degree we are already a cyborg  \u2014   you think of all the digital tools that you have  \u2014   your phone, your computer,\u201d claimed Musk. \u201cThe applications that you have. The fact that you can ask a question and instantly get an answer from Google and other things. \u201d \u201cYou already have a digital tertiary layer. Think of the limbic system  \u2014   the animal brain and the cortex as the thinking part of the brain, and your digital self as a third layer,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you die your digital ghost is still around. All of their emails, and social media, that still lives if they die. \u201d \u201cOver time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence  \u2026     It\u2019s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output,\u201d Musk concluded. \u201cSome high bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem. \u201d In November, Musk predicted that automated robots would lead to mass unemployment, which could eventually create a universal wage from the government. In June, the billionaire tech entrepreneur claimed it likely that mankind is living in a   computer simulation. Musk was also one of the Silicon Valley billionaires, along with fellow PayPal Mafia members Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, who invested $1 billion into an artificial intelligence center in 2015. On Monday, Business Insider reported that Google\u2019s new A. I. had learned to become \u201chighly aggressive\u201d in stressful situations, turning on each other in a virtual game once resources became scarce. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
