The asteroid missed by a distance of only 310,000 miles, around 1.3 times further away than the Moon. That\u2019s incredibly close in space terms. \\n2016 UR36 could be up to 82 feet across, roughly comparable in size to the meteor that exploded over Russia in February 2013, causing hundreds of injuries . \\nIf 2016 UR36 had slammed into Earth, it would have struck with a force 55 times stronger than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima near the end of World War II. That\u2019s more than enough force to level a city. \\nNASA director Charles Bolden told reporters in 2013 that the only response to a such a late detection of an asteroid set to collide with Earth was to \u201c Pray .\u201d \\nGlobal asteroid detection programs found more than 15,176 near-Earth objects of all sizes with 1,562 new near-Earth objects being identified this year alone, according to International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planets Center . These newly discovered near-Earth objects are part of a much larger population of more than 700,000 known asteroids in our Solar System. \\nNASA and its European partners are now focused on finding objects that are 450 feet in diameter or larger, which could devastate a city or country if they struck Earth. \\nIn the event an asteroid couldn\u2019t be prevented from hitting Earth, the Planetary Defense Coordination Office would work with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies to coordinate disaster response.'"}, "time": 1742564569.7119043}
