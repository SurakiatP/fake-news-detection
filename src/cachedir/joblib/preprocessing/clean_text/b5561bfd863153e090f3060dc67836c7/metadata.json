[Kassam commiserated with Jasser about the difficulties of being a Muslim reformer in a media environment where stern criticism of Islam, even from Muslims, is treated like racism.  Jasser said apologists for Islam\u2019s excesses were \u201cbasically doing takfir on national television,\u201d using the Muslim term for disinformation. \u201cMy response is, I\u2019m proud not to be part of their Islamist community, but these guys talk about Muslims like we\u2019re a gang,\u201d he said. \u201cLike they own the gang, and we can\u2019t participate, when in fact they want to shut down free speech, they want to deny that we\u2019re a diverse community. \u201d \u201cWhen people say \u2018why do these radical attacks keep happening?\u2019 it\u2019s because the free world refuses to treat Muslims like adults,\u201d said Jasser. \u201cThey want to coddle the Muslim community, use them for partisan purposes and identity politics, and ignore all of the signs and precursors of radicalization  \u2014   which are, by the way, the signs are hallmarks of the principles of our free society. \u201d  \u201cEquality of men and women, respect for free speech, a denial of conspiracy theories, ownership of who we are  \u2014   all of these principles, which are basic principles of human rights, in order to coddle Muslims they allow the Islamic supremacists, the sharia supremacists to speak for our community,\u201d he elaborated.  \u201cMeanwhile, they are basically telling Muslims like myself who love America, who want to stand up for our country, \u2018Oh, go sit at the back of the bus. You don\u2019t deserve any recognition. We\u2019re going to let the men with the long beards and the apologists basically speak for your community.\u2019 It\u2019s bigoted. It is them who are the bigots. We are being told we don\u2019t love our faith, when in fact it\u2019s the tough love of Muslims like myself that really, I believe, should be honored in a free society,\u201d said Jasser. Kassam asked if the wave of terrorist attacks was a direct result of allowing Islamists and their apologists to \u201cdominate the conversation\u201d at the expense of reformists like Jasser, sometimes equating reformist criticism with apostasy. \u201cIt definitely is,\u201d Jasser replied. \u201cISIS, the Islamic State, is not only ISIS. Every one of the Islamic states of the 56   countries that form the Organization of Islamic Cooperation is based on a sharia state platform. That sharia state basically says that you need to follow the laws as determined by the clerics who define what is and is not Islam, what is and is not permitted speech. If you don\u2019t fit in that construct, then you are not a Muslim. Therefore, how do you control that state? You control it by limited free speech and rejecting those who fall outside the confines of their theocracy. \u201d \u201cPeople need to understand, political Islam\u2019s goal is not to dominate   countries, but to evangelize, spread their ideas globally and defeat secular states, defeat   states,\u201d he warned. \u201cThey divide the world into the land of Islam and the land of War. \u201d \u201cWe in the West, by virtue of not evangelizing liberty, being offensive in pushing back  \u2014   not only against terror, which is a symptom, but against the theocratic ideology of political Islam  \u2014   are being sheepish. Appeasing, if you will. By not pushing for our ideas of universal human rights, we have been basically unarmed, and we\u2019re starting to see a sonic boom of the lack of assimilation,\u201d he said.  \u201cThose within our society that are Islamists reject who we are. When Britain looks and says wow, there\u2019s almost more jihadis from Britain going to Syria than there are Muslims loving Britain and serving in their own military  \u2014   just look at the numbers. It should be 99 percent for one, serving in the British military, versus going to jihad. It is almost 50 to 50. That is why we\u2019re losing this war,\u201d said Jasser. Kassam asked how adherents of a Westernized Muslim could reconcile themselves to the portions of Koranic doctrine that conflict with Western ideals, such as freedom of speech. \u201cThat\u2019s a great question, especially now in this month of Ramadan where we fast and reflect, and seek atonement and humility,\u201d Jasser replied. \u201cThe Islam that I believe in and teach my kids is a personal faith. It\u2019s not up to the government. It\u2019s not up to the imam who is the teacher. I can talk to five, six imams and then make up my seventh decision, some different decision. \u201d \u201cRemember, what people read as the Koran is interpretation. The only thing that is Koran is the Arabic. The battle over interpretation is, what are the original words in Arabic? How do we actually define them? Many of them are fake and intentionally misleading interpretations,\u201d he argued.  \u201cThe others that are about wars and battles, we need to separate and say, \u2018You know what? Maybe it made sense in 620, 625 C. E. but we need to circumscribe those and say we no longer apply to today.\u2019 You have to separate the historical part of the passages from applies to today,\u201d he advised. \u201cMuslims have done that with the rejection of polygamy that\u2019s permitted, with the rejection of the cutting of hands for stealing, things like that. There\u2019s a way to separate those things, and other ways to reinterpret. \u201d As a much more delicate example, Jasser noted there is a passage in the Koran about the permissibility of beating women, but he suggested it could be reinterpreted in a modern context as \u201cgoing on strike\u201d (i. e. separating from her) instead of physically \u201cstriking\u201d her. \u201cThere are modern ways to reinterpret the exact same words in a     more modern liberal way while staying true to the authenticity of the script,\u201d he stressed, referring to two schools of Islam that reject modernization and insist on highly literal interpretations of the Koran.
