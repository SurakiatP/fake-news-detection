But it can also be seen in a battle that has broken out about the fundamental nature of this distinctively   and   city. The conflict has pitted developers and some government officials against neighborhood organizations and preservationists. It is a debate about height and neighborhood character the influence of   developers on City Hall and, most of all, what Los Angeles should look like a generation from now. This is a city that has long defied easy definition  \u2014   at once urban, suburban and even rural  \u2014   filled with people who live in homes with   gardens and open skies dotted by swaying palm trees, often blocks away from gritty boulevards, highways and clusters of office buildings. And it is no stranger to battles between entrenched neighborhood groups and   developers seeing opportunity in a wealthy market the   movement thrived here during the 1990s. But the debate this time has reached a particularly pitched level, fueled by a severe shortage of affordable housing, an influx of people moving back into the city center and the perception that a Southern California city that once seemed to have unlimited space for growth has run out of track. \u201cWhat\u2019s that old clich\u00e9?\u201d Mayor Eric M. Garcetti said in an interview. \u201cThe sprawl has hit the wall in L. A. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not whether or not density is going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether we plan for it or not. People are like, \u2018Oh my God, this is L. A. and they are going tall?\u2019 Height makes you think it\u2019s more dense. And it doesn\u2019t always compute that way. You have to convince people. \u201d The resistance has been sharp, reflecting a widespread notion that much of the development has been disruptive and haphazard, as well as strong sentimental attachment to a city filled with handsome   neighborhoods and classic old homes. \u201cStop Manhattanwood\u201d billboards have popped up in Hollywood, close to where two   towers were approved by city officials  \u2014   after a long battle by neighborhood groups  \u2014   next to the Hollywood Palladium concert hall. In Beverly Hills, which is a separate city from Los Angeles, a proposal by the Beverly Hilton to build what would be that city\u2019s tallest building, a   hotel, has drawn opposition from the mayor in a   battle that will be decided in a ballot measure this fall. In Los Angeles, neighborhood groups, including opponents of the Palladium project, are collecting signatures for a voter initiative that would impose a   moratorium on    projects that require special city zoning variations. \u201cYou have huge buildings going on tiny little streets,\u201d said Jill Stewart, who is directing the ballot initiative campaign. \u201cAreas that cannot absorb the development. And communities that haven\u2019t had the discussion about whether they want these buildings. \u201d The initiative needs 67, 000 signatures to be placed on the ballot. It already has 104, 000 signatures among its more prominent supporters is Richard J. Riordan, a Republican and a former mayor of Los Angeles. \u201cOur city is rapidly being gentrified,\u201d Mr. Riordan said. \u201cThe working poor  \u2014   the lower middle class  \u2014   are being pushed out of L. A. They are giving building permits to the developers, the ones that give money to the politicians, to build   buildings. \u201d Mitch O\u2019Farrell, a member of the Los Angeles City Council, called the ballot initiative an overreaction, saying the city needed to encourage growth and development. \u201cPeople have real concerns about how projects will affect their neighborhoods, which are legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are a lot of additional factors in the equation: the opportunities to bring economic growth, to create projects that improve the look of a community, that enhance the safety and security of a community and that also help provide needed tax dollars. \u201d A number of factors have contributed to the tensions. Los Angeles, like many other big cities dealing with traffic, has been encouraging development along   lines, such as the one that cuts through Hollywood. The city has also been roiled by a wave of developer   of picturesque homes in   neighborhoods, making way for big houses and stirring sharp opposition in many places. \u201cLos Angeles was built as a suburban city  \u2014   it was always put forth as a suburban city,\u201d said Jonathan M. Zasloff, a law professor at U. C. L. A. who teaches land use and opposes the ballot initiative. \u201cYou could be in the city and still be in the country at the same time. So when you got a situation where it\u2019s now a city that looks very different, the people who like the old way are trying to stop it from changing. \u201cChange is scary  \u2014   urbanization is scary,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust the city. This is a way to stop it. But Los Angeles is not an example of a city where development has run riot. It just isn\u2019t. \u201d There is a long history here of historically distinctive buildings\u2019 being torn down to make way for new construction, setting off battles with preservationists. Many of the 88 cities in Los Angeles County have historical preservation ordinances, but their effectiveness varies, and much of the construction is proposed for open lots and strip malls. \u201cThe history of Los Angeles is in large part a history of ambivalence about dense development and especially about tall buildings,\u201d Christopher Hawthorne, the architecture critic for The Los Angeles Times, wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to rank as a cosmopolitan,   city. At the same time, for more than a century we\u2019ve had   committees, ballot measures and civic debates about height limits for new buildings. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving the newest wave of construction and its backlash, more than anything, is geography: We\u2019ve run out of open space to build and at the same time hit the limits of sprawl,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLos Angeles is doubling back on itself, building in its midsection as opposed to gobbling up new territory along its periphery. We have finally realized that there are real benefits  \u2014   in terms of water use, for example  \u2014   to be gained by living more densely and more vertically. \u201d Los Angeles has also not rewritten its master plan, which regulates what should be built where, in nearly 30 years. That has led city officials to approve many projects case by case, fueling   suspicions that council members are bending to the will of powerful developers. Richard Platkin, a planner who used to work for the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, said the   spot zoning decisions meant that \u201cyou have very politically powerful institutions, and occasionally someone with deep pockets, who spends a lot of money to change the zone for one individual parcel. \u201d \u201cThe skyline gets ragged instead of harmonious,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s out of character and out of scale. \u201d Mr. Zasloff said growth was critical for the future of Los Angeles. \u201cWhen you have the average renter paying nearly half of his income in rent, that is just unsustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable for a city that wants to be a healthy city. You can\u2019t have a healthy city without a healthy middle class. And they have to have a place where you can afford to live. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628436.0471847}
