Rainfall changes \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nThe report says these changes in rainfall mean \u201cthat the capacity to face shortages or excesses of water will be fundamental in the efforts to improve productivity in a sustainable way\u201d. \\nA separate study carried out earlier by the FAO, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and the Latin American Integration Associatio n (ALADI) shows that agriculture accounts for 23% of regional exports, employs 16% of the economically active population, and contributes 5% to regional GDP. \\nThe SOFA 2016 report predicts that climate change will bring more drought and increases in temperature that will reduce productivity in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It foresees more salinisation and desertification in the arid areas of Chile and Brazil, while along the Pacific coastline some fish species will move further south. \u201cThe capacity to face shortages or excesses of water will be fundamental in the efforts to improve productivity in a sustainable way\u201d \\nIn the Caribbean, the greater frequency of storms, tornadoes and cyclones will harm aquaculture (the farming of aquatic organisms such as crustaceans, molluscs, and aquatic plants) and fisheries, and temperature changes could alter the physiology of freshwater fish species and cause the sinking of coral reef systems. \\nForested areas could be transformed into savannas, while Amazonia will face the risk of frequent fires. In Central America, climate change could lead to 40% of mangrove species being at risk of extinction. \\nThe report notes that although governments in the region see a reduction in deforestation as the main method of combating climate change, forests continue to be converted for farming and cattle breeding, which are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the region. Causes of emissions \\nThese emissions have three main causes. In 2014, they were: enteric fermentation\u2014the product of the digestive systems of ruminants (58%); manure deposited in areas of pasture (23%); and artificial fertilisers (6%). \\nThe FAO warns that climate change would affect food production, reducing not only the amount available but the variety of foodstuffs. Extreme events in areas of large-scale production will have severe implications for trade, affecting the international supply of food. \\nThe report concludes that the climate changes it foresees would affect food and nutritional security in the region, causing abrupt variations in the incomes of families who depend on agriculture, or, where there is a fall in demand for paid rural labour, a reduction in their capacity to buy food. \\nThe effects could also include big changes to the diet of the population, with a fall in food variety and in healthy foods, leading to poorer nutrition. \\nAll in all, the FAO report offers a fairly bleak perspective if countries continue on their present path of sleepwalking into the future, with many governments unaware of or unwilling to face up to the challenges of climate change. \\nJan Rocha is a freelance journalist living in Brazil and is a former correspondent there for the BBC World Service and The Guardian.
