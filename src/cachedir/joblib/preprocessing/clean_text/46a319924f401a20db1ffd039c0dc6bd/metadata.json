Every Friday for the last year, we\u2019ve run one of those lists on TMagazine. com. So many books have been recommended  \u2014   by everyone from James Franco to Alice Waters  \u2014   that it might feel like you need a lifetime (and then another one) to read them all. So, in honor of the July 4th weekend, we\u2019re giving you that time to catch up  \u2014   or at least pick a good book to bring along to the beach. Here, excerpts from 10 of the individuals who have recommended titles over the last several months. Click the link beneath each name to read their whole list. Enjoy! \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature,\u201d Steven Pinker Proof that the world is becoming more peaceful. It\u2019s not just a question for historians, but a profound statement about human nature and the possibility for a better future. This book may have shaped my outlook more than any other.

See more of Gloria Steinem\u2019s favorite books.  \u201cYou\u2019ve Got To Read This: Contemporary American Writers Introduce Stories That Held Them in Awe,\u201d Ron Hansen This anthology is like one of those fateful   nights where you met a boyfriend, a best friend and got a lead on a job. It introduced me to Jim Shepard and Donald Barthelme. I often think of Amy Tan\u2019s introduction of Molly Giles\u2019s story, \u201cPie Dance. \u201d Tan writes that upon hearing Giles read the story, she felt she didn\u2019t yet have what it took to be a writer but she \u201calso knew  \u2014   as deeply as you can know something about yourself  \u2014   that it would be worth a lifetime to try. \u201d That\u2019s one of the most genuine things I\u2019ve ever heard a writer say about another writer.

You need a front porch, you need a busy street, you need neighbors to say hello and good night to and you need a bedroom to restore yourself. This is a book you can open on any page. You might find a drawing of the narrow streets of Ethiopia, or a chapter titled \u201cDancing in the Streets,\u201d which is something people have done forever.

An exhilarating prelude to the great novels of his famous late phase. See more of Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s favorite books.  \u201cThe Fire Next Time,\u201d James Baldwin Basically the finest essay I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s technically two essays but it feels like one. Baldwin refused to hold anyone\u2019s hand. He was both direct and beautiful all at once. He did not seem to write to convince you. He wrote beyond you. See more of   Coates\u2019s favorite books.  \u201cWomen,\u201d Chloe Caldwell Sexy, sexy   hybrid that could turn anyone into a lesbian, at least for a summer. See more of Lena Dunham\u2019s favorite books. \u201cBirds of America,\u201d Lorrie Moore Long before I started to write in earnest, Lorrie Moore taught me you could have a woman narrator who was funny and complex and even wrongheaded. She opened up a lot of space that me and a million other women rushed into.

It\u2019s too easy to just go with the obvious choice( s). But this is his most daring novel, and the labyrinthine twists and turns of each sentence demands undivided attention  \u2014   so perfect for a desert island, then.

It would be so cool to hear his stories and sit back and talk about jazz. Miles moved to New York around the same age as I did, and he was a transformative player in the evolution of jazz music as we know it. This autobiography was his chance to tell all.
