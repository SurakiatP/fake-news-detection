Hopefully this will be enough to swing it in Florida\u201d. \\nMr. Trump previously threatened to build a wall on the border of Mexico if elected \u2013 one of the main cornerstones of his campaign \u2013 but this later backfired due to the fact that America is a pluralistic society and 59% of all unauthorized immigrants in the US hold residence in the 6 key voting states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. \\n\u201cHe really shot himself in the foot with that one,\u201d Mook added, \u201cHe should have been nice to the illegals, like we\u2019ve been, and then deal with them later if that\u2019s what keeps us popular. Which we\u2019ll probably do, once we\u2019ve got what we wanted from them\u201d. \\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s decision to begin building walls around polling stations has been criticised by election experts, who have said he should have begun construction months ago. \\n\u201cIt was build walls around polling stations months ago or stop being such a racist dick, but obviously only one of these things was possible,\u201d an election expert explained.'"}, "time": 1742628380.3542244}
