It prohibits the use of any foreign law in the state\u2019s courts, specifically in family cases that involve marriage or   relationship matters. [One of the bill\u2019s   Representative Jeff Leach ( ) thanked the governor, who signed HB 45 on Wednesday. Leach called the law \u201cvitally important bill to further safeguard and protect our Constitutional rights!\u201d In the last legislative session, Leach authored the comparable yet unsuccessful ALAC measure, House Bill 562.   HB 45 lead author Representative Dan Flynn ( ) also introduced similar past legislation that failed. In a recent press release, Flynn noted foreign law is often applied in Texas cases concerning divorce orders, child support, property settlements and sometime even, spouses enter into agreements to have foreign law applied to their disputes. \u201cMy colleagues and I here at the Texas Legislature want to make sure Texas judges never apply foreign law in Texas courts in violation of constitutional rights and the public policy of our state,\u201d said Flynn. Under HB 45, Texas and U. S. law supersede all other laws. It prevents state judges from applying any foreign law because, in doing so, it infringes upon U. S. and Texas constitutional rights. The bill shields litigants in family law cases \u201cagainst violations of constitutional rights and public policy in the application of foreign law\u201d under the U. S. and Texas Constitutions, federal and judicial precedent, the Texas Family Code, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, among other protections. HB 45 makes no mention of any particular foreign nation, religion, or cultural practice but clarifies that \u201cforeign law\u201d means a rule, law, or code from a jurisdiction outside of the United States and it shall not override U. S and Texas law or their respective constitutions. It specifies that a \u201cforeign judgment\u201d means a ruling from a court, tribunal, or administrative adjudicator outside U. S. states and territories. The bill underscores that, in the event of any legal conflicts, \u201cfederal or state law prevails. \u201d In January 2015, Breitbart Texas confirmed in a report that an Islamic tribunal using Sharia law operated in Dallas. Dr. Taher   one of four attorneys who called themselves \u201cjudges\u201d and not arbitrators, claimed the tribunal and its decisions were \u201cvoluntary. \u201d   said the tribunal operated under Sharia as a form of \u201c  dispute resolution\u201d in civil disputes in family and business cases but also admitted that when in conflict between Sharia and Texas law, \u201cwe follow Sharia law. \u201d In December 2015, Flynn asked Attorney General Ken Paxton \u201cthe extent to which current law authorizes or requires a judge of a state court to apply foreign law in certain family law disputes. \u201d Last year, Paxton ruled in a   nonbinding legal opinion: \u201cUnder Texas law, a court is not required in family law disputes to enforce a foreign law if enforcement would be contrary to Texas public policy or if it would violate a party\u2019s basic right to due process. \u201d However, according to the Attorney General\u2019s office, Paxton\u2019s opinion only constituted a written interpretation of existing law and did not decide any law. The Texas chapter of the Council for   Relations (CAIR) called HB 45   law and lobbied for the state\u2019s Muslim community to oppose the bill. \u201cWe believe it prevents Muslims from practicing their faith in areas such as Islamic marriage, divorce, funeral procedures, and civil agreements, they said in a press release. HB 45 requires the Texas Supreme Court adopt its rules by January 1, 2018. The law goes into effect on September 1, making Texas the 12th state to enact ALAC. The other states are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Washington, according to ACT for America.
