[Helen Reynolds was in her apartment in Parkesburg, Pennsylvania Feb. 17 when a man dressed as an apartment complex worker forced his way inside her home and bound her mouth and hands with duct tape, the Daily Mail reported.  \u201cHe wrapped it all around my face and my nose and my eye glasses. He had a piece in my mouth,\u201d Reynolds told WPVI. She said he took $40 from her purse and was about to rape her when she struck up a conversation with the man. Despite having duct tape in her mouth, she was able to talk the man out of raping her. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Well it\u2019s like this,\u2019\u201d Reynolds recalled. \u201c\u2018You might as well know the truth.\u2019 I said, \u2018I have HIV and my husband died from it,\u2019 which is a lie. \u201d She said as soon as she told him that he walked out of the bedroom. \u201cThat\u2019s the comment that saved my life,\u201d she said. No suspects have been found yet in connection with the attack on Reynolds. Authorities say there have been a string of home invasions in Chester County, including a one that left a    woman assaulted, tied up, and locked in a closet for four days. Police arrested a    who had escaped from a nearby behavioral facility in that case. When WPVI asked Reynolds if she had anything to say to her attacker who\u2019s still on the loose, she said she had \u201cnothing good to say about him. \u201d \u201cI have nothing good to say about him. Nothing at all. Put him in jail, and leave the sucker there,\u201d Reynolds said.'"}, "time": 1742562411.125943}
