I\u2019m really glad now because I instantly hit it off with the hand.\u201d \\n\u201cI\u2019ve not connected with anything like that since the time I took acid while I was camping in the Lake District and met a goat named Boris in the forest,\u201d continued Mr Webber. \u201cSometimes I feel like I\u2019ve got more in common with things than people, it\u2019s like I can\u2019t have a good conversation with something unless they\u2019re not able to answer me back.\u201d \\n\u201cMe and the hand talked about all kinds of stuff,\u201d revealed a reminiscent Mr Webber. \u201cBrexit, the U.S. elections, diseases that have been eradicated, the potential dangers of genetically modifying food, chemtrail and all sorts of other really interesting things. She\u2019s a great listener, I didn\u2019t get her number but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see her around. Hopefully we can hang out again, I don\u2019t want to be getting ahead of myself but I think she could be the one.\u201d \\nAccording to Stacey Poole, the owner of the hand, she had her Saturday night ruined by \u201csome little creature\u201d who was following her around the club all night. \\n\u201cI was just trying to have a good night but that little cretin wouldn\u2019t leave me alone,\u201d complained Stacey. \u201cHe tried to talk to me but he was off his nut so I gave him the old \u2018talk to the hand\u2019 line and put my hand in his face. The daft twat took it literally and started talking to my hand, at first it was kind of funny but I couldn\u2019t get rid of him, he was following me everywhere, eventually I just had to leave. He ruined my night.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742563422.0143182}
