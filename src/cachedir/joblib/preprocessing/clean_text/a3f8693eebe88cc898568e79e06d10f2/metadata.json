[\u201cWe have a readmission deal. I\u2019m telling you Europe, do you have that courage? If you want, we\u2019ll send the 15, 000 refugees to you that we don\u2019t send each month and blow your mind,\u201d said S\u00fcleyman Soylu on Thursday evening.  \u201cYou have to keep in mind that you can\u2019t design a game in this region in spite of Turkey,\u201d Mr. Soylu added, according to a translation by Hurriyet Daily News. The \u201cdeal\u201d referred to by Mr. Soylu was struck almost exactly a year ago with the EU. Turkey promised to stem the flow of Middle Eastern migrants entering Europe in exchange for billions in aid and accelerated   travel for its citizens in the bloc. The \u201cgames\u201d he claims are being played are attempts by European leaders to stop Turkish ministers leading rallies in support of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan expanding his power in an    referendum. Millions of people living in Europe with dual Turkish citizenship are eligible to vote, and Mr. Erdo\u011fan is keen to rally their support. However, some German districts stopped rallies going ahead, and the Netherlands imposed a blanket ban and even blocked a Turkish minister\u2019s plane from landing to stop him attending. Mr. Erdo\u011fan accused the Dutch of acting like \u201cNazis\u201d in response. \u201cWho are the main ones trying to get things done? Germany and the Netherlands. Are the elections going to be held in Germany? Will the charter change in Germany or the Netherlands?\u201d Mr. Soylu said. Continuing: \u201cThis is our internal issue. What do you care? Why are you getting involved in it? Did you accept Turkey into the European Union? Did you provide support to Turkey in its fight against terrorism?\u201d \u201cThere are games being played against Turkey in order to prevent it from becoming strong in the future,\u201d he added. Mr. Erdo\u011fan and his government have been threatening to \u201cflood\u201d Europe with migrants long before the deal with the EU was even signed. On 11 January last year, Mr. Erdo\u011fan promised to \u201copen the gates\u201d to hundreds of thousands of migrants who could be transported into Europe by \u201cbus\u201d and even \u201cplane\u201d unless his demands were met in the lead up to the negotiations.'"}, "time": 1742563986.372417}
