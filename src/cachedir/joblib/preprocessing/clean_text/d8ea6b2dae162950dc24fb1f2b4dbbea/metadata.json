(AP Photo/Denis Poroy) \\nOakland, CA \u2014 After earning both soaring praise and burning ire for sitting out the national anthem, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has turned his protest against police brutality into a positive force for change \u2014 by opening an education-based camp to empower kids. \\nKaepernick, in other words, wants to teach young people how to be the change \u2014 to educate themselves and stay healthy and safe. \\nOn Saturday, Kaepernick hosted a free youth camp called Know Your Rights \u2014 a \u201cfree campaign for youth to raise awareness on higher education, self empowerment, and instruction to properly interact with law enforcement in various scenarios,\u201d the website explains. \\nHundreds of black and Latino children attended the camp, which took place in Oakland, according to the New York Daily News , and the quarterback now plans to expand the program beyond the Bay area. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. We\u2019re here to give you tools to help you succeed,\u201d Kaepernick told attendees, the Daily News reported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in America were based on, and we\u2019re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.\u201d \\nWith relations between police departments and civilians more tense than ever \u2014 and an epidemic of police brutality still growing \u2014 the camp aims to instill knowledge-based confidence in kids who might otherwise distrust uniformed officers, who often aren\u2019t members of the communities they patrol. \\nAccording to the Know Your Rights Camp site, the program\u2019s goal is to \u201chelp build a stronger generation of people that will create the change that is much needed in this world.\u201d \\nControversy raged over Kaepernick\u2019s bold choice not to stand during the national anthem, as many misunderstood his quiet police brutality protest as a publicity stunt \u2014 but details about his plans for the camp evidence quite the contrary. \\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say anything about it online,\u201d Kaepernick told Daily News reporter Shaun King a few days before Know Your Rights opened. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for the press and I don\u2019t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.\u201d \\nModeled after the original Black Panthers\u2019 10-point plan, the camp taught kids they have the fundamental rights to be free, safe, educated, courageous, loved, and more. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me because I see a lot of hope, I see a lot of what is to come,\u201d Kaepernick told The Undefeated . \u201cAnd if you look at a lot of movements in past history, it started at a youth level and has built. And that\u2019s really where change is created, is when youth come up and they\u2019re built in that culture of, \u2018I know what this means, I know why this is happening and I also know how to help create change now.\u2019\u201d \\nAccording to The Undefeated , kids from all over the San Francisco Bay area attended the camp \u2014 including a number of homeless children living in a halfway house \u2014 and heard speakers discuss organic nutrition, holistic healing, financial knowledge, higher education, the history of policing, and more. \\nNot a single workshop discussed sports. \\nKaepernick also told the youth how he\u2019d recently traced his roots to Ghana and Nigeria \u2014 provided kits to trace their ancestry, free of charge. \\nFurther, the athlete didn\u2019t stop with organizing and funding the camp \u2014 and making a simple cameo appearance \u2014 he interacted with as many of the attendees as he could, visiting the smaller breakout focus sessions as the day progressed. \\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here today in Oakland, we want to do all over the country, in cities all over this country,\u201d Kaepernick told the Daily News , \u201cby bringing together local leaders, local activists and local youth, and not only giving them the skills and lessons they need, but we want to show them how much we love and value them.\u201d \\nAnd as Kaepernick told The Undefeated on goals for expanding the camp across the country, \u201cThis might not be something where I personally can create the change that this system needs. But together we can build this and help organize and create the change that we need.\u201d \\nThis article is free and open source originally appearing on The Free Thought Project.
