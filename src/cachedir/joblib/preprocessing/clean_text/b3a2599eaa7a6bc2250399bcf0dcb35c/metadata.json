They are very different than me, and frankly very different from most of you. No matter what background you come from, you shouldn\u2019t look down on the working class, because they are what America is really about. \u201d \u201cThe difference between conservatives and the new breed of Democrats is that we don\u2019t think the working class is evil, or that they need to be controlled and taught how to think,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey care about the same things as we do. A strong America, a great economy, jobs for them AND you all when you graduate, and a safe place to live. \u201d \u201cThe American dream is what fuels the working class. The dream to improve economically and give their children a better life than they had,\u201d MILO concluded. \u201cAt some point in the recent past, liberals decided that dreamers are illegal immigrants who should get cheap college tuition instead of hard working Americans who deserve more than shuttered factories. To those Americans, I say welcome to the party of Trump, it\u2019s going to be a wild ride. \u201d Written from prepared remarks. MILO wears glasses by Givenchy, $350. Distressed blue jeans by True Religion, $329. Brown leather belt with gold buckle by Louis Vuitton, $450. Light pink dress shirt by Brooks Brothers, $92. Sparkly purple suit jacket by Angelino, $225.
