N. officials suspended all humanitarian convoys in Syria, a day after a deadly aerial attack on a convoy of 31 aid trucks authorized to travel in the   country. \u201cJust when we think it cannot get any worse, the bar of depravity sinks lower,\u201d the United Nations secretary general, Ban   said at the opening of the General Assembly in New York. Syria, Russia and the United States denied responsibility, but the U. S. officials said Russia may have carried out the attack. _____ 2. New details emerged about Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey, including that he was turned in as a terrorist to the F. B. I. two years ago  \u2014   by his father, an Afghan immigrant, above. But officials said that the father had recanted, and that agents did not interview Mr. Rahami himself, who was in jail, accused of stabbing his brother. Friends said Mr. Rahami seemed to change after traveling abroad. He went to Pakistan several times, staying for nearly a year in Quetta, the headquarters of exiled Afghan Taliban leaders as well as generations of Afghans who fled the violence in their country. The woman he married there has been detained. Our reporter retraced his likely path from the train station in Elizabeth, N. J. to the doorway of a bar where he was found sleeping on Monday morning. _____ 3. The bombings came at a critical point for the presidential campaign, pushing national security to the forefront with the first presidential debate a week away and Election Day in just seven weeks. But it\u2019s likely that neither Hillary Clinton\u2019s counterterrorism plan nor Donald Trump\u2019s would have prevented the attacks, and neither addresses the most common trajectory of radicalization in the U. S.: personal demons that morph into ideologically driven violence. At a time when polls are being intensely scrutinized, our statistical expert examines how different pollsters starting with the same data can make very different conclusions. _____ 4. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign once again drew derision from critics, this time for Donald Trump Jr. \u2019s comparison of Syrian refugees to a bowl of skittles with a scattering of poisoned candies. And Samantha Bee clobbered NBC and her fellow   TV host Jimmy Fallon for a friendly interview with Mr. Trump. \u201cNetwork execs, and a lot of their audience, can ignore how very dangerous Trump is because to them, he isn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Bee said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be deported. \u201d _____ 5. President Obama, making his final address to the U. N. Nations General Assembly, said that globalization needed to make a \u201ccourse correction. \u201d \u201cA world in which 1 percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable,\u201d he said. He also cautioned against insularity, saying, \u201cToday, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself. \u201d Here is our full coverage of the General Assembly. _____ 6. Our book reviewer got an advance copy of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s memoir, \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d which he compares to one of Mr. Springsteen\u2019s shows: \u201clong, ecstatic, exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys\u201d and \u201cpart s\u00e9ance and part keg party. \u201d And there\u2019s even news: The singer has suffered depressions so deep that he\u2019s turned to the powerful   drug Klonopin. _____ 7. Senator Elizabeth Warren led a bipartisan chorus of censure against John Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, for protecting senior managers\u2019 jobs and his own compensation after revelations that workers had opened millions of unauthorized accounts in customers\u2019 names. She accused him of driving workers \u201cto the breaking point\u201d with aggressive goals of \u201c \u201d  \u2014   persuading customers to avail themselves of more bank services. \u201cAnd when it all blew up,\u201d she said, \u201cyou kept your job, you kept your   bonuses. \u201d _____ 8. Video of the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Okla. has prompted federal and local investigations. The victim, Terence Crutcher, was shot after walking to his vehicle with his hands up. The view from a patrol car\u2019s dashboard camera and a helicopter flying overhead was obstructed in the moments before he was Tasered and then shot. His family held a news conference, calling for charges to be filed against the white officer who shot him, Betty Shelby. _____ 9. We\u2019ve been following the uproar over extrajudicial killings in the Philippines in the weeks since the new president, Rodrigo Duterte, inaugurated a war on drugs. One of Mr. Duterte\u2019s most outspoken critics, Senator Leila de Lima, above, was just stripped of her post as head of a panel investigating the hundreds of killings and put under investigation over allegations that she had received payoffs from drug lords. She said she was the victim of a \u201cnew McCarthyism. \u201d _____ 10. A celebrity breakup doesn\u2019t usually qualify as top news, but this one involves a Hollywood powerhouse and an influential international philanthropy. Yes, Brangelina is fracturing back into Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. No explanations were offered, and both individuals asked the media to respect the family\u2019s privacy. _____ 11. Finally   \u2026     enough. Just don\u2019t. Play Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah. \u201d Anymore. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
