They have also offered to replace the dog with another one to help ease the pain of their loss.\\n\\n\u201cIf I had known he was to suffer such a gruesome ordeal, we would\u2019ve never picked him up at the animal shelter\u201d explains the owner, still visibly under shock. The neighbor\u2019s discovered in horror that their dog had been slain by the neighbors when they witnessed the man of Chinese origin grilling what seemed to be pieces of dog meat onto the barbecue. \u201cThere were also pieces of fur we found lying on top of the garbage container, as if he wanted us to find them, or was oblivious to the fact that we cared about our dog other than being just a piece of meat\u201d admitted the horrified neighbors.\\n\\nHumphrey was given a proper burial even though the man had cooked large parts of the dog before police officers arrived on the scene and apprehended the perpetrator. \u201cWe buried the parts we could find, what a horrible mess\u201d added the dog\u2019s owner, fighting to contain her tears. \u201cI just hope this awful man goes to prison for a long, long time\u201d she added.\\n\\nWorld News Daily Report \\nSOURCE '"}, "time": 1742628430.1144876}
