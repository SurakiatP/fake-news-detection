The patient is a woman who is not pregnant and lives in Brownsville, on the Gulf Coast near the Mexican border. The state\u2019s first case of chikungunya, a virus spread by the type of mosquito that carries Zika, was confirmed this year in Brownsville. Medical investigators must now determine whether the infection is spreading and, if so, how many people may have become infected. Officials have begun asking the woman\u2019s neighbors for urine samples and trapping mosquitoes to test for the virus. State and county health officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the case. The state medical operations center has been activated to help with contact tracing, mosquito surveillance and public education. The C. D. C. sent a training team to Texas this year but has not yet been asked to send an emergency response team, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the agency\u2019s director. No travel alert suggesting that pregnant women avoid the area will be issued now, Dr. Frieden said, because a single case does not constitute evidence of continuing local transmission. \u201cMost local cases are isolated dead ends,\u201d he said. Confirmation of several cases within a roughly    area for more than about two weeks, despite aggressive mosquito control, would prompt an alert from federal authorities. In Florida this year, the C. D. C. first advised pregnant women to avoid Wynwood, the neighborhood where the first cases in Miami were discovered, and later suggested they avoid all of   County. There have now been 4, 444 confirmed cases of Zika infection in the continental United States, including 1, 114 in pregnant women. Most of those infected had traveled to countries where the virus had been spreading, but 182 of the infections were contracted in Florida by people who had not visited such places. The Texas patient, who was not identified, told investigators that she had not traveled recently to anywhere the virus had been spreading. She had no other risk factors, such as having sex with someone who had visited an area with Zika transmission. \u201cWe knew it was only a matter of time before we saw a Zika case spread by a mosquito in Texas,\u201d said Dr. John Hellerstedt, the state health commissioner. Residents of Brownsville, a city of 183, 000, are concerned but not fearful, Mayor Tony Martinez said on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that people need to be alarmed about, but by the same token, they need to be cautious about it and report anything that needs to be reported to our health department,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cOn the coast, we kind of hoped that it wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the likelihood was pretty high. \u201d Dr. Carmen Rocco, a Brownsville pediatrician, said she had been checking her patients for Zika, but none so far had been infected. Most of her patients are poor enough to be on Medicaid, and she praised state health officials for reinstating a Medicaid benefit for mosquito repellent. \u201cFamilies were taking advantage of that,\u201d she said. While cold weather is arriving in other parts of the country, southern Texas has had an unusually hot autumn, making it more hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit Zika. Even in normal years, Aedes aegypti can persist in the Brownsville area well into December, so new cases may be confirmed in January or later. \u201cI predicted last April that we would see cases along the Texas Gulf Coast this summer,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cThis is now the one case we know about, but we don\u2019t know if there are dozens or hundreds. \u201d \u201cBecause of the lack of funds from Congress, there has been no active surveillance along the Gulf Coast,\u201d he added. \u201cThose cases in Florida were found by serendipity. \u201d Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Department of State Health Services in Texas, said the new case was discovered because the woman fell ill and was tested for Zika infection by a local doctor, who alerted public health authorities. All such cases are investigated to see if a patient has a travel history or other risk factors that might explain the infection. \u201cPregnant women should continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites there and elsewhere in Texas,\u201d Mr. Van Deusen said. Mosquito control measures will be stepped up, he said, but he did not know if they would involve aerial spraying of pesticides like Naled and larvicides like Bti. In the Wynwood section of Miami, mosquito swarms did not decrease enough to stop disease transmission until both types of aerial spraying were used. Thousands of Mexicans and Americans cross bridges over the Rio Grande each day in the Brownsville area it is possible that the virus has been spreading in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the border. In 2002, when there was a small outbreak of dengue in Brownsville, Dr. Hotez said, there turned out to be a much larger one in Matamoros. Both cities have poor neighborhoods where residents lack   and window screens, he said, but many more Matamoros residents live in poverty. \u201cWe won\u2019t know how widespread the virus really was until babies with microcephaly begin being born, probably in the spring,\u201d Dr. Hotez said, referring to the Zika virus and its link to the birth defect. \u201cAnd I expect it to return next year. \u201d The C. D. C. regularly collaborates with Mexican health authorities, and Mexico \u201chas quite a strong mosquito control program,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. Exactly how much Zika infection there may be in nearby parts of Mexico is unknown. \u201cWe know there is transmission in the border areas,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201cBut exactly where, we don\u2019t know. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562287.5940638}
